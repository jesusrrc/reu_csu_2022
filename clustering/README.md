# clustering: A Brief Topic Clustering Experiment

## Description

This folder contains the files/scripts used perform topic clustering on the dataset of IoT privacy policies.
Topic clustering is based on the idea of using "...probabilistic models that learn semantic structures from 
a collection of documents based on hierarchical Bayesian analysis" [1]. Particurlarly, we used k-means clustering
to infer topics from our dataset [2].

Moreover, we chose to visualize our topics with word-clouds, images that conveniently depict the words of each
topic [3].

## Files/Scripts

* `clustering.py`: Python script used to extract topics with K-means clustering
* `make_wordclouds.py`: Python script to generate word-clouds from sample_results.txt.
* `sample_results.txt`: A text file with the 12 topics generated by clustering.py
* `topics`: Folder with 12 word-clouds.

## Compilation

To extract the topics, please run the following script in this fashion, piping the output to a text file with this
name:

    python3 clustering.py | sample_results.txt

Then, you may build the twelve word-clouds with another script; note that this script assumes that the topics were
stored under `sample_results.txt`

    python3 make_wordclouds.py
