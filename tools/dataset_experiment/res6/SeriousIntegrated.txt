privacy policy​.
serious integrated, inc.
(“serious,” “we,” or “company”) is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected.
this privacy policy explains how we use the information we collect about you, how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and the procedures that we have to safeguard your privacy.
this privacy policy applies to the information requested from you when you access  or  (the “sites”).
other websites that may be affiliated with serious may have different privacy policies.
information collected.
we may collect your personally identifiable information (“personal information”) when you use our sites.
most of the personal information you give us is collected when you request literature/ information, participate in a contest, fill out a questionnaire/survey, or participate in an on-line discussion.
if you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the site(s), you may be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to company.
this may happen when you purchase product, sign up for services, or if you desire to receive marketing materials and information.
personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your full name, username, password, email address, mailing address, time zone, telephone number, location, application information, buying preferences and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in any online profile.
we use the information that you provide us to respond to your requests, customize your interactions with us, improve our offerings, provide materials or offers to you, allow you to participate in contests, and communicate with you.
we may also collect information that is provided to us by your browser or your interaction with our sites.
this may include information on the browser you used to come to our web site, the uniform resource locator (“url”) of the web site that you visited just before visiting our web site, which pages on our web site you visit, your activities on our web site, any search terms you entered, which url you go to next, and your internet protocol (“ip”) address.
use of cookies and web beacons.
a “cookie” is a small data file that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system.
we use cookies to better serve you when you return to our web site.
some of our web pages may send cookies when you visit our web site, make purchases, respond to online surveys or promotions, participate in a contest, or request information.
accepting the cookies used on our sites enables our web servers to identify your system by reading the cookie that has been stored on your system, but our web server cannot identify you unless you enter your personal information.
cookies that are placed when visiting our site cannot be used to obtain your personal information at another site.
cookies may also enable you to register and login to access different portions of our sites that may require a username and password.
the information collected online permits us to analyze traffic patterns on our site and is used on an anonymized basis.

this log data may include information such as your ip address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the websites you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click.
for most users accessing the internet from an internet service provider the ip address will be different every time you log on.
we use log data to monitor the use of the sites, for technical administration, to help run our sites more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, to monitor the nature and level of activity on our sites, to contact you regarding our products and services (but only to the extent permitted by applicable law), and to evaluate the effectiveness of any advertising and promotions.

newsletters and promotional e-mails – as a service to our customers, we may e-mail to you newsletters, promotional information and other information, using your personal information collected online.
