cookies.
we use cookies and analyse the information they provide to enhance your user experience.
this information is not used to develop a personal profile of you.
what is a cookie.
a cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a “device”) browser from a website’s computer and is stored on your device’s hard drive.
each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.
if personal data is collected, websites and apps must get consent to send cookies to your computer or mobile device unless the cookies are strictly necessary to provide services to you.
you can withdraw your consent to those cookies at any time even if you have previously consented.
our website and app only collect personal data through cookies which are strictly necessary to provide services to you.
how do we use cookies.
the table below explains what cookies we use on our website and app and why we use them.
it notes whether they are.
strictly necessary cookie.
these cookies are essential to enable you to receive a service on a website or app such as logging in to the portal or app.
functionality cookie.
these cookies allow the website or app to remember choices you make (such as your log in details) and customised preference settings (e.
g.
your fahrenheit / centigrade preference).
they also enable enhanced, more personal features, e.
g.
a website or app may be able to provide you with local weather reports by using a cookie to remember which region you are in.
information collected by “functionality” cookies may or may not be anonymised, but they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
performance cookie.
these cookies collect information about how visitors use a website or app, for instance, which pages visitors go to most often and if they get error messages from web pages or screens.
these cookies do not collect information that identifies a visitor.
any information collected by these cookies is anonymous.
we only use such information to improve our website and app.
we also state in the table whether a cookie is a “persistent” or “session” cookie.
the difference is that.
persistent cookies remain on your device between browsing sessions.
they are activated each time you visit the website that created that particular cookie.
for example, where a “persistent cookie” is used on a website to remember your log-in details, you will not need to enter those details each time you visit that website.
session cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session.
a browser session starts when you open the browser window and finishes when you close the browser window.
session cookies are created temporarily.
once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.
