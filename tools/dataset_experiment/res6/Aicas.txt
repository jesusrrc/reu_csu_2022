the legal basis for the processing of personal data.
in general, the following applies when we process personal data.
in so far as we obtain your consent for processing procedures of personal data, article 6, paragraph 1, letter a) of the eu general data processing regulation (gdpr) acts as the legal basis for the processing of personal data.
in the case of the processing of personal data which is needed for the performance of a contract with you, article 6, paragraph 1, letter b) of the gdpr acts as the legal basis.
this also applies already if the processing for the performance of pre-contractual measures is necessary.
in so far as the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a legal obligation to which we are bound, article 6, paragraph 1, letter c) of the gdpr acts as the legal basis.
in the event that the vital interests of yours or another natural person render the processing of personal data necessary, article 6, paragraph 1, letter d) of the gdpr acts as the legal basis.
if the processing is necessary for the protection of a legitimate interest of us or of a third party and your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms do not override this interest, article 6, paragraph 1, letter f) of the gdpr acts as the legal basis.
data deletion and duration of archiving.
generally we delete or block the personal data as soon as the purpose of the archiving no longer applies.
data can also be archived if this was stipulated by the european or national legislative body in eu regulations, laws or other provisions to which we, as the controller, are subject.
data is also blocked or deleted if a retention period required by the above-mentioned regulations etc.
expiresunless it is necessary that the data continues to be archived for the conclusion or performance of a contract.
in specific terms this means.
if we are processing the personal data on the basis of consent for data processing (article 6, paragraph 1, letter a) of the general data protection regulation (gdpr), the processing is ended when you revoke your consent unless a further legal basis for processing the data exists.
this is the case if, at the time of the revocation, we are still entitled to process your data for the purpose of the performance of a contract, or if the data processing is necessary to protect our legitimate interests (on this point see also below).
if, by way of exception, we are processing the data by reason of our legitimate interests (article 6, paragraph 1, letter f) of the gdpr as part of a previous assessment, we will save this data until the legitimate interest no longer exists, the assessment comes to a different conclusion, or you have lodged a valid objection pursuant to article 21 of the gdpr (on this point see the highlighted “note on a particular right to object” under c.
).
if we are processing the data for the purpose of the performance of a contract we will save the data until the contract has been finally performed and brought to a conclusion and no further claims can asserted under the contract, in other words until the matter becomes time-barred.
the general period of prescription according to § 195 of the german civil code is three (3) years.
however, certain claims, for example claims for compensation, only become time barred after 30 years (cf.
§ 197 german civil code).
if there is a legitimate reason for assuming that this is relevant in a particular case, we will save the personal data during this period of time.
the above-mentioned periods of prescription commence at the end of the year (therefore on december 31) in which the claim arose and the obligee becomes aware or should have become aware of the circumstances giving rise to the claim and the person of the liable party becomes or should have become aware of the foregoing without gross negligence.
we wish to point out that we are also subject to statutory retention obligations for reasons associated with taxation and book-keeping.
these oblige us to archive certain data as evidence for our book-keeping which can include personal data for a period which can range from six (6) to ten (10) years.
these retention periods take precedence over the above-mentioned deletion obligations.
the retention periods also commence at the end of the year in question, and therefore december 31.
sources of personal data.
the personal data we process originates primarily from the data subject himself or herself, for example by these persons.
as users of our web-site via their browser and terminal (e.
g.
a pc, smartphone, tablet or notebook) transmitting information such as their ip address to our web-server,.
as interested parties requesting information material or quotation.
as clients confirm an order with us close a contract with us,.
as representatives of the press asking for press releases, a statement or similar,.
as suppliers delivering goods to us which we have ordered or performing services or similar for us.
as a rare exception, the personal data we process may also come from third parties, for example if aperson is acting on behalf of another person.
general categories, purposes and legal basis for processing personal data.
we process the following categories of personal data.
users of our web-site,.
interested parties,.
representatives of the press.
clients, and.
suppliers.
depending on the category of the data involved we process personal data for the following purposeson the legal basis specified in the general data protection regulation (gdpr).
user data.
we do not collect and process data about users of our web-site in personal form.
we cannot attribute this data to a particular persons the ip address is only processed in an anonymized form.
on the other hand in so far as personal data is involved in exceptional cases, we process this data for the protection of our legitimate interests on the basis of article 6, paragraph 1, letter f) of the gdpr.
our legitimate interests in this sense are our interest in the security and integrity of our website and the data on our web-servers (particularly the detection of disturbances and malfunctions as well as the tracking of unauthorized access) plus marketing interests and interests in statistical surveys for the improvement of our web-site, our services and what we have to offer).
after giving the matter our due consideration we came to the conclusion that the processing of data to protect the above legitimate interests is necessary and overrides your fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of personal data.
data of interested parties/data of representatives of the press.
in so far as we process the data of parties interested in our services or of the representatives of the press, this is only done if you enter this data in an input field and send it to us or enter this data in an email for the purpose of a query which is then sent to us.
these entries are voluntary we then only process this data in order to deal with your enquiry.
this data which is voluntarily sent to us for the purpose of the supply of information about our services is processed as pre-contractual processing in accordance with article 6, paragraph 1, letter b) of the gdpr and/or on the basis of the consent you grant by sending the consent you give in accordance with article 6, paragraph 1, letter a) of the gdpr.
client’s data.
we process the data of the our clients for the purpose of the performance of a contract as set out in article 6, paragraph 1, letter b) of the gdpr and/or on the basis of consent which is granted pursuant to article 6, paragraph 1, letter a) of the gdpr.
this also applies to processing procedures which are necessary for pre-contractual activities (for example as part of the preparation and negotiation of offers).
suppliers’ and business partners’ data.
we process the data of the our suppliers and business partners for the purpose of the performance of a contract as set out in article 6, paragraph 1, letter b) of the gdpr and/or on the basis of consent which is granted pursuant to article 6, paragraph 1, letter a) of the gdpr.
this also applies to processing procedures which are necessary for pre-contractual activities (for example as part of the preparation and negotiation of offers).
recipients and categories of recipients of the personal data.
your personal data is only passed to third parties or others if this is necessary for the purpose of the performance of a contract (for example for processing of an order) or for invoicing purposes (for example for executing a payment process during the purchase of goods or services) and if there is a legitimate interest in the transmission of the data which overrides your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms, or you have previously and validly granted your consent.
the categories of recipients can be.
service providers.
delivery service-providers, suppliers.
payment service-providers, banks.
tax advisers.
data processing related to the distribution of the newsletter.
it is possible to subscribe to a free newsletter in our web-site or while making an enquiry.
when subscribing for the newsletter the data in the input mask is sent to us.
this information is.
email address.
title/form of address, given and family name, company name, homepage, phone number.
how did you hear about us.
(optional).
feedback (optional free form fields).
when subscribing to the newsletter the following data is also collected (opt-in-verification).
your ip address, and.
the data and time of your subscription.
the purpose of this is the prevention of the misuse of the services or your email address and also compliance with our statutory obligation to demonstrate that the customer has truly opted in to the use of his email address – in other words he has expressly granted his consent to receive the newsletter.
subscribing to our newsletter uses what is called a “double opt-in process”.
this means that after subscribing you receive an email which asks you to confirm your subscription.
this confirmation is necessary so that no-one can subscribe using another person’s email address.
when you click on the link by which you confirm your registration your ip address is collected along with the exact point in time (date and time) of the click.
the purpose of this item of data processing is to comply with our statutory obligation to prove that the customer has truly opted in to the use of his email address – in other words he has expressly granted his consent to receive the newsletter.
in order to process the data your consent is obtained as part of the registration process and your attention drawn to this data security statement.
if you purchase goods or services on our website and in doing so record your email address, as a consequence we can use it to send you a newsletter.
in such a case only direct advertisements for similar goods or services will be sent via the newsletter.
the data is not passed to third parties.
the exception is if there is a legal obligation to disclose the data.
the data is only used for the distribution of the newsletter.
the purposes of data processing.
the purpose of collecting and processing the user’s email address is to send the newsletter.
we use the email address for promotional purposes.
the purpose of collecting the ip address and the time of the click on the confirmation link in the double opt-in email is to enable us to comply with our statutory obligation to prove that we have obtained the express consent of the customer.
the purpose of collecting further personal data as part of the subscription process is to prevent the misuse of the services or the email address used.
the potential archiving of your unsubscription from the newsletter for up to three years has thepurpose of proving that consent was previously granted.
this therefore enables us to defend ourselves against potential claims.
the legal basis for the data processing.
the legal basis for processing the data after the user subscribes to the newsletters is your consent in accordance with article 6, paragraph 1, letter a) ofthe gdpr.
in the event of previous purchases of goods or services, the legal basis for the data processing in the context of the newsletter is § 7, paragraph 3 of the law against unfair competition.
the legal basis for saving the ip address and the point in time at which you clicked on the confirmation link in the double opt-in email and for any possible additional archiving for up to three years after you have unsubscribed from the newsletter is our legitimate interest pursuant to article 6, paragraph 1, letter f) of the gdpr.
in this case the legitimate interest consists of proving your previous grant of consent and the ability to defend ourselves against claims based on the use of your email address.
duration of the archiving.
the data is deleted as soon as it is no longer needed to achieve the purpose for which it was collected.
thus your email address is saved all the while the subscription to the newsletter is active.
we can save the email addresses for up to three years before we delete them as well as the data we collected during confirmation of the consent given for sending the newsletter on the basis of our legitimate interests so that we can demonstrate that consent was previously given.
the purpose of processing this data is restricted to a possible defense against claims.
an individual request for deletion is possible at all times in so far as the previous existence of a consent is confirmed.
other data also collected during the subscription process is usually deleted after a period of seven days.
the right to object and the right to erasure.
the user can unsubscribe from the newsletter in any form, at any time and free of charge.
there is a link for this purpose in every newsletter.
this makes it possible to revoke the consent given to saving the personal data collected during the subscription process.
contacting by email, fax and phone call.
if you wish you can contact us in several ways.
you will find our email address, phone number and fax number for this purpose on our website.
if you send us an email, call us or send a fax we will also inevitably process your personal data as the personal data transmitted with the email, fax or your phone will be saved by us or our systems.
the data is not passed to third parties in this context.
the data is only used for the distribution of the newsletter.
the purposes of data processing.
the processing of the personal data when contacting us by email, fax or phone is so that we can deal with your request and the approach you made to us.
it is essential that we have your email address, fax or phone number so that we can respond.
this also constitutes the legitimate interest in processing the data.
the legal basis for data processing.
given the existence of consent which can be seen from the fact that you contacted us, the legal basis for processing the data is article 6, paragraph 1, letter a) of the gdpr and, apart from that, our legitimate interest in the data processing in accordance with article 6, paragraph 1, letter f) of the gdpr.
if the purpose of the contact or your request is the conclusion of a contract, the additional legal basis for the processing is article 6, paragraph 1, letter b) of the gdpr (execution of pre-contractual measures).
duration of the archiving.
the data is deleted as soon as it is no longer needed to achieve the purpose for which it was collected.
for the personal data which was sent by email, this is the case if the relevant exchange with you is at an end and we have then waited for a period of up to 3 months to establish whether we must refer again to your request and the details of the exchange.
the conversation is at an end if it can be gathered from the circumstances that the matter in question has been definitely settled.
fax data is stored separately from printed data in the fax machine’s memory.
after the fax has been printed out the memory space which was used is released so that the next fax can be received and saved there.
after being printed out, parts of the fax can remain temporarily in the fax machine’s memory until it is overwritten by the next fax to be received.
this normally leads to the automatic deletion of the data after about 1 – 2 weeks.
if the fax is a computer fax we receive the fax as an email and the information we have provided on emails applies accordingly.
in the case of an incoming or outgoing phone call your phone number or your name / company name which you have registered with your telephone provider as well as the date and time of the call are stored in what is called a “ring memory” in our phone system.
this memory overwrites the oldest data with the new data.
in normal circumstances this means that the data is automatically deleted in the phone system after about 3-4 months.
it may happen that due to commercial or fiscal law the exchange is subject to a retention obligation which then comes into play (cf.
the information above in the section “data deletion and retention period”) .
the right to object and the right to erasure.
you may at any time revoke consent given for the processing of the personal data and object to further data processing because of a legitimate interest (cf.
the advice on a particular right to object under c of this data protection information).
in such a case the conversation cannot be continued.
you can revoke the consent and object to further data processing without any need for a specific form (e.
g.
you can use email).
in this case all personal data which was saved in the course of the contact with you is deleted.
b.
the scope of the processing of personal data via our website.
as a matter of principle we only collect and use the personal data of users during the use of our website in so far as this is necessary for the provision of a functioning web-site, its content and our services.
normally the personal data of our users is collected and used only after the user has granted his/her consent.
the exception is such cases in which it is not factually possible to obtain consent in advance and/or the processing is permitted by the provisions of law.
provision of the web-site and creation of log files.
every time the web-site is accessed our system automatically collects data and information for technical reasons.
this is saved in the server’s log files.
this information is.
the data and time of access,.
the url of the web-site from which access was made (the referrer),.
the web-sites which were accessed by the user’s system via our web-site,.
the user’s screen resolution,.
the file(s) accessed and a report of the success of the access,.
the amount of data sent,.
the user’s internet service-provider,.
the browser, browser type and version, the browser engine and engine version,.
the operating system, operating system version and type, and.
the user’s anonymized ip address and internet service-provider.
this data is processed separately from other data.
this data is not processed in combination with the user’s other personal data.
we cannot attribute this data to a particular person.
the purposes of data processing.
the temporary processing of the data by the system is necessary so that it is possible to send the contents of our web-site to the user’s computer.
the user’s ip addressmust be saved for the duration of the session to achieve this.
data is saved in log files to ensure the functionality of the web-site.
the data also enables us to optimize our offering and the web-site, and to protect the security of our computer system.
the data is not evaluated for marketing purposes in this connection.
the legal basis for the data processing.
the data and the log files are temporarily saved on the legal basis of article 6, paragraph 1, letter f) of the gdpr our overriding legitimate interest in this data processing is to be found in the purposes stated above.
duration of the archiving the data is deleted as soon as it is no longer needed to achieve the purpose for which it was collected.
in the case of data capture for the provision of the web-site, the data is deleted when the session is terminated.
the data saved in the log files is deleted after no more than seven days.
it is not possible to save the data for longer.
in this case the users’ ip addresses are deleted or distorted so that it is no longer possible to attribute them to the client accessing the website.
the right to object and the right to erasure.
the capture of data is essential for the provision of the web-site, and the saving of data in log files is necessary for the operation of the web-site.
as a consequence the user has no right to object to this practice.
however, the user may terminate the use of the web-site at any time and therefore prevent the continued collection of the data specified above.
contact form and email contact.
our website contains contact forms which can be used for contacting us electronically in various areas and on various subjects.
if you take advantage of this facility the data you enter in the mask is sent to us and saved.
the data processing which follows relates basically to the matter associated with the contact form.
using our forms you can.
download a personal edition,.
download a jamaicacar sdk,.
submit a jamaicavm evaluation request,request a veriflux evaluation,.
request a white paper.
you can find details of the information you request in the web form.
the mandatory fields in the web form are clearly marked with an asterisk.
the data we request in the mandatory fields is essential so that we can process the data you have entered.
the following data is also saved when the message is sent.
the user’s ip address,.
date and time of the transmission.
the data identified in the mandatory fields is data which is essential as without it we cannot respond to your enquiry or deal with the approach you made to us.
your consent for processing the data is obtained before the data is sent.
this relates also to the use of the data for promotional purposes as well as to this data privacy statement.
alternatively you can contact us via the email address we provide.
in this case the user’s personal data transmitted with the email is saved.
in this case the data is not passed to third parties.
the data is only used for the distribution of the newsletter.
the purposes of data processing.
when you download material you thereby conclude a user and license agreement with us.
you are therefore obliged to accept the license conditions before thedownload.
a further purpose of the processing of the personal data from the input mask is that it enables us to deal with the approach you made to us and to clarify your request.
contacting you also constitutes the legitimate interest in processing the data.
the purpose of processing the other personal data during the transmission procedure is to prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure that out information system remains secure.
the legal basis for data processing.
if downloads are requested the legal basis for the processing is article 6, paragraph 1, letter b) of the gdpr, to be specific, data processing for the performance and execution of the license agreement.
the legal basis for processing the data is also our legitimate interest in the data processing as set out in article 6, paragraph 1, letter f) of the gdpr.
the legitimate interest is constituted by our need to process the data so we can deal with and respond to your enquiry and the approach you made to us.
the legal basis for processing the other personal data which is processed during the transmission procedure is our legitimate interest in the data processing in accordance with article 6, paragraph 1, letter f) of the gdpr which in this case consists of preventing the misuse of the contact form and ensuring the protection of our it systems.
duration of the archiving.
in the case of the license agreements we save the data until the agreement comes to an end and no claims arising from the agreement can be asserted (period of prescription).
the personal data from the input mask of the contact form and the data sent by email are deleted when the matter clearly to a definitive end.
the exchange and the contractual data are subject, as applicable under commercial or fiscal law, to a retention period which then commences (cf.
the information above in the section “data deletion and retention period”).
the additional data also collected during the transmission process is deleted after a period not exceeding seven days.
the right to object and the right to erasure.
you can object to further data processing at any time due to a legitimate interest (cf.
the note about a specific right to object in section c of this data privacy statement.
in such a case the matter cannot be taken any further.
the objection to further data protection can be lodged with us in any form (e.
g.
by email).
in this case all personal data which was saved in the course of the contact with you is deleted.
data processing for the purposes of performing a contract are not affected by this objection.
use of cookies by us and by third party provider.
when accessing individual web pages we use so-called cookies.
cookies are small text files which are installed on the terminal (pc, smartphone, tablet etc.
).
if you access a website a cookie can be saved in your browser.
this cookie includes a characteristic sequence of characters which enable the browser to be unmistakably identified if the page is accessed again.
it can also happen that cookies are used by third party service-providers.
these cookies could also make it possible to analyze the way in which the user surfs the internet.
if this is the case we will inform you separately and directly about this in the information about third party provider tools (such as analysis tools, plugins or similar) of this data privacy statement.
when you access our website you are informed about the use of cookies for analysis purposes and your consent obtained for the processing of the personal data used in this connection.
cookies are used to make our website useable or configure it so that it is more user-friendly.
some parts of our web-site require that the browser accessing our site can also be identified after switchingto a different page.
the following data is temporarily saved in the cookies at this time.
the language settings.
our content management system uses these cookies which are also necessary for technical reasons to make functions such as logging into the administration area possible or the writing and posting of comments for registered visitors (if we activate this).
it is necessary to place cookies so that we can identify visitors who have logged in.
the purposes of data processing.
the purpose of using cookies needed for technical reasons is to simplify the use of the web-site for users.
some of the functions of our web-site cannot be provided without the use of cookies.
for these it is necessary that the browser is re-identified after switching to a different page.
the user data collected by the cookies needed for technical purpose is not used for creating user profiles.
analysis cookies are used for the purpose of improving the quality of our web-site and its contents.
by the analysis cookies we learn how the web-site is used and can therefore continuously optimize our offering.
the legal basis for the data processing.
the legal basis for the processing of personal data by means of cookies is article 6, paragraph 1, letter f) of the gdpr, and is therefore a legitimate interest on our part.
our legitimate interest is to be found in the purposes stated above.
if the user has granted consent for this purpose the legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies for analytical purposes is article 6, paragraph 1, letter a) of the gdpr and, in other respects a legitimate interest on our part by reason of the purposes already mentioned pursuant to article 6, paragraph 1, letter f) of the gdpr.
duration of the archiving.
some of the cookies we use are deleted again at the end of the browser session, in other words when you close your browser (these are called “session cookies”).
other cookies remain on your terminal and enable us or our service providers partner (third party providers) to recognize your browser on your next visit (”permanent cookies”).
in all other respects we save the data collected on the basis of a legitimate interest until the legitimate interest no longer exists, the assessment comes to a different conclusion, or you have lodged a valid objection pursuant to article 21 of the gdpr (on this point see the highlighted “note on a particular right to object” in section c).
whether or not the legitimate interest still exists is checked regularly, at least once per year.
in particular, our interest no longer exists if, due to the lapse of time, the data is no longer sufficiently relevant for us with regard to the evaluation and statistics of the use of the website.
we assume this to be no longer than three years.
the right to object and right of erasure cookies are saved on your computer and transmitted from there to our site.
you therefore have full control over the use of cookies.
you can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the settings in your internet browser.
cookies which have already been saved can be deleted at any time.
this can also be done automatically.
we understand a “do not track” setting of your browser of this nature to be an objection to the further collection and use of your personal data.
note.
if cookies for our web-site are deactivated, it is possible that all functions of the web-site can no longer be used to their full extent.
use of google maps.
this website used google maps, a map service of google inc.
, 1600 amphitheatre parkway, mountain view, ca 94043, usa (“google”), to provide an interactive map.
by the use of google maps information about your use of this web-site (including your ip address) can be sent to a google server in the usa and saved there.
google may pass the information obtained by maps to third parties in so far as this is required by law or in so far as third parties process this data on behalf of google.
in no case will google combine your ip address with other google data.
nevertheless, it would be technically feasible that, based on the data it has received, google could identify at least individual users.
it would be possible that personal data and personality profiles of users of google’s web-site could be processed for other purposes over which we neither have nor can have any influence.
the purposes of data processing.
the purpose for using google maps is to improve the quality of our website and its content as well as to provide you with a simple, useful and well-known map service for orientation purposes, to show where we are located and to enable you to plan how to reach us etc.
the legal basis for the data processing.
the legal basis for the processing of personal data by means of maps is article 6, paragraph 1, letter f) of the gdpr, and is therefore a legitimate interest on our part.
our legitimate interest is to be found in the purposes stated above.
google inc.
has joined the “eu-us-privacy shield“ so that data transmission to the usa is permitted.
duration of the archiving.
by using your browser settings you, as the user, can decide for yourself about the implementation of the javascript code needed for this tool.
you can deactivate or restrict the execution of cookies by changing the settings in your internet browser.
note.
if the execution of cookies is deactivated, it is possible that all functions of the web-site can no longer be used to their full extent.
in all other respects we save the data collected on the basis of a legitimate interest until the legitimate interest no longer exists, the assessment comes to a different conclusion, or you have lodged a valid objection pursuant to article 21 of the gdpr (on this point see the highlighted “note on a particular right to object” in section c).
whether or not the legitimate interest still exists is checked regularly, at least once per year.
in particular, our interest no longer exists if, due to the lapse of time, the data is no longer sufficiently relevant for us with regard to the evaluation and statistics of the use of the website.
we assume this to be no longer than three years.
the right to object and the right to erasure.
