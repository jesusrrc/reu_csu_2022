this includes information on your identity, such as your name, e-mail address, or postal address.
information that cannot be directly associated with your identity (such as statistical data, for example on the number of users of the online site) is, on the other hand, not considered to be personal information.

your data is stored by us on specially protected servers within the european union.
technical and organizational measures are used to protect these servers against the loss or destruction of, access or changes to, or the dissemination of your data by unauthorized persons.
only a limited number of persons will have access to your data.
these individuals are responsible for the technical, commercial, or editorial support of the servers.
despite regular controls, complete protection against all risks is not possible.
we assume no liability for disclosure of your information due to transmission errors, third-party access, or causes beyond our control.
your personal information is transmitted in encrypted form over the internet.
we use tls/ssl encryption (transport layer security/secure socket layer) for data transmission.

if we employ external service providers in the provision of services, they shall only access personal information for the purpose of providing services to us.
we use technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance with  data protection regulations and also obligate compliance on the part of our external service providers in this respect.

this may especially involve the provision of information for law enforcement purposes, for averting danger, or for enforcing intellectual property rights.
data deletion and storage period.
we delete or block your personal information as soon as the reason for storing it no longer applies.
