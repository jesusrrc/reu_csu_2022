registration.
in order to be able to use the functions of this app, you must set up a personal user account (hereinafter “account”).
you can store your personal information (e.
g.
floor plans) in the account.
in order to set up a personal account, users must enter their email address and a freely selectable password, which at the same time serve as an access code for the account.
with the same access data, the user can also log on the magicplan cloud, which is part of the app, at                                    .
after successful registration, the user automatically receives confirmation by e-mail.
in this way, the user concludes the contract for the provision of the account with us.
in addition, users can store their personal contact details in their account and update these details at any time.
unless you “log off” by clicking, so-called persistent cookies are stored on your terminal device, which serve to ensure that the user does not have to log on again during subsequent visits to the app.

app permissions.
in order to provide you with the functionalities of the app, the app must be able to access various functions and data on your mobile device.
for this purpose, it is technically absolutely necessary that you grant the app the following access permissions for the purposes described in each case.
otherwise, the app is not fully usable for technical reasons.
the reason for this is that the permission settings in smartphone operating systems are usually programmed in such a way that some authorizations can only be granted or requested together and not in the form of individual partial authorizations.
therefore, sensopia is dependent in such cases on requesting the entire authorization from customers, even if only part of it is required and used specifically.
in the following, we will inform you about the permissions required by this app, whereby we will only use these to the extent required in each case, even if an authorization technically includes more.
the legal basis for the associated processing of your data is art.
