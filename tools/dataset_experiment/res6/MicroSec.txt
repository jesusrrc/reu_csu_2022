cookies and other web technologies.
cookies, web beacons and/or similar devices were originally designed to help a website distinguish a user’s browser from a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site or to track the user’s activities.

a web beacon is a small transparent gif image that is embedded in an html page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed.
a similar device may be used by which a product or service may send data to a server when a set of user-initiated events occur such as when a selection is made.
this device is similar to a cookie in that it tracks your visit and the data can only be read by the server that receives the data.
it is different than a cookie in that it is not browser-based, may not function as an identification card, and does not store any data on your computer.
these tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and the address of the website from which you arrived at our website.
they may also collect information about.

consumers that are residents of the state of california, under the california consumer privacy act of 2018, civil code sections 1798.
100 et seq.
(the “ccpa”), have the right to request from companies conducting business in california a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes.
alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of the consumer’s personal information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide the consumer with information on how to exercise the consumer’s disclosure choice options.
microsec qualifies for the alternative option.
we have a comprehensive privacy statement, and provide you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.
