mitigate risk, ensure safety and drive efficiency.
aivid empowers businesses to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and strive towards a safe & high-quality workplace by automating human observation-based sop compliance & process inspections analyzing cctv feed.
aivid can be easily integrated with your existing ip camera setup to get you up and running quickly.
with the capabilities of aivid bots, our deep learning models trained to detect specific activities and send out real-time alerts.
select from a predefined activity checklist powered by aivid ai bots to get automated visual inspection at a click of a button & generate real-time notifications, insights, and inspection reports for multiple locations.
and all of this can be controlled with an easy-to-use cloud-based operations portal for managing the aivid bots, checklists, pre-defined activities, and insights.
the platform is powered by the latest cloud technology supporting a distributed architecture.
this enables efficiently scale to multiple locations, with multi-level hierarchy to easily add multiple sites under a cluster/ circle and allows processing at the edge by sending only processed data from each site to the centralized server, thus reducing bandwidth requirement.
