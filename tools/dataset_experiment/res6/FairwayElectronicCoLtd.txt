we are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise.
data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the fairway family office ag.
the use of the internet pages of the fairway family office ag is possible without any indication of personal data.
however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary.
if the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.
the processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the general data protection regulation (gdpr), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the fairway family office ag.
by means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.
furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
as the controller, the fairway family office ag has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website.
however, internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed.
for this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.
g.
by telephone.

f) pseudonymisation                            pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.

cookies.
the internet pages of the fairway family office ag use cookies.
cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an internet browser.
many internet sites and servers use cookies.
many cookies contain a so-called cookie id.
a cookie id is a unique identifier of the cookie.
it consists of a character string through which internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific internet browser in which the cookie was stored.
this allows visited internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other internet browsers that contain other cookies.
a specific internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie id.
through the use of cookies, the fairway family office ag can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
by means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind.
cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users.
the purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website.
the website user that uses cookies, e.
g.
does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user’s computer system.
another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop.
the online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.
the data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an internet browser or other software programs.
this is possible in all popular internet browsers.
if the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.
5.
collection of general data and information.
the website of the fairway family office ag collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website.
this general data and information are stored in the server log files.
collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the internet site, (6) an internet protocol address (ip address), (7) the internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
when using these general data and information, the fairway family office ag does not draw any conclusions about the data subject.
rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.
therefore, the fairway family office ag analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.
the anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.

by registering on the website of the controller, the ip address—assigned by the internet service provider (isp) and used by the data subject—date, and time of the registration are also stored.
the storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses.
insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller.
this data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
the registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question.
registered persons are free to change the personal data specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.
