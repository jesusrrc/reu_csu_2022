cookies – a cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s computer that is tied to information about the user.
when you visit the site, we send one or more cookies to your computer or other browsing device.
we use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends.
most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
however, some ul features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
web beacons – web pages may contain electronic images (called a “single-pixel gif” or “web beacon”) that allow a web site to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.
we use web beacons to track the effectiveness of an email campaign and to transfer an individual’s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) and associate your updated information into our database.
our practice is to include web beacons in html-formatted email messages (messages that include graphics) that we send directly or through third parties in order to determine, among many other items, which email messages were opened and to note whether a message was acted upon.
in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.

ul uses commercially reasonable efforts to employ security measures designed to protect your personal information from loss, destruction, or access by unauthorized persons.
these include, but are not limited to.

technology safeguards, like the use of anti-virus and endpoint protection software, and monitoring of our systems and data centers to ensure that they comply with our security policies.
