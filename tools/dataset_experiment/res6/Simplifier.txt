no advertising from third parties is placed on our pages.
the doubleclick cookie is used here for remarketing purposes only.

newsletter.
information on the newsletter and consents.
with the following information we inform you about the contents of our newsletter as well as the registration, dispatch and statistical evaluation procedure and your rights of objection.
by subscribing to our newsletter you agree to the receipt and the described procedures.
contents of the newsletter.
we will only send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications containing advertising information (hereinafter “newsletters”) with the consent of the recipients or a legal permission.
if the contents of a newsletter are specifically described within the scope of a registration, they are decisive for the consent of the users.
in addition, our newsletters contain information on legal topics, especially in the field of marketing law, data protection and our law firm (this may include references to blog articles, lectures or workshops, our services or online appearances).
double-opt-in and logging.
the registration for our newsletter takes place in a so-called double opt-in procedure.
this means that after registration you will receive an e-mail asking you to confirm your registration.
this confirmation is necessary so that no one can log in with other e-mail addresses.
subscriptions to the newsletter are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process in accordance with legal requirements.
this includes the storage of the login and confirmation time, as well as the ip address.
also the changes of your data stored with mailchimp are logged.
usage of the “mailchimp” mail service provider.
the newsletter is sent via “mailchimp”, a newsletter distribution platform of the us provider rocket science group, llc, 675 ponce de leon ave ne #5000, atlanta, ga 30308, usa.
the e-mail addresses of our newsletter recipients, as well as their further data described in the context of these notes, are stored on the servers of mailchimp in the usa.
mailchimp uses this information to send and evaluate the newsletter on our behalf.
furthermore, mailchimp can use this data according to its own information to optimize or improve its own services, e.
g.
to technically optimize the sending and presentation of the newsletter or for economic purposes, in order to determine from which countries the recipients come.
however, mailchimp does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write them down or pass them on to third parties.
we trust in the reliability and it and data security of mailchimp.
mailchimp is certified under the us-eu data protection agreement „privacy shield“ and thus commits itself to comply with eu data protection regulations.
furthermore, we have concluded a „data-processing-agreement“ with mailchimp.
this is a contract in which mailchimp undertakes to protect the data of our users, to process them on our behalf in accordance with their data protection regulations and in particular not to pass them on to third parties.
the data protection regulations of mailchimp can be viewed here.
credentials.
to subscribe for the newsletter, it is sufficient in principle if you enter your e-mail address.
optionally, we ask you to enter your first and last name.
this information is only used to personalise the newsletter.
furthermore, we ask you also optionally to indicate companies.
we only use this information to adapt the contents of the newsletter to the interests of our readers.
statistical surveys and analyses.
the newsletters contain a so-called “web-beacon”, i.
e.
a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the mailchimp server when the newsletter is opened.
within the scope of this retrieval, technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your ip address and time of retrieval are initially collected.
this information is used to technically improve the services based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behaviour based on their retrieval locations (which can be determined using the ip address) or access times.
the statistical surveys also include determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked.
for technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients.
however, it is neither our endeavour, nor that of mailchimp, to observe individual users.
the evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our contents to them or to send different contents according to the interests of our users.
online access and data management.
there are cases where we direct the newsletter recipients to the web pages of mailchimp.
for example, our newsletters contain a link with which the newsletter recipients can call up the newsletter online (e.
g.
in case of display problems in the e-mail program).
furthermore, newsletter recipients can subsequently correct their data, e.
g.
the e-mail address.
likewise, the privacy policy of mailchimp is only available on their site.
in this context we pointed out that cookies are used on the websites of mailchimp and thus personal data are processed by mailchimp, its partners and service providers (e.
g.
google analytics).
we have no influence on this data collection.
further information can be found in the privacy policy of mailchimp.
we would also like to draw your attention to the possibilities of objecting to the collection of data for advertising purposes on the website.
.
cancellation/revocation.
you can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.
e.
revoke your consent.
