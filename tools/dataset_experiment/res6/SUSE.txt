doubleclick ad exchange.
while we do not incorporate code or functionality from doubleclick, this website uses the online marketing tool doubleclick by google.
doubleclick uses cookies to display adverts that are relevant to the user, to improve reports on campaign performance, and to avoid users being shown the same adverts multiple times.
via a cookie id, google records which adverts are displayed in which browser and is thus able to prevent the adverts from being shown multiple times.
furthermore, with the aid of cookie ids, doubleclick can record conversions relating to ad requests.
this is the case, for example, when a user sees a doubleclick advert and later visits the advertiser’s website using the same browser and makes a purchase on that website.
according to google, doubleclick cookies contain no personal information.
through the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the google server.
we have no influence on the scope and further use of the data collected through use of this tool by google and are therefore providing you with information based on what we know.
through the integration of doubleclick, google receives the information that you have accessed the relevant section of our website or that you have clicked on one of our adverts.
if you are registered with a google service, google can link the visit to your account.
even if you are not registered with google or are not logged in, the provider may learn and store your ip address.
you can prevent participation in this tracking process in a number of ways.
a) by configuring your browser software accordingly.
in particular, the suppression of third-party cookies means that you will not receive adverts from third-party providers.
b) by disabling the cookies for conversion tracking, by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain "googleadservices.

you can identify the provider of the plug-in by the marking on the box, via the provider’s initial letters or logo.
we give you the opportunity to communicate directly with the plug-in provider via the button.
the plug-in provider will receive the information that you have visited the relevant page on our website only if you click on the marked field and thereby activate it.
in addition, the data specified in part 1, section 3 of this policy will be transmitted.
in the case of facebook and xing, according to these providers, the ip address is anonymised immediately after being collected in germany.
when the plug-in is activated, your personal data is therefore sent to the relevant plug-in provider and stored there (in the case of us providers, in the usa).

we have no influence on the data collected or on the data processing operations, nor do we know the full scope of the data collection, the purposes of the processing or the retention periods.
we also have no information regarding the erasure of the collected data by the plug-in providers.
the plug-in provider stores the data collected regarding you as usage profiles and uses these for advertising and market research purposes and/or for ensuring that its website is designed in accordance with requirements.
such use is carried out (including for users who are not logged in) for the purposes of displaying appropriate advertising and informing other users on the social network about your activities on our website.
you have a right to object to the creation of these user profiles.
to assert this right, you must contact the relevant plug-in provider.
via the plug-ins, we offer you the opportunity to interact with social networks and other users so that we can improve the experience we offer and make it more interesting for you as a user.
the legal basis for the use of plug-ins is art.
6(1)(1)(f) gdpr.
the data transfer takes place irrespective of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged into your account.
if you are logged into your account with the plug-in provider, your data collected on our website will be linked directly to this account.
if you click on the activated button and e.
g.
link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts.
we recommend regularly logging out after using a social network, before activating the button, as in this way you can prevent a link being made by the plug-in provider to your profile.
further information on the purpose and scope of the collection and processing of data by the plug-in provider is available in the privacy policies of these providers listed below.
in these privacy policies, you can also find further information on your associated rights and setting options for protecting your privacy.
