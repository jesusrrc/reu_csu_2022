the network's initial focus will be healthcare logistics for b2b and b2c applications.
further details will be announced in the coming months.
matternet's vision is that the city of the future will rely on a city-wide drone delivery network to fulfill urgent logistics needs for healthcare and help transition on-demand ecommerce to a sustainable mode of transport.
