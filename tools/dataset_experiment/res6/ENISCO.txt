s.
department of commerce and the european commission and swiss administration.

guidelines.
enesco has adopted the seven privacy shield principles of notice, choice, onward transfer (transfer to third parties), access, security, data integrity and enforcement with respect to personal data to be transferred to the u.
s.
from enesco operations in the eu.
notice – enesco will notify employees and customers in the eu about the purposes for which personal data will be collected and used.
information will be provided on how employees and customers can contact enesco with inquiries or complaints regarding personal data.
enesco will give notice to employees and customers regarding third parties to which it discloses the information, and restrictions that limit the information’s use and disclosure.
in certain situations, data is “anonymized” so that the names of the data subjects are not known by data processors within enesco.
in these cases, data subjects do not need to be notified.
choice – prior to releasing personal data to a third party, enesco will give an individual employee or customer the opportunity to choose whether their personal data is disclosed to that third party or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by that individual.
for sensitive data, an affirmative choice will be given to the employee or customer if the personal data is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purposes authorized subsequently by the individual.
onward transfer – (transfer to third parties) – prior to disclosing personal data to a third party, enesco will apply the notice and choice principles, enumerated above.
enesco will commit to ensuring that the third party keeper of personal data also subscribes to the privacy shield principles or any other eu adequacy finding.
enesco will also enter into a written agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of personal data protection as is maintained by enesco.
since enesco is not currently transferring personal data from the eu to third parties, no liability provisions regarding onward transfers of personal data will apply.
therefore, the provision regarding liability for the actions of agent processors may not apply.
if we change this policy in the future, we shall remain liable under the privacy shield principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
access – employees and customers covered under this policy will have access to personal information about them that enesco holds and will be able to correct, amend or delete information if it is inaccurate (the exception is when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks of the individual privacy in the case in question or the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
) you can correct, update or delete inaccuracies by contacting enesco’s director of human resources at 1-800-874-2653 prompt 3, or at .
security – enesco will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
data integrity – personal data kept by enesco will be relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used.
enesco will take reasonable steps to ensure that the data is reliable and that it is applied to its intended use.
enesco will also ensure that the information is accurate, complete and correct.
enforcement – enesco is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the federal trade commission (ftc).
in compliance with the privacy shield principles, enesco commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information.
eu individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our privacy shield policy should first contact enesco at.

commit to cooperate with the data protection authorities (dpas) of the eu countries in the investigation and resolution of complaints and will comply with any advice given by dpas.
employ a procedure for verifying that the commitment the company has made to adhere to the privacy shield principles has been implemented.
remedy issues arising out of any failure to comply with the principles.
enesco acknowledges that its failure to provide an annual self-certification to the department of commerce will remove it from its list of participants and the transfers of information will not be allowed unless enesco otherwise complies with the eu data protection directive.
disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
in addition, enesco hereby acknowledges that under certain conditions, individuals subject to this policy may have the possibility to invoke binding arbitration for any dispute related hereto.
the enesco human resources and legal departments will be the internal mechanism for ensuring compliance with the privacy shield principles and facilitating the independent recourse mechanism referenced in the “enforcement” section above.
