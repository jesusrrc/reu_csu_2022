cookie technology.
when you visit haier-related websites or use services provided by haier, we may identify you through small data files, so as to help you avoid the steps of repeatedly entering registration information, or help determine the security of your account.
these data files may be cookies, flash cookies, or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications (collectively, "cookies").
cookies are small files that store information on computers, tvs, mobile phones, or other devices.
an entity that places cookies on your device can use cookies to identify you in different websites, services, devices, and / or browsing sessions.
there are a lot of things that cookies can do.
for example.
cookies can remember your login credentials, so you don’t have to enter them every time you log in to the service.
cookies give us and third parties an idea of which parts of our services are most popular, because they help us see which pages and functions visitors visit and how long they spend on those pages.
with this information, we can improve our services more effectively and provide you with a better experience.
cookies tell us and third parties which advertisements you have watched, so that you will not receive the same advertisements every time you visit the service.

if you use a web browser to access services, you may configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when cookies are sent.

we will collect information about your browsing activities through web beacons, such as the address of pages you visit, the address of cited pages you visited previously, how long you stayed on the pages, your browsing environment and display settings.
as another example, the emails we send you may contain a clickable url that links to the content of our websites.
if you click on the link, we will track this click to help us understand your product and service preferences and improve our customer service.
a web beacon is usually a transparent image embedded in a website or email.

if you do not want your activities to be tracked in this way, you can unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time.
