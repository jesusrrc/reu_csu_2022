information you provide to us.
​.
we collect the following information.
​.
account and profile information.
we collect information about you and your company as you register for an account, create or modify your profile, make purchases through, use, access, or interact with the soloinsight services (including but not limited to when you upload, download, collaborate on or share content).
information we collect with your consent includes contact information such as name, email address, mailing address, and phone numberbilling information such as credit card details and billing addressprofile information such as a username, profile photo, and job titlepreferences information such as notification preferences.

profile information such as a username, profile photo, and job title.
profile information such as a username, profile photo, and job title.
preferences information such as notification preferences.
preferences information such as notification preferences.
you may provide this information directly when you enter it in soloinsight services.
in some cases, another user (such as a system administrator) may create an account on your behalf and may provide your information, including personal information (most commonly when your company requests that you use our products).
we collect information under the direction of our customers and often have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data we process.
if you are employed by a soloinsight customer or visiting a soloinsight customer that needs you to authenticate yourself using the service with your personally identifiable information (“pii”) to have access to their website, facility, computer, service, or a document.
the service will prompt you with a consent collection form to access your cloudgate identity wallet and share such information with the particular soloinsight customer with your consent.
in some regions where provisioned by law, the service will print or email you the consent form without revealing your pii, which you will need to physically or digitally sign in conjunction to the digital consent collection.
by using our cloudgate identity wallet you understand and agree that we are providing a secure platform for you to supply personally identifiable information (“pii”) to the service for the purpose of verifying your identity with selected parties.
this means that the service will create a one-time secure token based on blockchain technology (a “cloudgate otp token”), which you can use with our partners (such as other websites or check-in systems) to verify your identity without transmitting any pii to such partners unless you direct the service to.
other profile information that you provide (e.
g.
, 3d facial template, id photos, other phone numbers, physical addresses, a scan of your driver’s license or passport, location data, or any other information you may enter or scan as part of the service).
this information is encrypted and stored on your device or with your consent and on your secure personal cloud for high availability purposes and is not disclosed to our servers in cleartext.
when you choose to share this data with third parties, it passes through our servers only in hashed, encrypted, and digitally signed form.
the original data is thus undecipherable by soloinsight.
we further protect the pii shared with one of our customers by your consent by keeping it encrypted and provisioned to avoid unauthorized access from such customer’s employees or third-party contractors that the customer engages with.
by limiting the access to such information only to privileged admin accounts requiring multi-factor authentication and device provisioning.
​.
however, if you are an employee or visitor of one of our customers, you should always review the policies of our customers to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they collect and use your information.
if you are an employee of one of our customers and would no longer like us to process your information, please contact your employer.
if you are providing information (including personal information) about someone else, you must have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their personal information as described in this privacy policy.

we collect and store content that you create, input, submit, post, upload, transmit, store or display in the process of using our saas products or websites.
