as part of the registration process, you will need to create a password for authentication purposes, which is stored not with us but with the service provider we use to store user passwords securely and to authenticate them when you seek to use the api.

data submitted through the api (api customers & end users)—we store and process any data you chose to submit through the api in order to provide you with our api services.
we may also use that data to ensure quality, secure and improve the api (and any related software, models, and algorithms), and to detect and prevent misuse.
