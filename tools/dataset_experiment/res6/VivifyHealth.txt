it also is intended to explain the conditions under which company uses and discloses that information, and your rights in relation to that information.
changes to this privacy policy are discussed at the end of this document.
each time you use the website, however, the current version of this privacy policy will apply.
accordingly, each time you use the website you should check the date of this privacy policy (which appears at the beginning of this document) and review any changes since the last time you used the website.
the website is hosted in the united states of america and is subject to u.
s.
state and federal law.
if you are accessing our website from other jurisdictions, please be advised that you are transferring your personal information to us in the united states, and by using our website, you consent to that transfer and use of your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy.
you also agree to abide by the applicable laws of applicable states and u.
s.
federal law concerning your use of the website and your agreements with us.
any persons accessing our website from any jurisdiction with laws or regulations governing the use of the internet, including personal data collection, use and disclosure, different from those of the jurisdictions mentioned above may only use the website in a manner lawful in their jurisdiction.
if your use of the website would be unlawful in your jurisdiction, please do not use the website.
by using or accessing the website, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy.
gathering, use and disclosure of non-personally-identifying information.
users of the website generally.
“non-personally-identifying information” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person.
“personally-identifying information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person.
like most website operators, company gathers from users of the website non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available.
that information includes the user’s internet protocol (ip) address, operating system, browser type and the locations of the websites the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the website.
although such information is not personally-identifying information, it may be possible for company to determine from an ip address a user’s internet service provider and the geographic location of the visitor’s point of connectivity as well as other statistical usage data.
company analyzes non-personally-identifying information gathered from users of the website to help company better understand how the website is being used.
by identifying patterns and trends in usage, company is able to better design the website to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use.
from time to time, company may also release the non-personally-identifying information gathered from website users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the website.
web cookies.
a “web cookie” is a string of information which assigns you a unique identification that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website.
we use cookies on the website to keep track of services you have used, to record registration information regarding your login name and password, to record your user preferences, to keep you logged into the website and to facilitate purchase procedures.
company also uses web cookies to track the pages that users visit during each website session, both to help company improve users’ experiences and to help company understand how the website is being used.
as with other non-personally-identifying information gathered from users of the website, company analyzes and discloses in aggregated form information gathered using web cookies, so as to help company, its partners and others better understand how the website is being used.
company users who do not wish to have web cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse web cookies before accessing the website, with the understanding that certain features of the website may not function properly without the aid of web cookies.
website users who refuse web cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.
web beacons.
a “web beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page or email that is usually invisible to the user and allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email.
company may use web beacons on the website and in emails to count users who have visited particular pages, viewed emails and to deliver co-branded services.
web beacons are not used to access users’ personally-identifying information.
they are a technique company may use to compile aggregated statistics about website usage.
web beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a web cookie number, time and date of a page or email view and a description of the page or email on which the web beacon resides.
you may not decline web beacons.
however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all web cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a web cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or decline web cookies on an individual basis.
analytics.
we may use third-party vendors, including google, who use first-party cookies (such as the google analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the doubleclick cookie) together to inform, optimize and serve ads based on your past activity on the website, including google analytics for display advertising.
the information collected may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity.
if you do not want any information to be collected and used by google analytics, you can install an opt-out in your web browser ( and/or opt out from google analytics for display advertising or the google display network by using google’s ads settings (.
aggregated and non-personally-identifying information.
we may share aggregated and non-personally identifying information we collect under any of the above circumstances.
we may also share it with third parties and our affiliate companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on the website and on websites of third parties.
we may combine non-personally identifying information we collect with additional non-personally identifying information collected from other sources.
we also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.
for example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to the website and the most popular features or services accessed.
this information does not contain any personally-identifying information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.
mobile device additional terms.
mobile device.
if you use a mobile device to access the website or download any of our applications, we may collect device information (such as your mobile device id, model and manufacturer), operating system, version information and ip address.
geo-location information.
unless we have received your prior consent, we do not access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile application or our services, except that it may be possible for company to determine from an ip address the geographic location of your point of connectivity, in which case we may gather and use such general location data.
push notifications.
we send you push notifications if you choose to receive them, letting you know when someone has sent you a message or for other service-related matters.
if you wish to opt-out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device’s settings.
mobile analytics.
we use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone.
this software may record information, such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data and where the application was downloaded from.
we do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally-identifying information you submit within the mobile application.
social media.
we may provide you the option to connect your account on the website to your account on some social networking sites for the purpose of logging in, uploading information or enabling certain features on the website.
when logging in using your social network credentials, we may collect the personally-identifying information you have made publicly available on the social networking site, such as your name, profile picture, cover photo, username, gender, friends network, age range, locale, friend list and any other information you have made public.
once connected, other users may also be able to see information about your social network, such as the size of your network and your friends, including common friends.
by connecting your account on the website to your account on any social networking site, you hereby consent to the continuous release of information about you to us.
we will not send any of your account information to the connected social networking site without first disclosing that to you.
each social network may further allow you to set privacy controls around your information on their system, and our collection of information will always follow such controls and permissions.
this feature is subject to continuous change and improvement by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the available features and shared information are subject to change without notice to you.
we may use hyperlinks on the website which will redirect you to a social network if you click on the respective link.
however, when you click on a social plug-in, such as facebook’s “like” button, twitter’s “tweet” button or the google+, that particular social network’s plugin will be activated and your browser will directly connect to that provider’s servers.
if you do not use these buttons, none of your data will be sent to the respective social network’s plugin provider.
so for example, when you click on the facebook’s “like” button on the website, facebook will receive your ip address, the browser version and screen resolution, and the operating system of the device you have used to access the website.
settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the websites of these social networks and are not within our control.
