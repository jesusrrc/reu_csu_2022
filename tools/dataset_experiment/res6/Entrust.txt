introduction.
last updated november 19, 2020.
entrust corporation (“entrust”) values and respects your privacy.
this privacy statement together with the ‘terms of use’ of our websites and any other documents referenced here set forth entrust’s personal data practices.

these logs may record the names, usernames, manner of access, time of access and location of access of those who have visited our websites.
information third parties provide to us.
on occasion, we receive or obtain personal data from third parties.
for example, if you attend a meeting or event, the organizer of the event may share your personal data with us.
we may combine this information with information you provide to us and information we collect about you.
we will use this information and the combined information for the purposes set out below (depending on the types of information we receive).
how do we use the information we collect.
we only process personal data where we have a legal basis to do so (e.
g.
, necessary for the performance of a contract, to comply with a legal obligation, to pursue our legitimate interests or where we have consent).
here is a list of the most common uses for which we process personal data.

to provide, maintain or troubleshoot access to our websites, online products, and services.

we may disclose personal data to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft, or to protect the security of our websites, products and services.
digital advertising and analytics.
we may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“advertising providers”) that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms.
some of those ads may be personalized, meaning they are intended to be relevant to you based on information advertising providers collect about your use of our website and other sites or apps over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices.
this type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.
entrust adheres to the digital advertising alliance (“daa”) self-regulatory principles in connection with this interest-based advertising activity.
you may visit the daa webchoices tool at  to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt out of this advertising on websites by companies participating in the daa self-regulatory program.
if you delete your cookies or use a different browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choices exercised through the daa webchoices tool.
note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications.
it may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.
additionally, your browser may offer tools to limit the use of cookies or to delete cookies.
however, if you use these tools, our website may not function as intended.
we may also work with third parties that collect data about your use of our website and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes.

how long do we retain personal data.
we only retain personal data for as long as necessary for the purpose in which it was collected.
for example, where your personal data is needed to provide you with access to our websites, online products or services, we retain your personal data for the period in which we are providing that access unless we are required by law to dispose of it earlier or to keep it longer.
we also retain personal data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits, and protect or enforce our rights.
where do we keep your personal data and how do we protect it.
we use appropriate technical, organizational and administrative security measures to protect your personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
these security measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data.
for example, payment transactions are encrypted using ssl technology or have appropriate safeguards in place to ensure the security and integrity of your personal data where stored on third party servers.
where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
we ask you not to share your password with anyone.
unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our websites.
any transmission is at your own risk.
once we receive your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
international data transfers.
the personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to and/or stored at a destination on our servers or our third party servers that is different from the location where it was collected.
it may also be processed by staff who work for us or for one of our suppliers in a location different from where the data was collected.
we will only transfer your personal data as permitted by law.
certain privacy and data protection laws require data controllers to put in place safeguards to protect personal data transferred across borders.
to comply with this requirement, entrust has put in place agreements that include the standard contractual clauses recommended by the european commission to provide adequate safeguards for personal data.
who is the data controller.
the data controller of any personal data we hold about you is entrust corporation.
what rights do you have with respect to your personal data.
depending upon the applicable data protection law in your country of residency, you may have the right to ask us for information relating to personal data about you we control and process.
to correct, delete, or restrict any active processing of your personal data.
and to obtain a copy of your personal data in a structured, machine readable format.
additionally, you can object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (e.
g.
, where we don’t have to process the information to meet a legitimate interest, contractual or other legal requirement).
your right to object to processing of your personal data may be limited in certain circumstances (e.
g.
, where fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person or where you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have other compelling legitimate interests to keep such as for purposes of fraud prevention).
we may need to request additional information from you to verify your identity or understand the scope of your request, although you will not be required to create an account with us to submit a request or have it fulfilled.
if we have collected and processed your personal data with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting [email protected].
withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal data on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
we may also send you direct marketing without requiring your consent.
for example, where our marketing is not based on other lawful grounds.
note.
this will not apply to electronic marketing to canadian residents where consent is required.
