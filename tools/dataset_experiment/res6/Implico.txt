on occasion, the content we provide online may also include third-party content, for example videos from youtube, material from google maps, rss feeds, or graphics from other websites.

in other words, the ip address is required in order to display the content.
we make every effort to use only the content of providers who themselves use ip addresses exclusively to deliver content, however we have no influence over whether third-party providers store the ip address, for example for statistical purposes.
whenever we are aware of the purpose, we will disclose this to the users.
