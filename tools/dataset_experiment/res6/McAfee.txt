mcafee license agreement.
welcome to mcafee.
before you get started, we need to have a quick chat about terms.
these terms explain your legal rights and responsibilities when using our software and services.
they’re really important, so we’re going to need you to read these terms carefully, including any links, because they’ll become the agreement between you and us.
things to remember while you read this .
.
.
1.
when you see a word in bold, it will have the same meaning every time it’s used in this document.
2.
by clicking an acceptance button, installing, or using the software and services (whether provided by us or one of our partners), you’re agreeing to these terms.
if you don’t agree or follow the rules they lay out, you can’t use the software and services.
3.
when we say .
.
.
mcafee, we, our or us, this means the mcafee entity that provides the software and services in your region.
4.
when we say .
.
.
you or your, this means you or the business or company you’re authorized to represent.
5.
if you live in the us, you won’t want to miss our binding arbitration clause and the class action waiver.
they outline some very important points about how we resolve disputes.
what about my privacy.
we’re big fans of privacy protection, but we do need to know some of your personal details before you can use the software and services.
make sure to read our privacy notice so you understand how and why we collect, use, and share your personal data through our websites, products and services and how you can exercise your rights on your data.
what can i do with mcafee’s software and services.
when you purchase our software and services, you’re getting a limited license.
this means we, our partners and suppliers still own all the rights to the software and services.
we’re allowing you to use them according to these terms.
if your license is for personal use.
you get a license for the software and services you’ve subscribed to, that belongs to you, and only you.
you can’t transfer that license to anyone else.
we’re allowing you to use your license.
for as long as you continue to pay any applicable fees for your subscription or until the subscription ends.
for the length of time you chose when you made your purchase or, if you didn’t choose a subscription length, one year.
on the number of devices, for the number of users you chose when you made your purchase.
if you didn’t choose, you can only use your license on one device for one user.
if your devices and operating systems meet our requirements.
it’s up to you to make sure your devices are kept up to date and meet those requirements.
(it’s good security practice to keep your devices up to date, too.
).
if you’re using your license for small business.
you get a license for the software and services you’ve subscribed to, just like in the terms as above.
the only difference is, only people employed by the small business may use the software and services and only for internal business operations.
you must make sure to register each license you purchase, using the same email address as in your account profile.
if you purchase new licenses using that email address, we will make sure they have the same renewal date as the licenses you first purchased.
we will automatically pro-rate the cost to reflect the shorter initial term of the new licenses.
additional licenses you purchase using a different email address not associated with your account will be for the term you purchased, without a discount.
what about free software and services.
sometimes, we offer software and services free of charge, like an additional feature in a paid subscription, a pre-release, beta software or a courtesy service that may be in an experimental phase.
the terms in this agreement apply to free software and courtesy services too, unless we’ve said otherwise.
some limitations may apply, and we’ll let you know what these are when we make the free software or courtesy services available to you.
you can use free software and courtesy services for as long as we provide them to you.
what about minors.
you must comply with the law when using our software and services.
if the product you purchase includes tracking features, you may only use them to track and monitor children if you have a legal right to do so.
that means you must be a parent, legal guardian or have other legal authorization.
what can’t i do with mcafee’s software and services.
our rights as owners or licensors of the software and services are protected by law.
this means if you do something, like the following examples, your subscription will probably be canceled, and we might need to take further action.
you don’t want that.
here are some examples.

or.
continue to use the software or services after your rights to use the software or services have expired or been terminated.
technical support.
for software and services that qualify for technical support, you’ll receive the standard support offering for the length of your paid subscription.
check your receipt when you buy your software or services to see if your purchase qualifies.
our standard support offerings, policies and procedures may change from time to time and vary by country.
how do updates to mcafee software and services work.
we regularly release upgrades, enhancements and modifications to our software and services (updates).
once an update becomes available, we may stop supporting the previous version of the software or services.
to make sure you can use new features we develop, you agree to let us install updates in the background while you do other things.
we may also provide updates for free software and courtesy services, but we are not obligated to.
what happens when mcafee discontinues software, services, or features.
from time to time we may discontinue or remove certain software, services or particular features of the software or services.
when we stop offering it for purchase, download, or renewal, it reaches end of sale and you won’t be able to renew your subscription after the end of sale date.
sorry, but in order to make new and better things, sometimes we have to stop supporting older products.
we also have to make changes to features of the software and services if required by third party platforms and software that are outside of our control.
payment and automatic renewal.
if you purchased your software from mcafee and not from a third party, when you share your payment information (credit or debit card or other payment type) with us, you are authorizing us (or, our authorized partner) to charge your payment type for the initial purchase amount, as well as any subscription renewals.
updating your payment details.
if any of your payment details change (like card number or expiry date) please let us know as soon as possible so we can continue to provide the software and services when it comes time for renewal.
sometimes we may receive updated credit or debit card information from your card issuer or the card network, which we’ll use to update your payment details automatically.
we may also retry failed payments to complete transactions, including by retrying failed cards by extending expiration dates.
you consent for us to charge your payment type using the updated details.
how does automatic renewal work.
if you purchased your software from mcafee and not from a third party, your paid subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of its term, unless you’ve decided not to enroll in or have opted-out of automatic renewal.
we’ll email you in advance to let you know that your subscription is due for renewal and will charge your payment type within 30 days before the subscription is due to end.
the amount charged will be the price of the software or services at the time of renewal, which might be different to the amount you originally paid.
it is your responsibility to ensure the email address on your account is up-to-date.
if your software or services have been renamed, upgraded or replaced with a new offering we’ll provide the new offering at no more than its renewal price at the time of your renewal, provided it has reasonably comparable features.
if automatic renewal doesn’t apply in your location, we will state this at the time of purchase.
price changes.
mcafee may change the price you pay for the software or services at any time after the introductory period (if applicable) and for any of the following reasons.
legal or regulatory reasons.
improvements to the services we offer or new features.
or in response to market factors such as changes in taxes, inflation, currency fluctuations or changes in infrastructure or administrative costs.
how do i turn off automatic renewal.
if you don’t want to continue your subscription, you can turn off automatic renewal at any time by logging in to your my account page or contacting customer service.
be sure to do this more than 30 days before your subscription term expires so your payment type isn’t charged for your next renewal.
remember, if you turn off or don’t enroll in automatic renewal, you won’t be able to access premium features that we offer to subscribers of our automatic renewal service.
if you forget to turn off automatic renewal you have 60 days after you’re charged to request a refund and cancel your subscription.
our refund policy forms part of these terms and provides details on what is refundable and how to submit a request, so make sure you read them.
when does this agreement officially end.
this agreement will end when your right to access the software and services expires or is ended by us or you.
after it ends, you’re not allowed to use the software and services anymore and you must permanently delete the software and services from your devices.
can i cancel my subscription.
of course, you can, but you’ll be giving up all the online protection we provide.
if you’re absolutely sure, you can cancel your subscription any time before it’s expiry date.
check our refund policy before you cancel though, because you may not qualify for a full refund.
if you don’t qualify, the good news is you’ll be able to keep using the software and services until the end of the cancelled paid subscription period.
will my subscription be suspended or cancelled if i break the terms of this agreement.
yes.
if you violate this agreement or any of the additional terms and conditions that apply, we’ll have to suspend or end your use of the software or service.
when we end it, we may also close your account.
what happens to my data after this agreement ends.
we delete all your stored or backed-up content (information, text, files, links, images and all other materials you provide to us) in accordance with our internal policies after you have deleted or uninstalled your software.
you’re responsible for storing and backing-up your content before termination.
hard drive and cloud storage space is cheap, so don’t forget.
terms specific to certain products and services.
additional termssome of our software and services have a few extra terms of service not covered here.
you can find more information on our website.
virus removal, techmaster services or virus protection pledgewe will make every reasonable effort to remove viruses and malware from your device.
however, we can’t guarantee that all malware and viruses can be removed because some attacks are far more sophisticated than a simple scan can handle.
you can find additional information in the techmaster tos and vpp terms.
password management products and featureswe never have a copy of your master password or your encryption keys, so you’re responsible for keeping them safe.
use a strong, hard to guess master password and keep your keys in a safe place, because if you lose them, we can’t help you get back into your account.
there is no “reset password” option.
webadvisorwebadvisor uses a lot of fancy math to figure out whether or not a website is safe to browse.
as good as it is though, it can’t spot every threat or understand the nature of every website.
ratings don’t guarantee a site is completely free from risk, and good ratings don’t mean we endorse the website, or it’s services.
webadvisor’s “secure search” is powered by yahoo.
, by default.
if you turn secure search on, your searches will go through the yahoo.
network.
you can change your browser’s default search engine options in your browser’s settings.
home scanner feature if you’ve purchased this feature, you’ll need to opt-in for it to work.
by turning home scanner on, you’re giving us permission to identify devices that connect to your home wi-fi network.
this helps us spot devices that have poor security and could put your safety at risk.
you can opt out of home scanner at any time.
home scan is just for your home wi-fi network.
home scan collects data from every device on your network, so be sure to let your friends and family know their devices will be scanned before you give them your wi-fi password.
antivirus protectionyour antivirus protection may include features that monitor the security status of your device, automatically sending us reports about suspected malware and other unwanted software.
this automatic reporting helps us quickly detect and respond to new threats, providing better protection for your device.
the reports may include files that contain suspected malware.
these types of files are unlikely to contain any of your personal data, but if we think a suspicious file is likely to contain your personal data, we will seek your permission to send the file.
you can turn off this automatic reporting from your antivirus protection in your product.
vpn (virtual private network)if you’ve purchased this feature, you must comply with our fair use policy.
this means, when using mcafee’s vpn, you must not do anything that imposes or may impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure.

identity protectionif you are entitled to our identity protection features, please see our identity protection terms of service, which form part of this agreement.
identity monitoring (dark web monitoring) the dark web can be a scary place.
it’s basically just the internet, but an encrypted version, so it’s harder to find out who owns websites.
because of this, people buy and sell all kinds of information, like credit card numbers and identification.
our identity monitoring service searches dark web data available to us and alerts you if the personal data you have chosen to monitor has been found on the dark web.
by using the service, you understand and agree to the following additional terms.
we cannot remove your breached information from the dark web.
it is your responsibility to keep your contact information up to date, review the alerts and take any recommended actions to reduce the risk of further misuse of your data.

we provide you alerts based on the dark web data available to us.
we do not guarantee the accuracy of information we provide you.
we can only monitor the information that you have chosen to provide us for monitoring.

you must be over the age of 16 to use our dark web monitoring service.
you may only provide your own personal data for monitoring.
you must not provide the personal data of any other person.
we will not be liable to any third person if you provide their data in breach of this restriction.
you must not use our dark web monitoring service to obtain someone else’s information without their consent.
personal data cleanupif you are entitled to the personal data cleanup feature, we will scan a list of data broker sites to see if they have your personal information and help you take steps to raise deletion requests.
it’s important to note, however, that not all data brokers are located in a jurisdiction in which privacy regulations have been adopted.
while some data brokers may comply with your deletion requests, it is possible that others might tell you they are not required by law to do so.
depending on your subscription, you may be entitled to ask us to help you raise deletion requests.
when we help you send these requests, we do not act as an agent on your behalf.
sms and text messagingif you choose to provide us your phone number, we may use it to register your mcafee subscription and/or send you service notifications and reminders.
message and data rates may apply.
you can opt out of receiving our sms and text messages by following the instructions you received in the message or at the time you provided your phone number (typically by replying “stop”).

this includes claims made by us, by you, on your behalf or by persons connected with you or us, such as employees, subsidiaries and successors.
you and we agree that no class action or other collective, consolidated, or representative action may be asserted by arbitration, court or otherwise.
all claims, whether in arbitration or otherwise, must be brought solely in your or mcafee’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or collective proceeding.
we and you waive the right to initiate or participate in a class action or litigate a claim in court before a judge or jury.
notice of dispute before initiating arbitration, a party must give the other party 60 days’ advance written notice.
notices to us should be addressed.
mcafee, 5000 headquarters drive, plano, tx 75024, attention.
legal department.
the notice must include your name, address, and contact information, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested.
you and we must use reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the notice of dispute is sent.
after 60 days, either party may commence arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.
these notice obligations do not modify the statute of limitations applicable to any claim.
administration of arbitration.
there will be a single, neutral arbitrator, who will be either a lawyer admitted to practice in the relevant jurisdiction with at least 10 years’ experience, or a retired judge selected in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association (aaa), who will be bound by the terms of this agreement.
the arbitration rules (commercial arbitration rules or consumer arbitration rules of the aaa), as modified by this agreement will apply.
all arbitration proceedings will be conducted in english.
except for claims or counter-claims seeking less than us$25,000, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based and the award will be confidential and only disclosed as is necessary to obtain judgment or as otherwise required by law.
costs  the filing fee is payable by whoever initiates the arbitration.
if an award is made in your favor we will reimburse you the filing fee if paid by you.
we may reimburse or advance you the filing fee or other expenses if we are satisfied there is good reason to do so (e.
g.
you cannot afford the fees).
the arbitration rules will apply in respect of all other fees and expenses and each party will bear its own legal costs and expenses, unless the arbitrator determines otherwise.
small claims court option  if you are an individual consumer, you may choose to resolve your claim in small claims court in your county of residence or in santa clara county, california if you meet the court’s requirements.
preservation of provisional remedies  despite this arbitration clause, we will still be free to resort to self-help remedies or seek injunctive relief, attachment or garnishment orders at any time.
conflicting terms  this arbitration agreement will prevail over any conflicting terms in the arbitration rules or any other applicable arbitration terms.
if any part of this arbitration agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable it will not invalidate the other provisions of the arbitration agreement.
provided, however, that (a) if the prohibition on class-wide arbitration is deemed invalid, then this entire arbitration agreement will be null and void.
and (b) if the prohibition on arbitration of representative claims brought in a private attorney general capacity is deemed invalid, then the arbitration agreement will be null and void as to such claims only.
waiver of jury trial  if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and we agree that there will not be a jury trial.
you and we unconditionally waive any right to trial by jury in any dispute that in any way relates to or arises out of the agreement or from any software or services.
in the event of litigation, this paragraph may be filed to show a written consent to a trial by the court.

you assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the platform, home network, and app.

for example, there are viruses and other malware that.
(i) delete or destroy your data (sometimes individual files, but sometimes even an entire disk by corrupting a master boot record or other key element).
(ii) modify your files (such as parasitic malware that attaches itself to a file and modifies the file to enable its own execution and/or propagation).
and (iii) encrypt files on your drive (such as ransomware that uses asymmetric encryption).
the best way for you to protect yourself from these types of attacks is frequent back-ups of your data to another device/location.
that way, you have another copy of the data in the event that the attacking software has deleted, modified, or destroyed the data.
it is your sole and exclusive responsibility to back-up all data and files on your device so that they can be restored in the event of an attack on your data.
without such a back-up, it may not be possible to restore the deleted/destroyed/modified data.
mcafee is not liable for loss of or recovery of data, or for files or loss of use of systems or networks arising from attacks on data.

in no event will our, our affiliates’ or our suppliers’, licensors’ or other third-party service providers’ aggregate liability to you for direct damages under these terms exceed the greater of (i) the price you paid for the platform service, or (ii) if you have not paid mcafee for the use of any services, $100.

administration of arbitration.
if any dispute is not resolved by informal negotiation, any claim, dispute, or controversy will be, at the demand of either party, conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the federal arbitration act (“faa”), and not state law.
you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate as a party or class member in) all disputes in court before a judge or jury.
instead, all disputes will be resolved on an individual basis before a single, neutral arbitrator and the proceeding shall be confidential.
the arbitrator will be either a lawyer admitted to practice law in his or her jurisdiction and with at least ten years’ experience, or a retired or former judge selected in accordance with the rules of the aaa.
the arbitrator is bound by the terms of this agreement, and the arbitration shall be governed by the commercial arbitration rules and supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the aaa, as modified by this agreement (the “arbitration rules”).
for more information, see adr.
org or call 1-800-778-7879.
all arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in english, and the united states faa shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the binding arbitration clause in these terms.
the award shall be confidential and only disclosed as is necessary to obtain judgment or as otherwise required by law.
you and we further agree that a judgment may be entered upon the award by any court having jurisdiction.
the arbitration award shall determine the rights and obligations between the named parties only, and only in respect of the claims in arbitration, and shall not have any bearing on the rights and obligations of any other dispute.
costs.
the party initiating the arbitration shall pay the initial filing fee.
if you file the arbitration and an award is rendered in your favor, we will reimburse your filing fee.
we will pay the fees and costs for the first day of any hearing.
all other fees and costs will be allocated in accordance with the arbitration rules.
however, we will advance or reimburse filing and other fees if the arbitrator rules that you cannot afford to pay them or if you ask us and we determine there is a good reason for doing so.
each party shall bear the expense of their respective attorneys, experts, witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of who prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.
right to resort to provisional remedies preserved.
nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or constrain our right to resort to self-help remedies or to comply with legal process, or to obtain provisional remedies such as injunctive relief, attachment, or garnishment by a court having appropriate jurisdiction.
provided, however, that you or we may elect to arbitrate any dispute related to such provisional remedies.
conflicting terms.
in the event of a conflict between the arbitration rules and this arbitration agreement, this arbitration agreement shall govern.
if any portion of this arbitration agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall not invalidate the other provisions of the arbitration agreement, provided, however, that (a) if the prohibition on classwide arbitration is deemed invalid, then this entire arbitration agreement shall be null and void.
and (b) if the prohibition on arbitration of representative claims brought in a private attorney general capacity is deemed invalid, then the arbitration agreement shall be null and void as to such claims only.
this arbitration agreement shall survive the termination or cancellation of these terms.
in the event of a conflict between this arbitration agreement and any other applicable arbitration provision, this arbitration agreement shall control.
waiver of jury trial.
if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and mcafee agree that there will not be a jury trial.
you and mcafee unconditionally waive any right to trial by jury in any dispute that in any way relates to or arises out of these terms or from any services you receive from us (or from any advertising for any such services).
in the event of litigation, this paragraph may be filed to show a written consent to a trial by the court.

by adding a funding source to your account, you agree that we are authorized to charge that funding source in accordance with these terms of service.

merchants may charge your safe cards when you are off-line, such as when a merchant bills you for a periodic subscription to their products and services.
you agree to us storing a payment token corresponding to each of your funding sources for these transactions.
a merchant may split your purchase into multiple transactions, such as when items are available, dispatched or shipped at different times.
in these cases which result in multiple charges to your safe cards, there will be a corresponding number of charges to your funding source, each incorporating the fee as described at the beginning of this section.
a merchant may charge your safe cards for more than the original purchase amount, such as when you change your order after it is placed, update your shipping address, or add a tip or gratuity.
in these cases, we will charge your funding source for the full amount charged to your safe card plus the fee as described at the beginning of this section.
transactions on your funding source will be prefixed with “mcfe” and contain additional information identifying the safe card the transaction relates to.
as a privacy measure, the name of the merchant with which you used the safe card does not appear in the transaction description on your funding source.
transactions visible in the safe card dashboard serve as your confirmation of a transaction with a merchant.
this includes authorizations, debits, and refunds.
you are solely responsible for preserving this information in a way that meets your requirements and responsibilities under the law.
if a transaction is partially or fully refunded, the money will be refunded to your funding source that was associated with your safe card at the time the transaction was made.
refunds normally take 7-10 business days.
transaction fees are non-refundable even if the transaction is cancelled.
this is because we incur a non-refundable fee from our payment processor for each transaction.

you are limited to 5 active safe cards at any time.
your daily transaction limit (across all your safe cards) is $250.
