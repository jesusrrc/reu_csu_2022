personal information also does not include information that has been anonymized or aggregated in such a way that there is no serious possibility it can be used to identify an individual, whether on its own or in combination with other information.
your consent to collection, use and disclosure.
we collect, use and disclose your personal information with your consent or as permitted or required by law.
how we obtain your consent (i.
