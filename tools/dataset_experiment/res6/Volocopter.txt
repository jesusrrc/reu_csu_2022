general retrievable data / log files.
for technical reasons, every time a website is accessed, data is transmitted from your computer to us, such as the date and time of you visiting one of our pages, your browser type, the browser settings and the operating system, the last page you visited, the amount of data transmitted and the access status (file transfer, file not found etc.
).
this data is considered to be regular non-personal data.
in addition, however, your computer usually also sends us your ip address, which in individual cases may be personal.
we use the log file data solely to ensure the functionality of our services (such as failure analysis, system security, and protection against misuse).
cookies.
to make visiting of our website easier, we transfer so-called cookies to your computer.
cookies are small text files that can be used to identify your computer.
they do not interfere with the operating system of your computer.
among other things, we use cookies to measure and control the frequency of page views and general site navigation.
you can block the use of cookies.
under certain circumstances, however, individual functions of our offer might not be used.
to block the use of cookies, please also refer to the instructions for your browser software.
details of your ip address.
your ip address, which in many cases is sent to us, is a globally valid identifier of your computer that is unique at the time of assignment by your internet service provider.
an ip address consists of four numbered blocks separated by dots.
in most cases, you as a private user will not use a consistent ip address, since you will only be assigned this temporarily by your provider (so-called „dynamic ip address“).
your provider can sort out which ip address was assigned to which of its clients at what time.
for other people, including us, the recording of assignment of a dynamic ip address to a specific person is usually not possible.
this is different only in the case of a permanently assigned ip address (so-called „static ip address“), which in principle makes possible a clear assignment of the user data via this feature.
except for the purpose of tracking unauthorized access to our offer on the internet, we generally consider this data to be non-personal, but evaluate it only on an anonymous basis, to detect which of our sites are favoured, how many accesses are made daily and the like.
statistics assessment tools.
for individual services of our enterprise we collect additional data.
these are partially used for statistical purposes.
for example, it shows how often our pages are accessed so we can graph out the basics for our media data.
