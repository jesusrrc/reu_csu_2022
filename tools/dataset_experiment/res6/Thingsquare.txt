thingsquare privacy policy.
thingsquare ab operates a number of internet and web based          services.
when using any of them, we may collect certain          personal information from you.
this policy attempts to          explain what information and how we take care of that          information.
website visitors.
when you visit any of our publicly available websites, we          generally collect information that your browser provides our          web server.
this data is aggregated with information from          other visitors to help us understand how to improve our          products and services.
we may also make information that is          anonymous and aggregated (such as monthly visitors)          available to third parties or publish it online.
registered users.
if you register for any our services, we collect such          information that makes it possible for us to deliver the          services, store preferences and settings, manage security          and, when applicable, collect payment.
this information may          include your name, address, organization and email          address.
you may always refuse to divulge such information,          considering that this may prevent you from using certain          features.
how we protect your information.
we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable          information to anyone.
in order to deliver our products and          services, we may share personally identifiable information          with our employees, subcontractors and service providers, on          a strict need-to-know basis.
this also means that          information may be stored outside your home country.
we may          also share your information after a legal request (such as a          subpoena) from the legal authorities we are subject to.
if you want to delete your data.
according to 26 § personuppgiftslagen (1998.
204) you may,          free of charge, once every calendar year, by a written,          undersigned request addressed to us, receive information          about what personal information of yours that we have          collected and how they are used.
you may also request that          we correct your personal information.
cookies.
a cookie is a string of information that a website stores on          a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser          provides to the website each time the visitor          returns.
thingsquare uses cookies to help thingsquare          identify and track visitors, their usage of thingsquare          websites, and their website access preferences.
thingsquare          visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their          computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before          using thingsquare’s websites, with the drawback that certain          features of thingsquare’s websites may not function properly          without the aid of cookies.
business transfers.
if thingsquare, or substantially all of its assets, were          acquired, or in the unlikely event that thingsquare goes out          of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be          one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third          party.
you acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and          that any acquirer of thingsquare may continue to use your          personal information as set forth in this policy.
how changes to this policy are communicated.
the current version of this policy is always available from our          website.
our registered users who have provided a valid email address          will be notified about any changes through email.
