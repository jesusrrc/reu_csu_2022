what are cookies.
a cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can recognize you when you revisit and remember certain information about you.
this can include which pages you have visited, choices you have made from menus, any specific information you have entered into forms and the time and date of your visit.
2.
types of cookies.
there are two main types of cookies.
•	session cookies.
these are temporary cookies that expire at the end of a browser session.
that is, when you leave the site.
session cookies allow the website to recognize you as you navigate between pages during a single browser session and allow you to use the website most efficiently.
for example, session cookies enable a website to remember that a user has placed items in an online shopping basket.
•	persistent cookies.
in contrast to session cookies, persistent cookies are stored on your equipment between browsing sessions until expiry or deletion.
they therefore enable the website to “recognize” you on your return remember your preferences and tailor services to you.
in addition to session cookies and persistent cookies, there may be other cookies which are set by a website which you have chosen to visit, such as this website, in order to provide us or third parties with information.
3.

•	help us recognize you as a unique user when you return to our website so that you do not have to input your details multiple times as you move between our pages or services.
•	remember how you have customized your use of this site, such as your preferred currency and time zone.
•	collect and compile anonymous, aggregated information for statistical and evaluation purposes to help us understand how users use the website and help us improve the structure of our website.
many cookies are designed to give you optimal usage of the web.
for example, we use cookies to enable you to improve your user experience when using our website, e.
g.
a cookie which recognizes if your browser supports specific technology features.
this helps, for example, in enabling web pages to be loaded more quickly when you request the download of a large file.
in addition to cookies which send information to us, we also use cookies which collect information and send it to third-parties.
an example of this is google analytics.
google has developed the google analytics opt-out browser add-on for the google analytics javascript (ga.
js, analytics.
js, dc.
js).
if you want to opt out of google analytics, you can download and install the add-on for your web browser here.

as with first party cookies, you are able to block third party cookies through your browser settings.
some of our cookies may collect and store your personal information, such as your name or email address.
we are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy and will ensure that all personal information collected by us is kept and treated in accordance with our privacy policy.
