we describe how tracking works on our website in section 13.
show more.
behavioral data is information about certain actions, including your response to electronic communications or your location.
for example, we may collect your location data when you use our website.
preference data tells us what your needs are.
we obtain this information from the analysis of existing data, such as behavioral data, so that we can generally improve our offers.
to improve the quality of our analyses, we may combine this data with other data that we also obtain from third parties, such as our contractual partners.
other datawe also collect data from or about you in other situations.
for example, data that may relate to you (such as files, evidence, etc.
) is processed in relation with administrative or judicial proceedings.
we may also collect data for health protection (for example as part of health protection concepts).
we may obtain or create photos, videos and sound recordings in which you may be identifiable (for example with security cameras, etc.
).
we may also collect data about who enters certain buildings, and when or who has access rights (including in relation with access controls, based on registration data, etc.
) and who uses our infrastructure and systems and when.
moreover, we collect and process data about our shareholders and other investors, in addition to marketing and promotional data, including information for registers, in relation with the exercise of their rights and with events (for example general meetings).
the retention period for this data depends on the processing purpose and is limited to what is necessary.
this ranges from a few days for many of the security cameras, to usually a few weeks in case of data for contact tracing and visitor data that is usually kept for 3 months, to several years or longer for reports about events with images.
data relating to you as a shareholder or investor is kept in accordance with corporate law, but in any case, for as long as you are invested.
some of the data set out in this section 3 is provided to us by you (through forms, in relation with communication with us, in relation with contracts, when you use the website, etc.
).
we provide certain services to you only if you provide us with registration data, because we or our contractual partners wish to know who uses our services, because it is a technical requirement or because we wish to communicate with you.
however, you are not required to disclose data to us except in individual cases.
for example, you generally have the option of declining or not giving consent to collect behavioral and preference data.
show more.
we provide certain services to you only if you provide us with registration data, because we or our contractual partners wish to know who uses our services, because it is a technical requirement or because we wish to communicate with you.
if you or the person you represent (for example your employer) wishes to enter into or perform a contract with us, we must collect master data, contract data and communication data from you, and we process technical data if you wish to use our website for this purpose.
if you do not provide us with the data necessary for the conclusion and performance of the contract, you should expect that we may refuse to conclude the contract, that you may commit a breach of contract or that we will not perform the contract.
similarly, we can only submit a response to a request from you if we process communication data and – if you communicate with us online – possibly also technical data.
also, the use of our website is not possible without us receiving technical data.
show more.
5.
for what purposes do we process your data.
we process your data for the purposes explained below.
further information is set out in section 13 for online services.
these purposes and their objectives represent interests of us and potentially of third parties.
you can find further information on the legal basis of our processing in section 6.
show more.
6.
on what basis do we process your data.
where we ask for your consent for certain processing activities (for example for marketing mailings and for advertising management and behavior analysis on the website), we will inform you separately about the relevant processing purposes.
you may withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future by providing us written notice (by mail) or, unless otherwise noted or agreed, by sending an e-mail to us.
see our contact details in section 2.
for withdrawing consent for online tracking, see section 13.
where you have a user account, you may also withdraw consent or contact us also through the website.
once we have received notification of withdrawal of consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) you consented to, unless we have another legal basis to do so.
withdrawal of consent does not, however, affect the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent prior to withdrawal.
where we do not ask for consent for processing, the processing of your personal data relies on the requirement of the processing for initiating or performing a contract with you (or the entity you represent) or on our or a third-party legitimate interest in the particular processing, in particular in pursuing the purposes and objectives set out in section 5 and in implementing related measures.
this also includes compliance with legal regulations, where compliance is not recognized as a legal basis by applicable data protection law (for example in the case of the gdpr, the laws in the eea and in the case of the dpa, swiss law).
this also includes the marketing of our services, the interest in better understanding our markets and in managing and further developing our company, including its operations, safely and efficiently.
in particular, in the case of cybercrime watchlist™, personal data is processed on the basis of the legitimate interest of victims of cybercrime and financial institutions to prevent damage and criminal activities.
in the case of cybercrime complaint™, the legal basis is the performance of a contract for the reporting person.
the reporting person may rely on consent, legitimate interest and applicable local law permitting individuals to file criminal complaints involving personal data of the individuals accused.
where we receive sensitive personal data (for example biometric data for identification purposes), we may process your data on other legal basis, for example, in the event of a dispute, as required in relation with a potential litigation or for the enforcement or defense of legal claims.
in some cases, other legal basis may apply, which we will communicate to you separately as necessary.
7.
what applies in case of profiling and automated individual decisions.
we may automatically evaluate personal aspects relating to you («profiling») based on your data (section 4) for the purposes set out in section 5, where we wish to determine preference data, but also in order to detect misuse and security risks, to perform statistical analysis or for operational planning.
we may also create profiles for these purposes, i.
e.
we may combine behavioral and preference data, but also master data, contract data and technical data relating to you in order to better understand you as a person with your various interests and other characteristics.
show more.
if you are our customer, we may, for example, use «profiling» to determine, for your own protection, the likelihood of a particular transaction being fraudulent.
this allows us to suspend the transaction for further clarification.
«profiles» are to be distinguished from «profiling».
«profiles» refers to the combining of different data in order to draw conclusions on essential aspects of your personality (for example what you like, how you behave in certain situations, e.
g.
, when you are looking for a specific information on our website) from the totality of this data.
profiles may also be used for marketing, for example, or for security purposes.
in both cases, we pay attention to the proportionality and reliability of the results and take measures against misuse of these profiles or profiling.
where these can produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you, we generally ensure human review.
8.
with whom do we share your data.
in order to operate the website, provide the services, and comply with our legal obligations (including under our contracts), otherwise protect our legitimate interests, or carry out the other purposes set out in section 5, we may disclose your personal data to third parties, including the following categories of recipients.

show more.

13.
do we use online tracking.
we use various techniques on our website that allow us, and third parties engaged by us to recognize you during your use of our website, and possibly to track you across several visits.
this section informs you about this.
in essence, we wish to distinguish access by you (through your system) from access by other users, so that we can ensure the functionality of the website and carry out analysis and personalization.
the services are designed in such a way that you are recognized as an individual visitor each time you access the website, for example by our server (or third-party servers ) that assign a specific identification number to you or your browser (so-called “cookie”).
show more.
cookies are individual codes (for example a serial number) that our server or a server of our service providers or advertising partners transmits to your system when you connect to our website, and that your system (browser, cell phone) accepts and stores until the set expiration time.
your system transmits these codes to our server or the third-party server with each additional access.
that way, you are recognized even if your identity is unknown.
we use these technologies on our website and may allow certain third parties to do so as well.
you can also set your browser to block or deceive certain types of cookies or alternative technologies, or to delete existing cookies.
you can also add software to your browser that blocks certain third-party tracking.
you can find more information on the help pages of your browser (usually with the keyword “privacy”) or on the websites of the third parties set out below.
we distinguish the following categories of «cookies» (including other technologies).
necessary cookies.
some cookies are necessary for the functioning of the website or for certain features.
for example, they ensure that you can move between pages without losing information that was entered in a form.
they also ensure that you stay logged in.
these cookies exist temporarily only (“session cookies”).
if you block them, the website may not work properly.
other cookies are necessary for the server to store options or information (which you have entered) beyond a session (i.
e.
a visit to the website) if you use this function (for example language settings, consents, automatic login functionality, etc.
).
these cookies have an expiration date of up to 24 months.
performance cookies.
in order to optimize our website and related offers and to better adapt them to the needs of the users, we use cookies to record and analyze the use of our website, potentially beyond one session.
we use third-party analytics services for this purpose.
we have listed them below.
before we use such cookies, we ask for your consent.
you can withdraw consent at any time by contacting us.
performance cookies also have an expiration date of up to 24 months.
details can be found on the websites of the third-party providers.
we may also integrate additional third-party offers on our website, in particular from social media providers.
these offers are deactivated by default.
as soon as you activate them (for example by clicking a button), their providers can determine that you are using our website.
if you have an account with the provider, it can assign this information to you and thereby track your use of online offers.
the providers process this data as separate controllers.
show more.
we currently use offers from the following service providers and advertising partners (where they use data from you, or cookies set on your computer for advertising purposes).
google analytics.
google llc is the provider of the service “google analytics.
” for the purposes of the eu general data protection regulation (“gdpr”) and the swiss data protection act (“dpa”).
, google ireland ltd.
is the controller (together with google analytics, “google”).
google tracks the behavior of visitors to our website(duration, page views, geographic region of access, etc.
) through performance cookies (see above) and on this basis creates reports for us about the use of our website.
we have configured the service so that the ip addresses of visitors are truncated by google in europe before forwarding them to the united states and then cannot be traced back.
google provides us with reports and may therefore be considered our processor, but it also processes data for its own purposes.
google may be able to draw conclusions about the identity of visitors based on the data collected, create personal profiles and link this data with the google accounts of these individuals.
you should assume that this processing takes place if you consent to the use of performance cookies.
information about data protection with google analytics can be found here and if you have a google account, you can find more details about google’s processing here.
