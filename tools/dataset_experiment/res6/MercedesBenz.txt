” in this privacy statement, “we,” “us,” and “our,” refer collectively to mbusa.
this privacy statement does not address our connected vehicle services privacy practices.
our connected vehicle services privacy practices are addressed in our connected vehicle services section.
specific or additional privacy information may apply to our mobile device applications, and such information can be found in our mobile applications section or within the information section of the applications.
the mbusa platform is targeted to individuals in the united states and puerto rico.
if you access the mbusa platform from other regions, be aware that the privacy practices of mbusa may differ from those of your home country.
by interacting with the mbusa platform, you are accepting the terms of this privacy statement.

information you provide to us.
some features of the mbusa platform ask you to provide us with specific categories of information in order to enjoy complete functionality.
if you do not provide us with the categories of information requested, your ability to fully interact with the mbusa platform may be limited.
the features requiring you to provide information to mbusa are described in detail below.
inquiries.
in order to submit inquiries through the mbusa platform, you must provide certain information.
the “contact a dealership,” “schedule a test drive,” and “request a quote,” forms require you to provide your name and email address.
this information is required so that you can be contacted about your request.
some mbusa platform forms also require you to provide us with your geographic region or zip code so that we can direct your request appropriately.
the “apply for financing” form requires you to provide your name, address, date of birth, phone number, email address, social security number, and employment information.
