ii.
how personal data is shared and transferred.
personal data shared with third parties.
we may disclose your personal data to third parties who provide us with various business services (for example, monitoring and maintaining our websites and internal business applications, preparing newsletters and mailings, payroll processing).
these service providers and contractors are restricted from using this data in any way other than to provide services for us and subject to our documented instructions only.
we may also partner with other companies to provide you with products, services, or content on a joint or 'co-branded' basis.
if we offer co-branded products, services or content, you may see both our logo and the logo of the co-branded partner.
to access or use co-branded products services, or content, you may have to provide certain requested information which may be shared with our co-branded partners.
you should read the individual privacy policies and terms of use of our co-branded partners, as these may differ in some respects from this privacy notice.
remember, you can always opt-out of sharing your personal data with a co-branded partner by choosing not to use the product, service or content provided.
we may also share your personal data with other affiliates within our group of companies (for example, for internal administrative purposes or where a vertex affiliate supports a particular vertex business function), in compliance with applicable laws.
in addition, we may disclose your personal data to third parties in special cases, including when we have a reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring a legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with our rights and property or those of any other person.
we may also disclose your personal data when we believe the law requires it and in any situation that involves threats to any person's physical safety.

international transfers of personal data.
in some instances, the service providers, business partners, vertex affiliates and others that we share personal data with are located in other countries.
the level of protection for your personal data in these other countries may not be the same as the level of protection in your country.
in these cases, we protect any information transferred to third countries using appropriate safeguards, such as contractual clauses approved by relevant supervisory authorities (where applicable).
for example, if you reside in europe or your personal data is otherwise subject to european law, all vertex affiliates that access or receive your personal data are subject to data protection contracts approved by the european commission and that impose on such affiliates a level of protection for your personal data equivalent to european data protection requirements.
in any event, we only share personal data with vertex affiliates and third parties performing services on our behalf if such affiliates and third parties provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that the processing they conduct will meet the requirements of applicable law and ensure the protection of your privacy.
