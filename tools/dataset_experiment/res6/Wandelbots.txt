our approach to data protection.
data protection law is part of our personal rights.
especially in our constantly developing and networked world, the importance of these rights should not be underestimated.
wandelbots gmbh attaches great importance to data protection law in all its forms and requirements.
the processing of your personal data, for example your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number, is always carried out in accordance with the basic data protection regulation and in compliance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to us.
we would like to inform you and also the public about the type, scope and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process in a comprehensible manner so that comprehensive clarification on the subject of data protection is provided.
below you will therefore find comprehensive information on how we process personal data.
1.

2.
for what purposes and on what legal basis we process data.
a.
general data processing when visiting the website.
our website collects a series of general data and information from you each time you visit the website.
this general data and information is stored in the server’s log files.
the following can be recorded.
(1) browser types and versions used,(2) the operating system used by the accessing system,(3) the website from which an accessing system arrives at our website (so-called referrer),(4) the date and time of an access to the website,(5) an internet protocol address (ip address),(6) the internet service provider of the accessing system.
when using this general data and information, our company does not draw any conclusions about you.
rather, this information is required in order to(1) deliver the contents of our website correctly,(2) optimise the contents of our website,(3) ensure the long-term functionality of our information technology systems and the technology of our website, and(4) to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for prosecution in the event of a cyber attack.
therefore, the data and information collected is, on the one hand, statistically evaluated by us and, on the other hand, it is analysed with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise so as to ultimately ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.
the data of the server log files are stored separately from other personal data.
the legal basis for this is art.
6 (1) f) dsgvo.
our legitimate interest lies both in error-free delivery of the website, the ongoing optimisation of website performance and the security of our it systems.
b.
registration for the wandelbots license management application (“walima”).
as our customer or one of our partners, you have the opportunity to register for a walima account.
the portal provides you with comprehensive options to manage and customise our products and services and to send us messages.
the data processing in each case serves to fulfil and adapt our customer and partner contracts on the basis of art.
6 para.
1 b) dsgvo.
insofar as you use the functions of the portal to create your own users with your own rights, the processing of this data is your own responsibility.
we will not use this user data created by you for our own purposes beyond the fulfilment of our existing contracts with you.
c.
contact options via the website and by e-mail.
if you contact us by e-mail or via the form provided on our website, the personal data you provide will be automatically stored.
such personal data transmitted to us by you on a voluntary basis will be stored for the purpose of processing your enquiry and contacting you.
the legal basis for this is art.
6 (1) b) dsgvo or, insofar as it is not an enquiry which is also directed towards the conclusion of a future contract, art.
6 (1) a) dsgvo.
if you send us an enquiry for a specific offer or about our products via our contact form, we will send you information about our products and developments for an appropriate period of time on the basis of our legitimate interests pursuant to art.
6 (1) f) dsgvo.
if you send us an unspecified enquiry via our contact form, we will ask you by e-mail whether you are interested in receiving information about our products and developments for a reasonable period of time.
processing will then only take place with your consent in accordance with art.
6 para.
1 a) dsgvo.
for the administration of incoming requests, we use the nutshell service of nutshell, inc.
which we have engaged as a processor.
you can find more information about nutshell below in the overview of our service providers (data collection by third parties and data transfer to third parties).
d.
order our newsletter.
on our website you can subscribe to our company newsletter.
in addition to providing your email address, which is mandatory for sending the newsletter, we also collect your first and last name.
the legal basis for this is art.
6 para.
1 a) dsgvo and for the first name and surname art.
6 para.
1 f) dsgvo.
our legitimate interest lies in the desire to address our subscribers personally.
in order to send our newsletter, we use the “hubspot” service, provided by hubspot inc.
,.
further information on this can be found below in the overview of our service providers (data collection by third parties and data transfer to third parties).
we inform all subscribers at regular intervals by means of a newsletter about offers and innovations of our company.
for legal reasons, a confirmation email is sent to the email address entered for the first time for the newsletter dispatch using the double opt-in procedure.
this confirmation email is used to check whether the person authorised to access the email address has authorised receipt of the newsletter.
when registering for the newsletter, we also store the ip address assigned by the internet service provider (isp) at the time of registration, the computer system used and the date and time of registration.
the collection of this data is necessary in order to be able to trace a (possible) misuse of your e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves our legal protection.
you can cancel your subscription to our newsletter at any time and revoke your consent to the storage of your personal data, which you have given us for the newsletter dispatch, at any time.
for the purpose of cancelling the newsletter subscription or revoking your consent, you will find a corresponding link in each newsletter.
alternatively, you can also contact us directly.
our newsletters contain so-called tracking pixels.
a tracking pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded in emails to enable log file recording and log file analysis.
this enables a statistical evaluation of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns.
by means of the embedded tracking pixel, we can see whether and when the newsletter was opened and which links were called up by you from the newsletter.
such personal data collected via the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and evaluated by us in order to optimise the newsletter dispatch and to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the subscribers.
this personal data will not be passed on to third parties.
you are entitled at any time to revoke the separate declaration of consent given in this regard via the double opt-in procedure.
the processing of the analysis data is based on art.
6 para.
1 f) dsgvo.
our legitimate interests lie in analysing the usage habits of our subscribers and improving our advertising efforts.
e.
our blog – your comments.
we offer you a blog on our website where, in addition to the latest information, you have the opportunity to leave individual comments on individual blog posts.
a blog is a portal on a website, usually publicly visible, in which one or more persons, called bloggers or web bloggers, can post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blogposts.
the entries can usually be commented on by third parties.
if you leave a comment on our blog, in addition to the comments you leave, details of when you entered the comment and the user name (pseudonym) you chose will be stored and published.
we must reserve the right to check the content of your comment before publishing it.
furthermore, the ip address assigned by your internet service provider (isp) is also logged.
this storage of the ip address is done for security reasons and in case you violate the rights of third parties by posting a comment or post illegal content (insults, forbidden political propaganda, etc.
).
the storage of this personal data is therefore in our own interest (art.
6 para.
1 lit.
f.
dsgvo), so that we can defend ourselves if necessary in the event of an infringement.
the personal data collected will not be passed on to third parties, unless such a transfer is required by law or serves our legal defence.
furthermore, we will use the mandatory e-mail address to prevent spam postings and also to send you notifications when someone has replied to your comment.
the legal basis for this is in each case art.
6 para.
1 lit.
f.
dsgvo.
our legitimate interest lies on the one hand in keeping the comments free of spam and on the other hand in improving communication about our contributions.

we will therefore collect and process personal data from potential interested parties and their contact persons both ourselves and via the service providers we use within the scope of our legitimate interests and on the basis of art.
6 (1) f) dsgvo.
our interest here lies in expanding our customer base.
the same applies to the processing of data of former customers and their contact persons, whom we would like to encourage through our continued advertising activities to purchase our products and use our services again in the future.
further information on the service providers used for this purpose can be found below in the section on service providers (data collection by third parties and data transfer to third parties).
on the basis of our binding internal guidelines, we will constantly check whether the data of individual persons is still covered by our legitimate interests and whether it can be deleted after the expiry of the internally specified deadlines.

deletion and blocking of personal data.
we process and store your personal data only for the period of time necessary to achieve the purpose of storage or if this has been provided for by the european directive and regulation maker or another legislator in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject.
if the storage purpose ceases to apply or if a storage period prescribed by the european directive and regulation maker or another competent legislator expires, the personal data will be routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions.
as a rule, we will delete data that we have received via e-mails, contact forms or from our service providers and that do not result in an offer process after 2 years.
in individual cases, this period can be extended to up to 3 years due to continued communication.
if a contractual relationship is established, we will retain data that is transferred into an offer process for the duration of this contractual relationship and, after its termination, until the expiry of the regular limitation periods.
if the contact data for individual data subjects is no longer required due to the specific contractual relationship and there are no retention periods for this data, we will also delete the data earlier upon request.
after completion of the application process, we will either transfer incoming applications to the personnel file or delete them after a period of 6 months, if the applicant is not hired.

furthermore, you can object to the collection of data generated by google analytics and related to the use of this website as well as to the processing of this data by google and prevent such processing.

if you would like to make use of this right of rectification, you can contact our contact person below at any time.
d) right to erasure (right to be forgotten).
you have the right to demand that we delete your personal data immediately.
we are also obliged to delete personal data immediately if there is a reason that does not justify the processing of the data (e.

if one of the above reasons applies and you wish to arrange for the deletion of your personal data stored by us, you can contact our contact person below at any time.
he or she will ensure that your request for deletion is complied with immediately.
if we have made your personal data public and we are obliged to erase it, we shall take reasonable measures, including technical measures, having regard to the available technology and the cost of implementation, to inform data controllers who process the personal data that you have requested that we erase all links to or copies or replications of that personal data.
e) right to restrict processing.
you have the right to request us to restrict processing if one of the following conditions is met.
the accuracy of the personal data is contested by you for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of the personal data.
the processing is unlawful, you object to the erasure of the personal data and request instead the restriction of the use of the personal data.
we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
you have objected to the processing pursuant to art.
21 (1) ds-gvo and it is not yet clear whether our legitimate grounds outweigh yours.
if one of the above conditions is met and you would like to request the restriction of your personal data stored by us, you can contact our contact person below at any time.

this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
we will no longer process the personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims.
