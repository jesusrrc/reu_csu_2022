terms and conditions.
if you use the transition network website (the “website”)  you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions.
data protection.
on may 25th, 2018 a new data protection law came into being across europe called the general data protection regulation.
this regulation is designed to unify all data protection laws across europe and provide a greater level of control for individuals in how organisations can handle and use their data.
we are committed to protecting your privacy and working within the boundaries provided by that regulation.
there are five specific rights that are issued to individuals by the gdpr, and we acknowledge our responsibility in providing those rights.
right to be forgotten.
you may terminate your transition network account at any time, in which case we will permanently delete your account and all data associated with it.
right to object.
occasionally we may choose to carry out data research on all or segments of our data to support and develop the transition movement.
you may opt out of inclusion of your data in our research projects simply by changing the privacy setting on your account, or by informing us in writing.
please note that we will never sell or give your data to other organisations and if we share research with appropriate like-minded organisations, it will always be without personal details.
right to rectification.
you may access and update your transition network account settings at any time to correct or complete your account information.
you may also contact transition network at any time to access, correct, amend or delete information that we hold about you.
right of access.
our privacy policy describes what data we collect and how we use it.
if you have specific questions about data, you can contact for further information at any time.
right of portability.
we will export your account data to a third party at any time upon your request.
we may contact you to confirm that is if it appears that your email has been compromised to make sure we don’t share your data without consent.
we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.
this does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.
the use of this data is described in our privacy policy.
we may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.

tracking.
like millions of other websites we use google analytics on  and transitiontogether.

google analytics is a piece of software that collects data about our visitors (you).
it’s something like an advanced server log.
what does google analytics record.
what website you came from to get here.

what kind of computer you’re using.
what do we do with your data.
the tracking information allows us to better understand the kind of people who come to the site and what content they’re reading.
this allows us to make better decisions about design and writing.
occasionally, we will compile aggregated statistics about the number of visitors this site receives and the browsers being used.
no personally identifying data is included in this type of reporting.
all of our activity falls within the bounds of the  google analytics terms of service.

branding & assets.
we’ve put resources into creating a graphical identity that will keep transition network noticeable, distinctive and visually connected to transition groups around the world.
the sections below tell you all you need to know, and probably a bit more.
warning.
this page couldn’t exist without brand-speak and corp-talk rearing their ugly heads.
please excuse their intrusion, we’ll try to keep it to a minimum.
in brief – for transition initiatives and community groups.
do you want to show that you’re part of this wonderful network of transitioners.
if you’re a community-wide initiative, taking account of peak oil and climate change and you’re striving for resilience and co2 reductions in an inclusive manner, it doesn’t matter to us whether you’re following the transition model slavishly or irreverently, or indeed reinventing it (and sharing your great ideas).
in all cases, we invite you to use this “endorsement” marque freely.
download the graphics for use on your flyers, website, posters, currency notes or whatever seems appropriate.
more info on the usage is further down the page and in the endorsement marque guidelines.
not so brief – the full scoop on transition network’s “branding”.
for the sake of simplicity, we’ve divided the world up into five.
transition network (the organisation).
national transition hubs (such as transition us, transition support scotland, transition sweden).
transitioning communities (ie communities and groups that are actively engaged in transition).
partners and allies.
the rest of the world.
the branding elements for each of these are discussed below.
transition network – the organisation.
transition network’s branding guidelines are contained in this document.
this document is aimed at all parts of the transition network “organisation”, covering formal documents, powerpoint presentations, headed paper, bids, reports, proposals, website, flyers, “business cards”, et al.
we’re starting the process of harmonising to this branding – it’ll be a gradual, rather than short and sharp, process owing to resourcing constraints.
transition hubs.
national hubs that have agreed and signed the memorandum of understanding, may.
– on signing the mou may use the endorsement marque.
– once they’ve reached stage 2, can adopt the transition network branding.
the graphic alongside shows how that might look for the logo (fyi, italy aren’t quite there yet, but have the logo all ready and waiting).
– in general, we recommend they adopt/adapt the main branding guidelines in the branding document.
but if they develop their own look and feel that suits their national demeanour, we’ll be very happy to see that diversity emerging – see transition us logo to the right.
transitioners – communities, and groups actively engaged in transition.
for this group, we have something called an “endorsement marque”.
everything you need to know about it, and more, is contained in this crisply written set of guidelines.
it’s aimed at the following transition initiatives and community groups.
so if you’re a community-wide initiative, taking account of peak oil and climate change and you’re striving for resilience and co2 reductions in an inclusive manner, it doesn’t matter to us whether you’re following the transition model slavishly or irreverently, or indeed reinventing it (and sharing your great ideas).
in all cases, we invite you to use the marque freely.
incidentally, you don’t have to have “transition” in the name of your initiative eg “low carbon exeter” or “sustaining dunbar”.
however, “zero resilience climatedeniersville” may raise a few eyebrows….
stick it on your posters, on your flyers, embroider it on bath towels, stencil it onto your compost bin.
the limits are set only by your imagination (and common decency).
and don’t wait to get “official” status either – use wantonly right from the get-go.
partners and allies.
for this group, the endorsement marque applies.
as you’d expect, you’ll need to talk to us first before you can use the marque.
a) supporters.
– a somewhat woolly term….
– if you’ve given us loads of money, or a venue for a conference, or perhaps a suitcase full of hemp-based, open source, locally manufactured, eco-powered wonder gadgets and you espouse transition values, you’re eligible to use the marque if you so wish.
– please ask us first.
b) campaigners.
– we’re often asked by campaigning organisations for support.
we’re exceedingly picky about this, owing to our feelings that, while “campaigns against” certain negative things are essential, we’re focusing more on “working towards” positive outcomes.
that said, given the times we’re facing, we feel that some campaigns need all the help they can get.
– we’ll seriously consider all serious requests – ask us here.
c) organisations.
– there are some organisations with whom we collaborate extensively, and they feel very much part of the spirit of transition.
if you think this applies to your organisation and you haven’t heard from us yet, please contact us.
the rest of the world.
if an individual shop within a national chain of healthfood stores establishes an agreement with their local food group in the local transition initiative to supply them with local food, then should they be permitted to use the endorsement marque.
some would say yes, others no.
something worth a wide discussion….
if a national supermarket chain did that – well, realistically, who out there imagines that happening.
we’ll cross that bridge when when/if we come to it.
if tar sands inc.
were to contact us to request permission to put the transition network endorsement marque on their 180-tonne dump trucks, then we’d have to start up a new category entitled “transition greenwashers”.
we don’t have a logo for them, but it would be fun designing one.
