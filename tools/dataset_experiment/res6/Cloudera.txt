service-specific terms.
cloudera navigator optimizer and workload analytics.
data use.
cloudera’s navigator optimizer service (“optimizer”) and workload analytics service (“workload analytics”) do not collect or store any personal data or customer data.
these services may collect and/or store certain types of transaction data such as customer’s queries or workload information (“analytics data”).
while analytics data is confidential information and will be protected pursuant to the provisions in this policy that apply to transaction data, optimizer and workload analytics are not databases of record for the storage of analytics data.
retention of this analytics data is not cloudera’s responsibility.
availability.
cloudera is committed to making optimizer and workload analytics highly-available services that customers can count on.
to the extent feasible, cloudera’s infrastructure runs on systems that are fault-tolerant, for failures of individual servers.
cloudera’s operations team tests disaster-recovery measures regularly and staffs a team to quickly resolve unexpected incidents.
however, at this time cloudera makes no uptime or availability guarantees with respect to optimizer or workload analytics or retention of analytics data.
cloudera dataflow for the public cloud.
cloudera dataflow for the public cloud (“cdf-pc”) provides the capability for customer to centrally manage data flows across multiple server clusters, environments, and public cloud providers.
to enable this, cdf-pc allows customer to upload and store certain metadata about customer’s data flows (“flow definitions”) in a central catalog within cdp public cloud control plane (“control plane”).
each flow definition is encrypted with its own unique encryption key and stored in control plane where it may then be accessed by customer.
customer may use cdf-pc to.
(a) load flow definitions into a customer environment (as such term is defined in the cloudera online services terms of service) in cdp public cloud, and (b) execute the flow definitions in the customer environment.
control plane is hosted and runs in a multi-tenant environment.
cloudera does, however, implement reasonable technical controls and safeguards designed to help ensure logical separation and privacy as between different cloudera customer accounts.
flow definitions are considered transaction data as such terms is used in this data policy.
provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this data policy, cloudera will use flow definitions only for the following purposes.
(a) to store flow definitions that are loaded into control plane by customer, (b) to remove from flow definitions any content that violates this data policy, and (c) to the extent necessary to (i) investigate cdp public cloud security issues.
(ii) investigate cdp public cloud performance issues, or (iii) comply with applicable law or a binding order of a governmental body.
as flow definitions are customer-generated content, customer (not cloudera) is solely responsible for ensuring that flow definitions contain the intended information (that is, metadata describing customer’s dataflow logic) and do not contain data prohibited from being included in transaction data by this data policy.
without limiting the foregoing, customer must ensure that neither the name of each flow definition nor the flow definition content includes any personal data (including without limitation personally identifiable information (pii), personal health information (phi) regulated under the health insurance portability and accessibility act of 1996 (as amended and supplement) (hipaa)), or cardholder data as defined under the payment card industry data security standard (pci-dss).
customer is responsible for ensuring that flow definitions adhere to the “acceptable use” terms of this data policy, including without limitation, those terms that prohibit customer from using cdp public cloud, cdf-pc or flow definitions (i) in any manner that would violate the security or integrity of any network, computer or communications system, software application, or network or computing device, or (ii) for any illegal, harmful or offensive use, or to transmit, store, display, distribute or otherwise make available content that is illegal, harmful, or offensive.
