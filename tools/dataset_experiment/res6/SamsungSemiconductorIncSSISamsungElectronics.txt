g.
requests made in 2022 will receive information about 2021 sharing activities).
we comply with this law by giving users the ability to tell us not to share personally identifiable information with third parties for              their direct marketing purposes.

you should exercise caution, and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.
we also may make available to you certain services offered by third parties.

do not track signals and other tracking mechanisms.
some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates, although web browsers incorporate and activate this functionality in different ways, and it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted.
there currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.
ssi currently              does not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.
