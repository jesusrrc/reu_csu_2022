regulations on the protection of personal data.
there are currently various documents covering data protection in place at the national, international, and european levels.
the main ones are the following.
law no.
78-17 of 6 january 1978 on data processing, files, and freedoms.
directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 24 october 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, repealed on 25 may 2018 by regulation (eu) 2016/679.
regulation (eu) 2016/679 of the european parliament and of the council of 27 april 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing directive 95/46/ec (general data protection regulation).
charter of fundamental rights of the european union (2012/c 326/02).
convention for the protection of individuals with regard to the automated processing of personal data.
teeptrak undertakes to abide by its obligations in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, in particular, the general data protection regulations (gdpr).
we strongly encourage all of our clients to be particularly vigilant on these compliance aspects.
other more specific regulations may also exist, in particular for certain categories of personal data.
it is the client’s responsibility to properly identify the regulations applicable to their activities, in order to comply with them.
data protection officer (dpo).

.
gdpr.
the general data protection regulation (gdpr) is the legal framework for the processing of personal data in europe, as of 25 may 2018.
unlike directive 95/46/ec, which previously governed these treatments, the gdpr is directly applicable in the union and does not require national transpositions.
as such, it will promote the harmonization of legal regimes on the protection of personal data in europe.
better still, the gdpr has an extraterritoriality principle, which allows, in certain circumstances, to extend its scope beyond euopean borders.
if you are a structure dealing with personal data, there is a good chance that you will be subject to the provision of the gdpr.
in this regard, you are subject to obligations that you must comply with.
the same applies to teeptrak, which, in view of its situation, will have seperate obligations.

definitions.
understanding the real, specific issues at stake in european regulations is not always an easy task, especially when it  contains 99 articles, 173 recitals and numerous guidelines used to clarify its interpretation.
however, this is essential in order to avoid any risk that may result from an overly broad or imprecise interpretation of the regulatory obligations of your structure.
a proper understanding of the terms defined below is therefore essential.
