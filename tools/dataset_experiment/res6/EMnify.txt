iii.
general.
1.
the extent to which personal data is processed.
we collect and use the personal data of users of our homepage only to the extent that this is necessary for keeping our website, contents and services functioning properly.
basically, we collect and use our users’ personal data only after they give their consent.
an exception to this principle applies in cases where processing the data by statutory provisions is permitted or when obtaining prior consent for actual reasons is not possible.
2.
legal basis for processing personal data.
the legal basis for processing personal data is basically based on.
art.
6 section 1 lit.
a gdpr upon obtaining the consent of the data subject.
art.
6 section 1 lit.
b gdpr for processing operations that serve to fulfil a contract to which the data subject is a party.
included here are processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.
art.
6 section 1 lit.
c gdpr for processing required to fulfil a legal obligation.
art.
6 section 1 lit.
d gdpr, if vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data.
art.
6 section 1 lit.
f gdpr, if the processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or a third party, and the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the former interest.
3.
data erasure and storage duration.
the personal data of users will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of the storage is no longer applicable.
additional storage may be provided for by european or national legislators through eu regulations, laws, or other regulations to which the data controller is subject.
blocking or deleting the data also takes place when a storage period prescribed by the standards mentioned expires unless there is a need for additional storage of the data for concluding a contract or fulfilling the contract.
iv.
use of our website, general information.
1.
description and scope of data processing.
every time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the user's computer system.
the following information is collected.
information about the browser type and version used.
the user’s operating system.
the user’s ip address.
date and time of access.
websites the user’s system accesses to get to our website.
websites that the user's system invokes by accessing our website.
the described data are stored in the log files of our system.
this data is not stored together with any other personal user data.
2.
purpose and legal basis for data processing.
our system must temporarily store user ip addresses to allow us to deliver our website to the user's computer.
to do this, the user's ip address must be stored for the duration of the session.
storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the website.
in addition, the data is used to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.
this data is not evaluated for marketing purposes in this context.
the legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is art.
6 section 1 lit.
f gdpr.
collecting your personal data to ensure our web presence and storing this data in log files is essential for operating our website.
a contradictory possibility of the user therefore does not exist.
3.
duration of storage.
your data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary for achieving the purpose of the inquiry.
your data will be deleted when the session ends if your data has been collected to ensure the site's availability.
if your data is stored in log files, it will be deleted after seven days at the latest.
further storage is possible, whereby in this case, the ip addresses of the users are deleted or alienated.
this means that it is then no longer possible to assign the client who has accessed our website.
v.
general information about the use of cookies.
we use cookies on our website.
cookies are text files that are stored in the internet browser or by the internet browser on the user’s computer system.
if you display a website, this is how a cookie can be stored on your operating system.
this cookie contains a characteristic string that allows the browser to be clearly when the website is accessed again.
we use cookies to make our homepage more user friendly.
some elements of our website require that the browser be identified even after a page break.
ttdsg.
the legal basis for the storage of cookies, device identifiers and similar tracking technologies or for the storage of information in the end user's terminal equipment and access to this information is the european eprivacy directive in conjunction with the telecommunications and telemedia data protection act (ttdpa.
in german.
ttdsg).
please note that the legal basis for the processing of personal data collected in this context then results from the gdpr.
the relevant legal basis for the processing of personal data in each specific case can be found below the respective cookie or the respective processing itself.
the primary legal basis for the storage of information in the end user's terminal equipment - consequently in particular for the storage of cookies - is their consent, §25 abs.
1 s.
1 ttdpa (ger.
ttdsg).
consent is given when visiting our website - although this does not have to be given, of course - and can be revoked at any time in the cookie settings.
according to §25 abs.
2 nr.
2 ttdpa (ger.
ttdsg), consent is not required if the storage of information in the end user's terminal equipment or access to information already stored in the end user's terminal equipment is absolutely necessary for the provider of a tele media service to be able to provide a tele media service expressly requested by the user.
you can see from the cookie settings which cookies are to be classified as absolutely necessary (often also referred to as "technically necessary cookies") and which consequently fall under the exception of §25 para.
2 ttdpa (ger.
ttdsg), therefore do not require consent.
gdpr.
the following data is stored and transmitted.
(1) language settings(2) log-in information.
we would like to point out that some functions on our website can only be offered if cookies are enabled.
this applies to the following applications.
(1) adopting language settings(2) remembering keywords.
we do not use user data collected by technically required cookies to create user profiles.
cookies are stored on the user’s computer, which transmits them to our page.
as a user, you therefore have control over the use of cookies.
you can restrict or disable transmission of cookies by making changes to your internet browser settings.
here you can also delete cookies that have been stored.
please note that you may not be able to use all the features on our website if you deactivate cookies.
vi.
data transfer outside the eu.
the gdpr ensures an equally high level of data protection within the european union.
when selecting our service providers, we therefore rely on european partners wherever possible if your personal data is to be processed.
only in exceptional cases will we have data processed outside the european union in the context of using third-party services.
we will only allow your data to be processed in a third country if the special requirements of art.
44 et seq.
dsgvo are fulfilled.
this means that your data may then only be processed based on special guarantees, such as the officially recognized determination by the eu commission of a level of data protection corresponding to the eu or the observance of officially recognized special contractual obligations, the so-called "standard data protection clauses".
vii.
your rights/rights of the data subject.
according to the eu general data protection regulation, as an affected party you have the following rights.
1.
right to access.
as a data controller you have the right to obtain from us the information whether and which personal data concerning you are processed by us as well as further information in accordance with the legal requirements pursuant to art.

9 section 2 lit.
a gdpr protected and you revoke the consent.
another condition is that there is no other legal basis for the processing.
you object to the processing (art.
21 section 1 gdpr) and there are no legitimate reasons for the processing.
another possibility is that you have a protest against the processing pursuant to art.
21 section 2 gdpr.
the processing of your personal data is unlawful.
deleting personal data concerning you is required to fulfil a legal obligation under union law or the law of the member states to which the data controller is subject.
the personal data concerning you were collected in relation to information society services offered pursuant to art.
8 section 1 gdpr.
if we have made personal data concerning you public and we are obligated to delete them according to art.
17 section 1 of the gdpr, then we shall take appropriate measures, while also taking the available technology, implementation costs and the available technology into account, to inform data controllers who process the personal data that you, as the data subject, have requested the deletion of all links to such personal data or of copies or replications of such personal data.
we would like to point out that the right to delete does not exist to the extent that processing is required.
to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information.
to fulfil a legal obligation required by the law of the union or of the member states to which the controller is subject, or to carry out a task of public interest or to exercise the official authority conferred on the controller.
for reasons of public interest in the field of public health pursuant to art.
9 section 2 lit.
h and i and art.
9 (3) gdpr.
for archival purposes of public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to art.
89 section 1 gdpr, to the extent that the law referred to in section (a) is likely to render impossible or seriously affect the achievement of the objectives of that processing, or.
to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
5.
right to notification.
if you have asserted the right to rectify, delete or restrict the processing, we are obligated to notify all recipients to whom your personal data have been disclosed of this correction or deletion of the data or restriction of processing, unless this proves to be impossible or is associated with a disproportionate amount of effort.
you also have the right to be informed about these recipients.
6.
right to data portability.
according to the gdpr, you also have the right to obtain the personal data provided to us and to receive it in a structured, understandable and machine-readable format.
furthermore, you have the right to transfer this data to another data controller without hindrance by the data controller for providing the personal data, provided that.
the processing is based on consent as defined in art.
6 section 1 lit.
a gdpr or art.
9 section 2 lit.
a gdpr or on a contract acc.
art.
6 section 1 lit.
b gdpr.
and the processing is done using automated procedures.
finally, where technically feasible and without harm to the freedoms and rights of others and as part of exercising the right of data transferability, you have the right to obtain that personal data related to you that has been transmitted directly from one controller to another.
the right to data portability does not apply to processing that personal data necessary for performing a task in the public interest or for exercising the official authority that has been delegated to the data controller.
7.
right to revoke the declaration of consent.
you have the right to revoke your data protection declaration at any time.
please note that revoking consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out based on the consent until the revocation goes into effect.
8.
right to objection.
the data controller will no longer process the personal data concerning you unless he can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights and liberties, or the processing is for enforcing, exercising, or defending legal claims.
if the personal data related to you are processed for advertising purposes, then you have the right to object at any time to your personal data being processed for such advertising.
this also applies to profiling, as far as it is associated with such direct marketing.
your personal data will no longer be processed for direct marketing purposes if you object to your data being used for such purposes.
you also have the option of discussing the use of information society services (despite directive 2002/58/ec).
exercise your right to object by using automated procedures that use technical specifications.
9.
automated decision on an individual basis, including profiling.
under the eu general data protection regulation, you remain entitled not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing - including profiling - which would have legal effect or would affect you in a similar manner.
an exception to this principle, however, is when the decision.
is required for concluding or fulfilling a contract between you and the data controller,.
and is permissible based on union or member state legislation to which the controller is subject, and that legislation contains adequate measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests, or.
is with your express consent.
if the processing is carried out in accordance with the cases mentioned in section 1 and 3, then the data controller shall take appropriate measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests.
this includes at least the right to obtain the intervention of a person on the part of the data controller to state his own position and to contest the decision.
the ruling under (1) – (3) may not be based on special categories of personal data pursuant to art.
9 section 1 gdpr, unless art.
9 section 2 lit.
a or g and reasonable measures have been taken to protect the rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests.
10.
right to complain to a supervisory authority.
finally, if you believe that the processing of personal data concerning you is contrary to the gdpr, you have the right to complain to a supervisory authority, in the member state of its place of residence, employment or the location of the alleged infringement.
