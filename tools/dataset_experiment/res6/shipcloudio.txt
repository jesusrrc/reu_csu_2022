data security.
we use the widespread ssl method (secure socket layer) with the highest encryption level supported by your browser.
usually this is a 2048-bit encryption.
if your browser does not support 2048-bit encryption, we will instead use the maximum encryption possible with your browser.
you can tell whether an individual site on our website is encrypted by the closed key or lock symbol in the lower status bar of your browser.
apart from this, we rely on appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against random or wilful manipulation, partial or complete loss, destruction or against unauthorized access by third parties.
our security measures are continuously improved in line with the newest technological developments.
