we also obtain data from third parties.
expand the sections below to learn more.
information you provide to intel voluntarily.
when you subscribe to a newsletter, create an account, make a purchase or request information from intel, we will ask for things like contact, billing, shipping and communication information, payment card or financial account data, and account id or credentials in order to fulfill your request.
if you visit one of our stores or locations, attend a trade show or event, or otherwise contact us, you may also voluntarily provide similar information.
interactive features in some intel® services may allow you to invite friends, follow others, comment on or make unique posts, or share photos, video or other personal content.
when you affirmatively share this content, we may collect and use it in accordance with this notice.
additionally, by way of your social engagement, we may receive information about you from another user, such as when your friend posts content that includes you.
from time to time we engage in research, analysis, historical and scientific studies either alone or with partners.
as part of such efforts we invite individuals to participate and voluntarily share information through an informed consent process.
when we receive personal information from a third party for the purpose of such research we undertake processes to validate that the personal information has been collected in a responsible and lawful manner.
if you submit any personal information about other people to us or to our service providers, you are responsible for making sure that you have the authority to do so and to allow us to use their personal information in accordance with this privacy notice (for example, by your asking for their consent).
device and product operation.
if you download and use certain intel® service like software or an app, we may track and collect usage data, such as when the software or app accesses our servers, what information and files have been downloaded through the use of the software or app, and how you interact with the software or app during use.
some of this data may be protected as personal information under applicable data protection laws.
we collect this information to understand how you interact with intel® services and provide you the best experiences.
we may also use this information for security purposes.
we may associate the information we collect from more than one device that you use with other information that we have collected about you or your other devices.
in addition, most computing devices include embedded technology like processing chips that collect information about how the device is operating.
this information may include.
·  type and version of operating system, hardware version, device settings, software types, battery and signal strength, screen resolution, device manufacturer and model, language, and internet browser type and version.
the name and version of any intel® services (such as the app) you are using is also collected.

access to this information by other applications and transmission of this information from the device to intel or other service providers may be controlled by the operating system or other software running on the device.
in some instances intel technology is used within a product or device that may collect personal information, which is not shared with intel.
this information may be collected by the manufacturer of the product or device and you will need to read the privacy notice, privacy policy, or related terms published by that manufacturer to understand how they use your information.
some intel® services may allow you to use biometric information for identification or authentication or to take advantage of specific features.
biometric data may include your fingerprint, facial features, voice or similar unique physical characteristics.
intel® services can also collect geographic location information, such as location inferred from your ip address or gps, and information about how you engage with and use intel® services, for example where you have chosen to activate location-enabled services on the device with which you access these services.
when intel® services use more sensitive categories of your personal information, such as biometrics for identification or authentication, or precise geographic location, intel will honor the preferences you set in accompanying menus and settings.
we collect information from and about a wide variety of technologies where intel® services are used.
the kind of information collected depends on the technology, the use, and the device and personal settings.
examples of these technologies might include computers, phones and tablets, but also interactive wearables, connected technologies in the home, drones or other vehicles.
where we provide technology for drones and autonomous vehicles, these may capture audio, video and photographs that unintentionally or incidentally capture people, for example workers in a field or pedestrians crossing a street.
where appropriate, we use technical and organizational controls to prevent it from being used improperly, but this information is important to help improve algorithms for product functionality and safety, including features such as mapping topography, obstacles, traffic and the like.
information from third parties.
we obtain information through partners, vendors, suppliers and other third parties.
the parties from whom we obtain information are typically corporate enterprises (although some may also be educational or public enterprises) and they may be located in any of the locations in which we do business.
these enterprises largely fall into the following categories.
advertising and marketing companies, data set and information vendors, public database providers, social media platforms, partners, providers of products or services, hosts or vendors at events or trade shows, research partners, enterprises that deploy the intel® services or third party offerings that include intel® services.
we take steps to confirm that information we receive from these third parties has been collected with your consent or that these parties are otherwise legally permitted to disclose your personal information to us.
we might also obtain information through a partner, or co-create datasets with a partner, as part of our business operations.
this kind of data is used for work like improving algorithms and data models, product testing and improvement, enhancing existing products and developing new capabilities and features.
in some cases we combine personal information about individuals that we receive from multiple sources, including directly collected from you or through your use of the intel® services.

automated decision-making.
in some instances, our use of your personal information may result in automated decisions being taken (including profiling) that legally affect you or similarly significantly affect you.
automated decisions mean that a decision concerning you is made automatically on the basis of a computer determination (using software algorithms), without our human review which has legal or other significant effect.
we use automated analysis to make predictions such as your level of interest in particular products or services, or automated decision making to prevent theft, fraud or other crime.
intel’s artificial intelligence solutions may lead to automated processing of data in a variety of fields.
in the event that our automated decision making would have a legal effect or significantly affect you we will implement measures to safeguard your rights, freedoms and interests, including performing privacy impact assessments to identify suitable measures to protect your rights, or obtain your explicit consent as required by applicable laws.
when we make this kind of an automated decision about you, you have the right to contest the decision, to express your point of view, and to require a human review of the decision.
you can exercise this right by using the contact details provided under the “how to contact us” section below.
