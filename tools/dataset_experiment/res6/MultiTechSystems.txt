you can travel through most of our site without giving us any information about yourself.
but sometimes we do need information to provide you with the services that you request.
this statement of privacy explains our data collection and use in those situations.

if you send us an email, we may link your ip address to any personal information you provide in that email.
multitech collects personal information when you inquire about "where to buy" our products, ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, use our online ordering services, submit an entry for a sweepstakes or other promotion, or when you submit your information to multitech for any other reason.
choice.
multitech will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing information.
this means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this policy.
in some cases, when applicable, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in.
" this means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.

we will give you the opportunity to opt-out of market research and customer surveys.
credit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention, and is not used for other purposes.

because multitech is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other multitech offices or subsidiaries around the world.
all such entities are governed by this privacy policy and/or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data transfer agreements.
we take seriously the trust you place in us.
multitech will not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to others.
