our approach.
customers’ and stakeholders’ trust is important for telia company.
we want everyone who shares their personal data with us to feel secure that their data is used according to their expectations.
as soon as the general data protection regulation (gdpr ), the eu legislation governing how personal data should be handled, entered into force in 2016, telia company started its group-wide gdpr program.
since numerous principles of gdpr already existed under the old data protection directive, we were able to build on previous experience and best practices while implementing new gdpr principles.

what is gdpr.
gdpr stands for general data protection regulation – an eu law that regulates rights connected with personal data, including by giving all individuals control of their own personal data in all relations with companies, regardless if they are a customer or an employee.
gdpr directly applies in all eu countries as of 25 may 2018 and in in countries of the european economic area.
it covers telia company’s footprint in the nordics and baltics.
there may be some local variations in how gdpr is implemented in different countries, for example, on employee data processing, public health, public sector, archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.
what is personal data.
personal data is all information that could identify an individual directly or indirectly, for instance.
name, address, age, gender and position.
location.
social security number.
ip address.
telephone number.
subscription details.
traffic data (technical data generated when an individual uses telecommunication services).
what has telia company done to be compliant with gdpr.
in early 2016, telia company put in place a gdpr compliance program to carry out necessary changes and implement gdpr provisions across all relevant markets.
telia company gdpr program coordinated all activities related to ensuring our customers’ and employees’ privacy rights.
related projects were running also in all countries and group units.
