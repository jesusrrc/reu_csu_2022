sky labs.
sky labs is responsible for developing aircraft predictive maintenance, unmanned flying aircraft, and autonomous flying drones.
predictive analytics and fault diagnostics of high-value engineering systems often involve processing of real-time sensor data to deduct impeding or hidden problems within the underlying system.
to achieve this, it is necessary to condition the data from sensors and thereafter combine it with prior acquired-data-knowledge of the system in order to create useful insights.
the benefits of such analytics include abilities to prevent costly failures and to generate cost-effective scheduling of maintenance cycles.
to implement such a system, it is necessary to create a setup that can effectively enable data capture, data conditioning, secure transmission, database storage and execute real-time data analytics algorithms.
ocean labs.
ocean labs is developing solutions for the marine and shipping industry.
these solutions will provide tools for autonomous ship navigation and man-over-board detections system.
autonomous shipping presents many challenges.
disparate visual and positional sensor data must be detected, processed, and analyzed at the edge, all in real-time.
with shipping, the data from these sensors are at a greater scale than in other autonomous vehicle applications.
for example, lidar sensors in shipping vessels must detect objects from several kilometers away, often in difficult weather conditions.
shipping vessels also need cameras with far-higher pixel count to see objects in, on, and over the water at distances of several kilometers, which means that large digital images must be processed with great detail.
in addition, shipping vessels need to be outfitted with thermal, radar, and other sensors, data from the multitude of sensors need to be fused together in order to read the environment.
these sensors can produce enormous amounts of data – as much as 1tb of data per day, per vessel, about the same digital footprint as 250 high-definition feature-length movies.
earth labs.
earth labs is developing tools that will be used in agriculture and green energy.
there are many areas of agriculture and green energy that ai will  have the potential to revolutionize.
ai-powered tools for agriculture and green energy will be able to make more intelligent decisions.
body labs.
body labs is developing solutions to augment doctors ability to detect  cancer and illness with higher accuracy.
brand code.
the first element distinguishing a well-prepared company is the presence of a brand code.
now you can create a company's dna and understand how your product or service is useful to the consumer.
a quality brand code makes it possible to answer the main questions, and help you grow as a business.
what's included.
mission/business scope.
vision.
value propositions.
slogan.
style.
targeting.
product/usefulness.
after this stage begins market segmentation by the 6w method  which allows you to see who will be your customers and  how you can provide your services/benefits to them.
and, in the context of fund-raising, the availability of ready-made brand code will allow investors, as well as your team, get a clear vision on what the service/product is all about.
on the other hand, it helps to understand where the weakest and most vulnerable places of the startup are.
the results will save you a lot of money during the marketing campaign and will save time for your team at every stage of business development.
