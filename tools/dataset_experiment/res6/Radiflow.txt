our solutions and benefits for.
radiflow provides cisos full ics network visibility including all device properties and vulnerabilities, as well as the threat landscape it operates in and its current level of exposure to risk – in addition to threat detection and asset management.
radiflow’s solutions are designed for both in-house soc operation and cloud-based security at an mssp’s premises and are fully iec 62443-compatible.
radiflow’s solutions employ non-intrusive, non-destructive methods to protect, monitor and assess risk in ot networks, to ensure continuous uptime.
this includes smart collectors at remote sites for bandwidth-efficient transfer of mirrored data streams to the soc for analysis and the use of digital images, rather than the actual ot network, for running breach and attack simulations.
radiflow’s entire approach to ongoing ics protection and hardening is business-driven.
as such it provides the flexibility for c-level executives to plan their network protection activities and expenditure based on custom operational needs, long-term budget constraints and compliance regulations and preferences.
the radiflow platform can be enhanced with integrated solutions for siem, analytics, privileges management, network security, asset management and more.
radiflow’s apis enable two-way data enrichment with integrated solutions including device properties, vulnerabilities and anomaly detection data sent to partners’ systems, and device, security and operational data from integrated solution sent back to radiflow.
save costs with our  risk based approach.
radiflow offers risk assessment and management solutions grounded in deep understanding of the ot/ics security arena.
we empower our customers to manage their threats with top notch innovative ot cyber security solutions and to optimize ot-security expenditure with roi based solutions.
