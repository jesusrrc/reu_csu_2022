sketchup, trimble, and your privacy.
as part of trimble, we are dedicated to keeping your data private and            secure.
we are also committed to transparency, so we want you to understand            the information we may collect from you and why we collect it.
the            following is a supplement to trimble’s privacy commitment.
the information we collect falls into three categories.

profile information.
we store information you provide to us to maintain a profile associated                            with your trimble account.
