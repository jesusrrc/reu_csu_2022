box 81226, seattle, wa 98108-1226,  (“cloudfront”) that speeds up distribution of static and dynamic web content such as .
html, .
css, .
js, and image files, to users.
cloudfront delivers content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations.
when a user requests content that is being served with cloudfront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.
if the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, cloudfront delivers it immediately.
if the content is not in that edge location, cloudfront retrieves it from an amazon s3 bucket (where we have hosted our assets for the website) or an http server (in our case, our production web servers in rackspace) that has been identified as the source for the definitive version of the content.
cloudfront captures information about each request that includes system logs which captures the following information.
ip address, lat/long of the server which served the request, country and date and time.

the information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency of your visits to our site, including your ip address, is transmitted to google’s location in the us and stored there.

google uses this information to analyze your use of our site, to compile reports for us on internet activity and to provide other services relating to our website.
google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law or where such third parties process this data on google’s behalf.

the add-on tells the javascript (ga.
js) used by google analytics not to transmit any information about website visits to google analytics.
however, the browser deactivation add-on offered by google analytics does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analysis services we may engage.
google analytics also uses electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used.
