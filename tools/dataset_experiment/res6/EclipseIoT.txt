eclipse foundation website privacy policy.
may 24, 2018.
the eclipse foundation, inc.
("eclipse foundation", "us" or "we") is a member-supported not-for-profit    foundation which acts as the steward of our open source projects, community, and ecosystem.
we are    committed to our community members’ rights to privacy.
we promise to share transparently all aspects    of how eclipse foundation projects and websites work in regards to privacy, terms, and personal data,    and we are in full support of efforts to ensure your protection online.
we only collect your personal    data with your consent, and collect only as much as we need to provide you the service you request.
for    example, we need your personal data to register you to one of our conferences.
each time we collect    additional personal data from you we will explain what we collect, why we need it, how we use it, how    long we keep it, and how we protect it.
you can withdraw consent anytime.
we will respect your wishes.
personal information on eclipse foundation websites.
as a platform for open source innovation and collaboration, personal information on all eclipse    foundation websites is either meant to be shared, for example records of your contributions to our    open source projects, or protected, such as your name and email address when you subscribe to    our newsletter.
any personal data you share with us, we protect according to this privacy policy.
individual access to personal information.
we will respond within 30 days to your requests to have access to your personal information collected  by us.
we will promptly correct inaccuracies, as the case may be, and we will delete it and/or anonymize  it upon your request.
please contact to make  such a request.
information security and quality.
we protect the integrity of your personal information with appropriate technical and organizational    measures, such as using encryption for transmission of certain forms of information, to help keep it    secure, accurate, current, and complete.
your personal information may be stored in canada, the european union and the united states,    always with our same high security standards.
one of the primary purposes of the eclipse foundation and its websites is to enable collaborative    open source software development.
doing so necessarily requires us to maintain records of    authorship related to all contributions.
any personally identifiable information collected by virtue of    your contributions will be publicly available on the internet in unencrypted form and without access    restriction.
we also offer services to our community which provide the ability for users of eclipse software to    store data on eclipse foundation servers through services including, but not limited to, the user    storage service and the automated error reporting initiative.
any data stored through these    services will be publicly available on the internet in unencrypted form and without access restriction.
therefore, you should not use these services to store passwords, any personally identifiable    information, any confidential business information, or anything else that you do not want to be    generally and publicly available.
clickstream data and cookies.
we sometimes collect anonymous information from visits and contributions to eclipse foundation    websites to help provide better service.
for example, we keep track of the domains from which    people visit and we also measure visitor activity on eclipse foundation websites, but in ways that    keep the information anonymous.
this anonymous information is sometimes known as "clickstream    data.
" we may use and aggregate this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us tailor our    websites to better serve eclipse participants.
