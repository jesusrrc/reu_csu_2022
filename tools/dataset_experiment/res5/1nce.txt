The personal data of the data subject will be erased or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply.
Furthermore, data may be stored if this has been provided for in EU or Member State regulations, laws or other provisions to which the data controller is subject.
The data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed in one of the aforementioned provisions expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.
Every time you visit our website (1nce.

The following data is collected.
The data is also stored in the log files of our system.

The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable the website to be made available to the user’s computer.
To that effect the IP address of the user must remain stored for the duration of the session.
The data is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website.
In addition, the data serves us to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.
An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.

The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected.
In the case of collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case when the respective session has ended.
If the data is stored in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest.
Further storage is possible.
In this case, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or alienated, so that an identification of the calling client is no longer possible.
The collection of the data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is absolutely necessary for the operation of the website.
Consequently, there is no possibility of objection on the part of the user.
Our website uses cookies.
Cookies are text files that are stored in the internet browser or by the Internet browser on the user’s computer system.

We also use cookies on our website which enable an analysis of the user behavior on our website.
In this way, the following data can be transmitted.
The user data collected in this way is pseudonymized by technical precautions.
Therefore, it is no longer possible to assign the data to the calling user.

The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected.
The name and email address of the user will therefore be stored for as long as the subscription to the newsletter is active.
Other personal data collected during the technical registration process will normally be deleted within a period of seven days.
The subscription to the newsletter can be cancelled by the user at any time.
For this purpose, there is a corresponding link in every newsletter.
By doing so, it is also possible to revoke the consent to the storage of personal data collected during the technical registration process.
Contact forms are available on our website which can be used for electronic contact.
There is the possibility of using a general contact form to address requests or questions of any kind to us, as well as special contact forms that serve, for example, to request offers for our services or to establish a specific press contact.

The processing of personal data from the respective input mask serves us solely for the purpose of treating the contact established by the user.
In case of contact by email, this also constitutes the necessary legitimate interest in the processing of the data.
The other personal data processed during the sending process serves to prevent misuse of the contact button/form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.
The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected.
This is the case for the personal data entered into the input mask of the con­tact form and the data transmitted by email or telephone, when the respective con­ver­sa­tion with the user has ended.
The conversation is terminated when it can be assumed according to the circumstances that the issues in question have been finally clarified.
The additional personal data collected during the sending process will be deleted after a period of seven days at the latest.
The user has the possibility to revoke his consent to the processing of personal data at any time.
In such a case, the conversation cannot be continued.
The user can revoke his consent and object to the storage of personal data at any time by sending an email to or by writing to our address (1NCE GmbH, Sternengasse 14-16, 50676 Cologne, Germany).
All personal data stored in the course of contacting us will be deleted in this case.
The foregoing does not apply on an exceptional basis if there is a concrete suspicion that the user in question might have acted illegally in the context of making contact (e.
g.
in the case of offensive or other statements that violate personal rights) and a continued storage of the data concerned is at least directly permitted by Art.
