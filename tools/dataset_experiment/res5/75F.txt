You will bear your own costs and expenses in conducting business electronically, and will undertake all steps necessary, including software, hardware and other equipment upgrades and purchases, in order to be able to conduct business electronically.
(d) Injunctive Relief.
You agree that breach of the provisions of this EULA would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to 75F which would be both difficult to ascertain and which would not be compensable by damages alone.
As such, you agree that 75F has the right to enforce the provisions of this EULA by injunction (without necessity of posting bond), specific performance, or other equitable relief without prejudice to any other rights and remedies 75F may have for your breach of this EULA.
All remedies available to 75F will be cumulative and the pursuit of one remedy will not be deemed to exclude any other remedy.
(e) Entire Agreement.
This EULA constitutes the entire agreement between you and 75F with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, both oral and written, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
(f) Waiver.
75F’s failure to enforce the provisions of this EULA will not be deemed to be a waiver of its right to enforce them.
(g) Severability.
(a)   If any term or provision of this EULA will be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining terms and provisions of this EULA will remain in full force and effect, and such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable term or provision will be deemed not to be part of this EULA.
(h) Survival.
The provisions of this EULA that by their content are intended to survive the expiration or termination of this EULA, including, without limitation, provisions governing ownership and use of intellectual property, representations, disclaimers, warranties, liability, indemnification, governing law, jurisdiction, venue, remedies, rights after termination, and interpretation of this EULA, will survive the expiration or termination of this EULA for their full statutory period.
(i) Assignment.
You may not assign, transfer, or sell (voluntarily or by operation of law) your rights or obligations under this EULA, nor delegate your duties hereunder to any other person, without 75F’s prior written consent.
Any purported assignment without 75F’s consent will be void and will constitute a breach of this EULA.
75F may assign this EULA or delegate or subcontract its obligations under this EULA at any time.
(j) Notifications.
You can contact us through your 75F account or by email.
Unless you tell 75F otherwise, or the law requires otherwise, you agree to receive all communications from 75F by email or through posting notices to your account.
You may print the communications for your records.
You agree that all communications that 75F sends to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that a communication be in writing.
You may choose to get legal notices in paper form through the mail if you tell 75F you do not want legal notices sent electronically.
If you choose to paper form, legal notices will be sent to you in paper form by postal mail or as otherwise permitted or required by law.
All other communications not required by law to be in paper form will be sent electronically.
To tell 75F that you do not want legal notices sent electronically send the notice in writing and by certified and registered mail to 1650 West 82nd Suite #200, Bloomington MN 55431.
