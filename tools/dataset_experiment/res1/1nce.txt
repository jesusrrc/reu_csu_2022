we only process personal data of our users if this is necessary to provide a functioning website  or to establish contact between the user and us via this website. the processing of personal data of our users usually only takes place with the user’s consent. an exception applies in those cases in which prior consent cannot be obtained for factual reasons and/or the processing of the data is permitted by provisions of statutory law.

to the extent we obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data, art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. a gdpr serves as a legal basis.
if the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. b gdpr serves as a legal basis. this also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.
to the extent the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. c gdpr serves as a legal basis.
in the event that the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, art. 6 para.1 subpara. 1 lit. d gdpr serves as a legal basis.
if processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the first interest, art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. f gdpr serves as a legal basis.

the personal data of the data subject will be erased or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply. furthermore, data may be stored if this has been provided for in eu or member state regulations, laws or other provisions to which the data controller is subject. the data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed in one of the aforementioned provisions expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.


every time you visit our website (1nce.com), our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the calling computer.
the following data is collected:
the data is also stored in the log files of our system. this data is not stored together with other personal data of the user.

the legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. f gdpr.

the temporary storage of the ip address by the system is necessary to enable the website to be made available to the user’s computer. to that effect the ip address of the user must remain stored for the duration of the session.
the data is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website. in addition, the data serves us to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. an evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.
our legitimate interest in data processing therefore results from art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. f gdpr.

the data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. in the case of collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case when the respective session has ended.
if the data is stored in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest. further storage is possible. in this case, the ip addresses of the users are deleted or alienated, so that an identification of the calling client is no longer possible.

the collection of the data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is absolutely necessary for the operation of the website. consequently, there is no possibility of objection on the part of the user.

our website uses cookies. cookies are text files that are stored in the internet browser or by the internet browser on the user’s computer system. if a user visits a website, a cookie may be stored on the user’s operating system. this cookie contains a characteristic string of characters that enables a unique identification of the browser when the website is called up again. we use cookies to make our website more user-friendly. certain elements of our website require that the calling browser can be identified even after a page change.
the following data is stored and transmitted in the cookies:
we also use cookies on our website which enable an analysis of the user behavior on our website. in this way, the following data can be transmitted:
the user data collected in this way is pseudonymized by technical precautions. therefore, it is no longer possible to assign the data to the calling user. the data will not be stored together with other personal data of the user.
when accessing our website, the user is informed about the use of cookies for analytical purposes and his consent to the processing of personal data used in this context is obtained. in this context, reference is also made to this privacy statement.

the legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies is art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. f gdpr.
the legal basis for the processing of personal data using technically necessary cookies is art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. f gdpr.
the legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies for analysis purposes is art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. a gdpr.

the purpose of using technically necessary cookies is to simplify the use of websites for users. some functions of our website cannot be offered without the use of cookies. for this it is necessary that the browser is recognized even after a page change.
we need cookies for the following applications:
the user data collected by technically necessary cookies are not used to create user profiles.
the analysis cookies are used to improve the quality of our website and its content. through the analysis cookies we learn how the website is used and can thus continuously optimize our offer.
for these purposes, our legitimate interest also lies in the processing of personal data in accordance with art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. f gdpr.

cookies are stored on the user’s computer and transmitted to our site. therefore, users also have full control over the use of cookies. by changing the settings in his internet browser, the user can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies. cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. this can also be done automatically. if cookies are deactivated for our website, it may no longer be possible to use all functions of the website in full.

you can subscribe to a free newsletter on our website. when registering for the newsletter, the data from the input mask is transmitted to us. this applies to the following data:
in addition, the following data is collected upon registration:
(1) ip address of the calling computer
(2) date and time of registration
the user’s consent is obtained for processing the data as part of the technical registration process and reference is made to this privacy statement.
in connection with data processing for the dispatch of newsletters, no data is passed on to third parties. the data will be used exclusively for sending the newsletter.

the legal basis for the processing of data after registration for the newsletter by the user is art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. a gdpr.

the collection of the user’s email address serves to subsequently send the newsletter.
the collection of other personal data as part of the technical registration process serves to prevent misuse of the services or the email address used.

the data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. the name and email address of the user will therefore be stored for as long as the subscription to the newsletter is active.
other personal data collected during the technical registration process will normally be deleted within a period of seven days.

the subscription to the newsletter can be cancelled by the user at any time. for this purpose, there is a corresponding link in every newsletter.
by doing so, it is also possible to revoke the consent to the storage of personal data collected during the technical registration process.

contact forms are available on our website which can be used for electronic contact. there is the possibility of using a general contact form to address requests or questions of any kind to us, as well as special contact forms that serve, for example, to request offers for our services or to establish a specific press contact. if a user uses one of these options, the data entered in the input mask will be transmitted to us and stored. such data may be the following (depending on the contact form in which certain data may be partly marked as optional in the respective input mask):
at the time the message is sent, the following data is also stored:
your consent is obtained for the processing of the data within the scope of the sending process and reference is made to this privacy statement.
alternatively, you can contact us via one of the email addresses provided. in this case, the user’s personal data transmitted by email will be stored.
in this context, the data will not be passed on to third parties. the data is used exclusively for processing the conversation.

the legal basis for the processing of data is art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. a gdpr to the extent the user has provided his or her consent.
the legal basis for the processing of data transmitted in the course of sending an email or made known to us by telephone is art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. f gdpr.
if the contact is aimed at the conclusion of a contract, the additional legal basis for the processing is art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. b gdpr.

the processing of personal data from the respective input mask serves us solely for the purpose of treating the contact established by the user. in case of contact by email, this also constitutes the necessary legitimate interest in the processing of the data.
the other personal data processed during the sending process serves to prevent misuse of the contact button/form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.

the data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. this is the case for the personal data entered into the input mask of the con­tact form and the data transmitted by email or telephone, when the respective con­ver­sa­tion with the user has ended. the conversation is terminated when it can be assumed according to the circumstances that the issues in question have been finally clarified.
the additional personal data collected during the sending process will be deleted after a period of seven days at the latest.

the user has the possibility to revoke his consent to the processing of personal data at any time. in such a case, the conversation cannot be continued.
the user can revoke his consent and object to the storage of personal data at any time by sending an email to privacy@1nce.com or by writing to our address (1nce gmbh, sternengasse 14-16, 50676 cologne, germany).
all personal data stored in the course of contacting us will be deleted in this case.
the foregoing does not apply on an exceptional basis if there is a concrete suspicion that the user in question might have acted illegally in the context of making contact (e.g. in the case of offensive or other statements that violate personal rights) and a continued storage of the data concerned is at least directly permitted by art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. f gdpr.

you have the opportunity to send us an unsolicited application or to apply for advertised positions. you can use our online application tool to submit your application. in addition to your general contact details, you can also upload your cv, certificates, cover letter, application photo and other documents and send them to us. the transmission of your data within the framework of the online application tool is encrypted. the data is stored in a database.
alternatively, you can also send us your application by e-mail to jobs@1nce.com. please note, however, that in this case your data will be transmitted to us unencrypted.

the legal basis for processing your personal data as part of the application process is art. 88 ds-gvo in conjunction with. § 26 bdsg.

we only use your personal data to carry out the application process.

if you apply for a specific job and do not receive an acceptance for it, we delete your data 90 days after the end of the application process, unless you have given us your express consent pursuant to art. 6 (1) a) ds-gvo to include your person in our talent pool and for our company to contact you in the event of job offers that are of interest to you.
in this case, we will store your application data until you revoke your consent. your consent is voluntary and you have the right to revoke it at any time, without giving reasons, with effect for the future. upon receipt of your revocation, we will delete your personal data, provided that they are not subject to any statutory retention periods.

our website is hosted on the server of a hosting provider (currently: hetzner online gmbh) in the federal republic of germany. the personal data processed by us and described in detail in sections i. to iv. above is stored on this server. all our systems are encrypted according to the state of the art. therefore, access to personal data by the hosting provider should normally hardly be possible. nevertheless, we have concluded a data processing agreement with the hosting provider as a precautionary measure.
