on this website, the controller has integrated components of youtube. youtube is an internet video portal that enables video publishers to set video clips and other users free of charge, which also provides free viewing, review and commenting on them. youtube allows you to publish all kinds of videos, so you can access both full movies and tv broadcasts, as well as music videos, trailers, and videos made by users via the internet portal. the operating company of youtube is youtube, llc, 901 cherry ave., san bruno, ca 94066, united states. the youtube, llc is a subsidiary of google inc., 1600 amphitheatre pkwy, mountain view, ca 94043-1351, united states. with each call-up to one of the individual pages of this internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which a youtube component (youtube video) was integrated, the internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding youtube component. further information about youtube may be obtained under https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/en/. during the course of this technical procedure, youtube and google gain knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject. if the data subject is logged in on youtube, youtube recognizes with each call-up to a sub-page that contains a youtube video, which specific sub-page of our internet site was visited by the data subject. this information is collected by youtube and google and assigned to the respective youtube account of the data subject. youtube and google will receive information through the youtube component that the data subject has visited our website, if the data subject at the time of the call to our website is logged in on youtube; this occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on a youtube video or not. if such a transmission of this information to youtube and google is not desirable for the data subject, the delivery may be prevented if the data subject logs off from their own youtube account before a call-up to our website is made. youtube’s data protection provisions, available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/, provide information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by youtube and google.

art. 6(1) lit. a gdpr serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. if the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on article 6(1) lit. b gdpr. the same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on art. 6(1) lit. c gdpr. in rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. this would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. then the processing would be based on art. 6(1) lit. d gdpr. finally, processing operations could be based on article 6(1) lit. f gdpr. this legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the european legislator. he considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (recital 47 sentence 2 gdpr).

where the processing of personal data is based on article 6(1) lit. f gdpr our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.

the criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. after expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.
requirement necessary to enter into a contract; obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data. we clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. the data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. the non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. the employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.

as a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling. this privacy policy has been generated by the privacy policy generator of the dgd – your external dpo that was developed in cooperation with german lawyers from wilde beuger solmecke, cologne
