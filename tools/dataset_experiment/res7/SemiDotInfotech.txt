Discuss Your Project With The Specialists.
Our clients' satisfaction is our end goal, we take pride in most of our clients being our long-term clients.
When you hire SemiDot Infotech, we will take care of everything that revolves in and around your project.
Global Recognition.
We have worked with some globally recognized brands and created perfectly scaled web and mobile apps for them.
Client Testimonial.
I was pretty skeptical about outsourcing my project to a different country, but SemiDot proved to be even better than some of the companies I have worked with, within Europe.
The prices they quoted were pretty decent, so I took the leap, and they delivered perfectly, and in time, what they promised.
Muhanad.
Me and Harry (Business head of SDI) clicked instantly, thanks to our common passion towards Blockchain.
They are currently working on a blockchain-based game for our company.
Overall, Semidot Infotech is a complete package, low prices combined with top quality.
Carol.
A Great design requires a team of enthusiasts, and these guys delivered exactly what I hoped for.
Looking forward to continuing my partnership with Semidot Infotech.
Give this company a try, as soon as you see their portfolio, you will know exactly what I had been talking about.
Bobby.
Outsourcing a multi-million-euro project to a small company in India.
You guys must be thinking I am joking.
Well, I am not, Semidot Infotech is the complete package you would want for your project, they are truly client-centric, something which is very hard to find in today’s world.
Neil Degg.
We are doctors, and passionate about what we do, so one fine day, we decided to get an app for pregnancy needs.
We came across Semidot through a friend who had previously worked with them, they delivered the app in just 2.
5 months, which is something truly incredible.
Jamil & Idries.
So, I came up with a one of a kind idea, and when most web development companies told me that’s impossible in your budget, these guys proved to be my saviours.
They not only made the web app per the requirements, but also scaled it, to be used by millions of users, and did all of it, in my budget.
Siegfried Gretzinger.
The primary goal behind my project was to take my business online, and I really didn’t expect or anticipate this much response from my customers.
I have dealt with many web development companies in the past, and I can easily say that they have the expertise and resources to develop a good application.
Mario Thaler.
My idea was brought to life with the help of these guys, it is all thanks to them, that my business could take off so smoothly.
SemiDot has proved to be a great business partner, and Kapil (CTO of the company) has proved to be one of the greatest mentors I have ever come across.
