International data transfers.
When we transfer personal information from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or from Switzerland to the United States or other countries which have not been determined by the European Commission to have laws that provide an adequate level of data protection, we use legal mechanisms, including contracts, designed to help ensure your rights and protections.
Specifically, our website servers are located in the United States and our affiliates, partners, third parties and service providers operate in the United States, United Kingdom, European Economic Area, Canada, Singapore, India, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Australia, amongst others.
This means when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any of these countries.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
The safeguard Confluent primarily relies upon is the European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses.

However, we will normally collect personal information only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will indicate this at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences, if any, if you do not provide your personal information).
Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), we will indicate to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have questions about the legal basis for processing or want to find out more, please contact us using the details at the end of this Privacy Policy in the section "How to Contact Us".
Retention.
We retain personal information for as long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so.
For example, we retain your account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with Products you have requested or authorized, including maintaining and improving the performance of the Products and protecting system security.
We also retain personal data as needed to maintain appropriate business and financial records, protect our legal interests, resolve disputes, or comply with legal or regulatory requirements.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will store your personal information using appropriate security measures and take appropriate steps designed to isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
