Cookies.
The websites of CSB use cookies.
Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.
Many websites and servers use cookies.
Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID.
A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.
It consists of a character string through which websites and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored.
This allows accessed websites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies.
A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
Through the use of cookies CSB can provide the users with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind.
Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users.
The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website.
The user of a website that uses cookies, e.
g.
does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user’s computer system.
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
Furthermore, cookies already set may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs.

The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.

Data protection regulations as to the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function).
The controller responsible for processing has integrated the Google Analytics component (with anonymization function) in this website.
Google Analytics is a web analysis service.
Web analysis is the acquisition, collection and evaluation of data on the behavior of visitors of websites.
A web analysis service collects data from which website the data subject has accessed a website (so-called referrers), which sub-pages of the website were accessed or how often and for how long a sub-page was viewed.
A web analysis is mainly used for optimizing a website and for the cost-benefit analysis of web marketing.
The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc.
1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
The controller responsible for processing uses the add-on “_gat.
_anonymizelp” for web analysis via Google Analytics.
By means of this add-on the IP address of the connection to the Internet of the data subject is abbreviated by Google and anonymized, if our websites are accessed by a member state of the European Union or another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
The purpose of the Google Analytics component is the analysis of the flow of visitors of our website.
Google uses inter alia the collected data and information to evaluate the use of our website, to compile online reports for us indicating the activities on our websites, and to render further services related to the use of our website.
Google Analytics sets a cookie into the IT system of the data subject.
The meaning of cookies was already explained above.
Via cookies Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website.
Every single access to one of the individual pages of this website which is operated by the controller responsible for processing and into which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the Internet browser in the IT-system of the data subject is automatically prompted by the respective Google Analytics component to transfer data to Google for the purpose of an online analysis.
In the context of this technical process Google will obtain knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address or the data subject which serve to enable Google to trace the origin of the visitors and clicks and subsequently enable commission settlements.
By means of the cookie personal information, such as the time of access, the location from which the access was made and the access frequency of our website by the data subject will be stored.
Every time our websites are accessed these personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject will be transferred to Google in the United States of America.
These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America.
If need be, Google will disclose the personal data collected via the technical process to a third party.
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent that Google sets a cookie in the IT system of the data subject.
Moreover, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
Moreover, the data subject shall be able to object to and prevent the collection of data generated by Google Analytics, related to the use of this website, as well the processing of these data by Google.
For this the data subject must download and install a browser add-on via the link tools.
google.
com/dlpage/gaoptout.
This browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data or information as to accesses of websites may be transmitted to Google Analytics.
The installation of the browser add-on is considered by Google as an objection.
If the IT-system of the data subject is deleted, formatted or reinstalled at a later stage, the data subject must reinstall the browser add-on to disable Google Analytics.
Provided that the browser add-on has been disabled or deactivated by the data subject or another person to be assigned to his or her sphere of influence, the browser add-on may be reinstalled or reactivated.
Further information and the applicable data protection regulations of Google can be retrieved under  and.

Legal bases of processing.
Art.
6 I lit.
a GDPR shall be the legal basis for processing for which we obtain the consent for a certain processing purpose.
If the processing of personal data for the performance of a contract the data subject is party to, as for instance with processing operations required for the supply of goods or rendering another service or return service, processing shall be based on Art.
6 I lit.
b GDPR.
The same shall be applicable for processing operations required for the performance of pre-contractual measures, for instance in the case of queries regarding our products or services.
If our company is subject to a legal obligation requiring the processing of personal data, such as the compliance with tax duties, the processing shall be based on Art.
6 I lit.
c.
GDPR.
In rare cases, processing of personal data may become necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.
This would for instance be the case if a visitor is injured in our company and as a result his or her name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be forwarded to a physician, hospital or another third party.
Then the processing would be based on Art.
6 I lit.
d GDPR.
In the end the processing operations could be based on Art.
6 I lit.
f GDPR.
Processing operations not covered by any of the aforementioned legal grounds are based on this basis if the processing is necessary to protect a vital interest of our company or a third party, unless interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedom of the data subject prevail.
We are entitled to such processing operations because they are explicitly mentioned by the European legislator.
In this regard the latter’s opinion was that a legitimate interest could be assumed, if the data subject is a customer of the controller (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR).
20.
Legitimate interests in the processing pursued by the controller or a third party.
If the processing or personal data is based on Article 6 I lit.
f GDPR, our legitimate interest will be the performance of our business activities in favor of the welfare of our staff members and our shareholders.
21.
Storage period of personal data.
The criterion for the storage period of personal data shall be the respective legal retention period.
Upon expiry of the period the respective data shall be routinely deleted, provided that they are no longer necessary for the performance of the contract or contract initiation.
22.
Legal or contractual provisions for the provision of personal data.
necessity for the conclusion of a contract.
obligation of the data subject to provide personal data.
possible consequences of a non-provision.
We inform you that the provision of personal data is partly prescribed by law (e.
g.
tax regulations) or may be a result of contractual provisions (e.
g.
information on the contractual partner).
From time to time it may be necessary for the conclusion of a contract that a data subject provides us with personal data which subsequently must be processed by us.
The data subject shall be obliged to provide personal data, if our company enters into a contract with him or her.
The non-provision of personal data would mean that the contract with the data subject cannot be concluded.
Prior to the provision of personal data by the data subject the latter must contact one of our staff members.
Our staff member informs the data subject on a case-by-case basis whether the provision of personal data is prescribed by law or contract or necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide personal data and what consequences would have to be expected if personal data are not provided.
