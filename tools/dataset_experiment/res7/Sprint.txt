and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
We may combine the Personal Information we collect for the above purposes.
We will not collect additional categories of Personal Information, nor use the Personal Information collected for additional purposes, without providing you notice.
What Personal Information We Sell or Share.
The CCPA defines “sale” very broadly to include sharing or disclosing of personal information with a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.
There are a number of circumstances where we are allowed to share personal information with third parties which are not considered to be a sale.
For example, we may share personal information with service providers who work on our behalf if the service provider agrees not to use that personal information for other purposes.
In addition, you may intentionally direct us to share information with a third-party, which is also not a sale.
Currently we have one program, which would be considered a sale under the CCPA.
This program does not directly identify you but allows a third party to aggregate the data and issue de-identified marketing and analytics reports.
If you do not wish for us to use your information to produce de-identified and aggregated data sets in the reports we share with third parties, you may opt out at any time.
Take a look at our Reporting & Analytics Program Policy for details.
We may share the Personal Information identified in the chart above with the following categories of third parties.
Affiliates - We may share personal and non-personal information with affiliated entities for approved business purposes.
The data may include credit-related, payment history and transactional information.
View Sprint's Financial Privacy Notice for more details.
Service providers - We may share personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf.
Credit bureaus and similar regulated entities, that we use as part of processing your application and determining eligibility for our services, may incorporate the personal information we submit as part of our inquiry into their databases.
They may use the personal information that we submit for other purposes consistent with applicable law.
Group Account Holders - We offer group accounts to business and government customers, family customers and other group account holders ("Group Accounts").
The account holder for Group Accounts is the entity or person that buys the service or product for its employees, family members or other authorized users.
You (as the user of a device) may receive service, certain pricing, terms or other benefits through a Group Account with us.
If so, we may share with that Group Account holder customer registration and other information related to your use of our services.
Relationship, Discount, and Reward Programs - We may share limited personal information (e.
g.
, name, address, telephone number, account status/active or inactive, membership number) with non-Sprint entities when you sign up for a discount or reward program, including when you sign up for a service discount through the Sprint Discount Program, for eligibility verification, fulfillment, and administrative purposes.
Third Party Verification Services - We may share limited personal information (e.
g.
, address, phone number) with non-Sprint entities to assist with identity verification, and to prevent fraud and identity theft.
Other Third Parties with your consent - We may share information with other third parties with your consent.
For example, you may agree to our sharing your information with other third parties to hear about their products and services.
Use of the information you agree to share will be subject to those third parties' separate privacy policies.
This may include sharing information collected in connection with financial products or services, such as installment billing.
View Sprint's Financial Privacy Notice for more details.
Disclosures to Third Party Applications and Service Providers - We may share information with other third parties with your consent.
For example, you may agree to our sharing your information with other third parties to hear about their products and services.
Use of the information you agree to share will be subject to those third parties' separate privacy policies.
This may include sharing information collected in connection with financial products or services, such as installment billing.
View Sprint's Financial Privacy Notice for more details.
Business Transfers Personal information about you may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets or transition of service to another provider.
In the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, personal information may also be transferred as a business asset.
As we believe to be necessary or appropriate.
(a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence.
(b) to comply with legal process.
(c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence.
(d) to enforce our terms and conditions.
(e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates.
(f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others.
and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
Sprint does not sell Personal Information of minors under 16 years of age (as defined by the CCPA).
Your Rights under the CCPA.
You have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect, use, disclose, and sell.
You have the right to request deletion of any personal information about you that we have collected from you.
You have a right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.
You have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for your exercise of your privacy rights and we would not do so.
How to Submit a Data Privacy Request.
To submit a request for access, deletion, or opt-out, please complete the online request form by visiting  or 1-866-429-1055.
Verification of Your Identity.
For your protection—to prevent unauthorized access to data and ensure that you’re the person who is making the request—we must verify your identity before we can fulfill your request for access or deletion.
To learn more about our verification process, please read our FAQs.
If we are unable to verify your identity, your request will be denied.
Responding to Your Requests.
Please note that we may not be required to delete information under certain circumstances.
For example, the CCPA includes exemptions that provide that we do not have to delete data that for example, is necessary to complete a transaction, detect security incidents, or for certain other internal purposes.
