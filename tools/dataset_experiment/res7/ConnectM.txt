It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
‍Cookies‍A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website.
When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser.
Cookies may store user preferences and other information.
You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.
Data TagsA data tag is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, application, or device.
Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Data tags can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising.
For example, data tags stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language.
You can configure your browser to refuse all or certain types of cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
On other platforms besides browsers, data tags are used to recognize a specific device or application on that device.

Data tags may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a smartphone.
For example, a device’s data tag can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.

‍Web Storage‍Web Storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device.
