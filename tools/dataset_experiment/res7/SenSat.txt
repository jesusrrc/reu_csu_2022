7.
How Do We Use Your Data.
Under the Data Protection Legislation, we must always have a lawful basis for collecting and using personal data.
The following table describes how we may use your personal data, and our lawful basis for doing so.
We may process any of your personal data where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal proceedings.
In such a scenario, the legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, by virtue of protecting and asserting our legal rights, your legal rights and, if required, the legal rights of others.
In addition to the specific purposes for which we may process your personal data set out above, we may also process any of your personal data where such processing is necessary for compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject (such as anti-money laundering obligations).
We will only use your personal data for the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected and the purposes explained in this Privacy Notice unless we reasonably believe that another purpose is compatible with that or those purpose(s) and need to use your personal data for that purpose.
If we do use your personal data in this way and you wish us to explain how the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us using the details in Part 15.
If we need to use your personal data for a purpose that is unrelated to, or incompatible with, the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, we will inform you and explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
In some circumstances, where permitted or required by law, we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent.
This will only be done within the bounds of the Data Protection Legislation and your legal rights.
8.
How Long Will You Keep My Personal Data.
We will not keep your personal data for any longer than is necessary for our ongoing legitimate business needs, whether that be to provide you with the services requested or for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
Notwithstanding the above, we may retain your personal data where such retention is required for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.
9.
How and Where Do You Store or Transfer My Personal Data.
Your personal data and files are stored on Sensat servers and the servers of our third party providers we hire to provide services to us.
Your personal data may be transferred outside the UK because we have servers located worldwide, we may need to transfer to our Group Companies outside of the UK, and the companies we hire to help us run our business are located in different countries around the world.
We will however not routinely transfer your personal data to, or store it, outside of the United Kingdom.
If we do happen to store or transfer any of your data outside the United Kingdom, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that it is protected and transferred in a manner consistent with applicable legal requirements.
This may be done in a number of different ways, for instance.
the country that we send the data to might be approved based on ‘adequacy regulations’ enacted under the UK GDPR as offering an adequate level of protection for personal data.
the recipient might have signed up to a contract based on "Standard Contractual Clauses" approved under the UK GDPR or by the European Commission and the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, obliging them to protect your personal data.
or.
in other circumstances, the law may permit us to otherwise transfer your personal data outside the United Kingdom.
The security of your personal data is essential to us, and to protect your data, we take a number of important measures, including the following.
limiting access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties who have a legitimate need to know and ensuring that they are subject to duties of confidentiality at all times.
Sensat employees are required to follow all applicable laws and regulations, including in relation to data protection laws.
procedures for dealing with data breaches (the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, your personal data) including notifying you and/or the Information Commissioner’s Office where we are legally required to do so.
When you contact us about your file, you may be asked for some personal data.
This is a safeguard designed to ensure that only you, or someone authorised by you, has access to your file with us.
It is important to remember that the transmission of data via the internet may not be entirely safe or secure and you are therefore advised to take and put in place suitable precautions when transmitting data to us via the internet.
10.
Do You Share My Personal Data.
We may need to share your data if doing so is reasonably necessary to provide a service that you have required, provided that we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data will be handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, our obligations and the obligations of any applicable and relevant third party under the law.
In particular, we may need to share your personal data with third party agents and contractors for the purposes of enabling them to provide data analysis, customer support, storage, web hosting, marketing services, security/monitoring services and other services to us and any entity we may appoint from time to time to evaluate the effectiveness of the Sites.
These third parties will be subject to appropriate confidentiality requirements and they will only use your personal data as described in this Privacy Notice.
We may also share your personal data to our Group Companies, and they will only process personal data for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or notified to you when we collect your personal data.
If you interact with other users of our Sites, those users may see and, in certain cases, potentially share, your name, profile picture/photo, and descriptions of your activity, including sending invitations to other users and chatting with other users.
If we sell, transfer, or merge all or parts of our business or assets, any relevant personal data of yours may be transferred to a third party as part of, and within the context, of such a sale, transfer or merger.

Likewise, we may compile statistics about the use of our Site (including data relating to traffic, usage patterns and user behaviour and numbers).
We may from time to time share any such data with third parties (including, but not limited to, potential investors, affiliates and partners), provided that any and all such data will only be shared in accordance with, and within the limits of, applicable law.
In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain personal data, which might include your own, for example if we are involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court order, or the instructions of a government authority and/or where the disclosure of your personal data is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation.
(ii) for the establishing, exercise or defence of legal claims or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.
11.
How Can I Control My Personal Data.

There are places within the Sites that allow you to upload or otherwise share content, models, comments, and to communicate with others.
