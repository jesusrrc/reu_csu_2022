Valarm™ Privacy Policy.
Last Updated November 24, 2012.
Valarm™ is concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and disclose Personally Identifiable Information when you use our sites or applications.
This Privacy Statement (the “Privacy Statement”) describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through our products and applications, through a user account registered on valarm.
net or when you interact with our support personnel.
To the extent that we process information for which opt-in consent is required under applicable laws, we will ask you for such opt-in consent.
You may withdraw this opt-in consent at any time.
Other Valarm™ sites, or certain activities on other sites relating to Valarm™, are governed by privacy practices different from those set forth below.
We encourage you to check the privacy statement of each Valarm™ site that you visit.
To learn about our general online practices, go to .
1.
WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DOES VALARM™ COLLECT.
We gather two basic types of information.
“Personally Identifiable Information” (“PII”) and “Non-Personally Identifiable Information” (“Non-PII”).
A.
Personally Identifiable Information.
We collect PII used in conjunction with your Valarm™  account or when you contact our customer service center, such as your name, address, telephone numbers, email address, or account details.
We may combine the information that you submit under your account with information we collect from our products or applications or that we receive from third parties, in order to provide you applications and services and to improve the quality of our products and applications.
We may also collect PII when you use our products or applications or enable certain features on one of our products or applications.
Such PII may include location information collected from wireless devices or from cell towers.
You may also voluntarily provide PII when you provide points of interest feedback, reviews, or comments on Valarm™ licensed content.
B.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
Valarm™ also collects Non-PII from personal mobile device.
If a mobile device is not registered on valarm.
net, information collected is not associated with any particular user and thus is non-PII.
For instance, Valarm™ may collect information relating to how often a device is turned on and for how long or the frequency with which certain applications and features of the product or service are used.
Valarm™ may also collect information, including but not limited to, relating to which advertisements were viewed, how often they were clicked and how often certain actions were taken.
When you use Valarm™ products and applications or access your account on valarm.
net, we automatically record log information.
These server logs may include information such as, including but not limited to, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, the time(s) of your visit(s) and the web page(s) that you visited.
Under certain laws, this log information may be considered PII.
2.
VALARM’S USE OF INFORMATION.
A.
Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
We may use PII about you for the purposes listed below.
If we intend to use PII about you for a purpose that is incompatible with these purposes or if we intend to disclose PII about you to a type of third party not previously identified in this Privacy Statement, we will notify you and offer you the opportunity to opt out of such use and/or disclosure.
(i) General.
We and our service providers use PII in order to allow you to utilize the Valarm™ Service and to allow you to update the software on your device or to respond to a customer service request.
We may also use PII about you for internal business purposes, such as to gauge customer satisfaction and to improve our products and services.
(ii) Location Information.
Your physical location, or the physical location of your device(s) is/are collected using satellites, wi-fi networks, and cell phone towers in order to provide you with certain location-based services to enhance our products and applications.
(iii) Track logs.
When you connect your device to the internet, and if you provide consent, you may upload from your device to Valarm™ certain historical information, including, but not limited to, location information that is stored on your device, which we and our third party application and content providers will use to enhance our and their products and applications.
(Depending on your configuration the uploaded information can, but does not have to, include environmental information, including but not limited to any of the following.
current location, ambient light levels, noise levels, pictures, temperature, humidity, various vehicle data such as revolutions per minute, engine data.
).
(iv) Communications.
We may use PII about you to send you information about Valarm’s programs, invite you to participate in special programs, re-contact you if we have not heard from you in a while and, occasionally, electronically send you advertising/promotional material about Valarm™ and selected partner products and applications.
You may opt out of receiving certain future marketing information or promotional communications (see Section 8 (Opt-Out/Choice) below).
However, regardless of your opt-out preferences, Valarm™ may still at times need to send emails for administrative or transactional reasons (e.
g.
, to provide you with important information regarding valarm.
net or a product or service, or changes to our terms of use, and policies).
Because this information may be important to your use of valarm.
net or our products and applications, you may not opt out of receiving such communications.

and information relating to a support or service issue.
(viii) Compliance with Applicable Law.
We may need to collect and retain PII about you in order to comply with applicable laws and to respond to requests from public authorities, including public authorities outside your country of residence.
B.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose.
Valarm™ collects non-PII from devices, including but not limited to, devices that are not registered on valarm.
net and thus are not associated with any PII.
We may use this information to detect broad demographic trends and to otherwise enhance our products or applications.
We reserve the right to share such Non-PII, which does not personally identify you, with third parties, for any purpose.
In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII (such as combining your name with your zip code).
If we do combine any Non-PII with PII, we will treat the combined information as PII for as long as it is combined.
C.
Server Log Information.
We and our service providers use server log information including IP addresses for purposes such as calculating site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with valarm.
net servers, administering valarm.
net and for the other purposes set forth in Section 2(A), and we may disclose IP addresses as set forth in Section 3 below.
Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.
Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files, and related information as Non-PII, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable laws.
