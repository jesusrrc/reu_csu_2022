Bill of Rights.
On the 8th of September 2013 Limor Fried founder and lead engineer of Adafruit Industries called in the New York Times for a Bill of Rights for the Internet of Things with the following core principals.
Open is better than closed.
this ensures portability between Internet of Things devices.
Consumers, not companies, own the data collected by Internet of Things devices.
Internet of Things devices that collect public data must share that data.
Users have the right to keep their data private.
Users can delete or back up data collected by Internet of Things devices.
Arguing that these were all reasonable consumer rights, and that smart companies will adopt these as the standard, and that open-source code and hardware will help keep abuses low and security strong when everything is connected to the Internet.
Your rights.
We agree with the Bill of Rights for your things.
They're your things.
You own them, you control them.
All our code is open to download and review, and is available under an open source license.
Your data is stored locally with your steward, and is stored in standard SQL databases so it can be easily exported from our system, and it is private by default.
You choose how and when to release your data.
It will never leave your local network unless you want it to, our cloud services are designed to let you access your steward and your data remotely, not to publicise your data.
We claim no ownership over your data, your data is yours, and our philiosophy is all about making things as easy as possible for you to keep it that way.
Licensing.
Software.
