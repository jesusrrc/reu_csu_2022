How Will You Verify My Identity.
For your privacy and security, and to prevent fraud and other harmful activities, when we receive a request through one of the Communication Methods, we need to ensure that the person submitting the request is the person they purport to be.
Accordingly, we may take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the person submitting the request.
Verification is typically a two-step process.
First, we ask you to provide identifying information when you submit a request, whether through our web form, toll-free telephone number, mail, or other approved Communication Method.
This information will include your first name, middle name, last name, email address, shipping address and telephone number.
Providing accurate information that matches our records is the first step in helping us to identify the correct information, verify the validity of the request, and protect your data.
In the second step of verification, we may ask you to submit evidence proving your identity.
You may submit this information along with your request or after your request.
The evidence we may request from you, and the degree of certainty we will be required to reach regarding your identity and the authenticity of your request, will depend upon the nature of your request, the nature of the information we have about you, and your ability to furnish information.
For requests of specific pieces of personal information about a consumer, we will verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty.
whereas for requests to know the categories of personal information collected and used about a consumer, we will verify identity to a reasonable degree of certainty.
We may ask you to submit a signed statement and a redacted copy of identifying information (such as a government-issued ID), or to submit a signed, notarized statement.
If we ask you to verify your identity, you must promptly cooperate with our efforts so that we can fulfill your request.
If you do not comply, your request cannot be fulfilled.
and if you delay in complying, the fulfillment of your request is likely to be delayed as a result.
