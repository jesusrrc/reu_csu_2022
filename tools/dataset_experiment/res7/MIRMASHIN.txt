The GDPR may apply to certain activities of Management Recruiters International, Inc.

This data enables us and our customers to consider you for a franchise purchase, employment or engagement opportunities and to operate our business and to service our customers.
Most of this data is provided by you directly when you contact us about purchasing a franchise, our services, submit a resume or application, attend a recruiting event, or through email and phone conversations with us, or during your employment or other business relationship with us.

screening data, including drug, alcohol, and criminal background checks.
the identity of your references and information provided by them.
bank account, financial and employee benefits data.
and.
information about physical or mental health, disability status and leaves of absence.
We also collect data about individuals who are employed or engaged by our customers, service providers and suppliers in connection with our providing staffing, outsourcing and other services to customers.

You are entitled to request that we correct inaccuracies (rectification) of your personal data.
In response to your request, we will update any incomplete or inaccurate personal data we hold about you to ensure it is accurate and correct.
• Erasure.
You have the right to request erasure of your personal data in certain circumstances, subject to (a) our obligations to maintain your information under applicable laws, (b) if retention of your personal data is required in connection with claims, or (c) for other reasons expressly set forth in this Privacy Statement.
