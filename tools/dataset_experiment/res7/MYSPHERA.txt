This Privacy Policy provides information on our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from (1) Companies and individuals who use the service provided by us and (2) visitors who simply browse the Web Site.
By using or accessing the Service in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.
Remember that your use of the Service is at all times subject to the Terms of Service, which incorporates this Privacy Policy.

1.
What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Collect It.
At various times, you could be asked to provide information such as your name, email address, contact phone number or other information.
Information collected is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable.
Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual.
For instance, we may know that thousands of people have visited this Privacy Policy, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth.
What we collect from visits such as this constitutes anonymous information.
Some of the individuals who access our Services decline to use the personalization features that are available to them, and therefore those individuals are anonymous to us and the only data we collect about them is anonymous information.
