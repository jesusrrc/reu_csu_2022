REACH.
Variscite produces “Articles” as defined in REACH regulation and not chemicals which need to be registered according to the REACH regulation.
There is no intended release of substances subjected to REACH and therefore registration does not apply to our products.
The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) Candidate List of the Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) is monitored regularly by Variscite with its approved suppliers.
As far as we know, our products do not currently contain any of these SVHCs in a concentration above 0.
1% of the weight of the product.

Conflict Minerals.
We have received several inquiries from our customers in respect to the Conflict Minerals issue addresses in Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was passed by the US Congress in July 2010.
Variscite does not purchase 3T&G directly from smelters or mines, so we must rely on the source information provided by our suppliers.
We will continue to assess the conflict status of our supply chain and, if identified, will eliminate the use of supplier materials that include 3T&G from conflict sources as soon as commercially practicable.
