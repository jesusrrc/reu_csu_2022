We have set out in this document our basic terms and conditions (together with any conditions contained in the quotation, if any, we previously furnished to you, "Terms") that will exclusively govern the sale of our products (“Products” and each, a “Product”) to you (any such sale, a "Transaction").
If you provide us with any pre-printed terms and conditions that appear on any purchase order or other form document, they are rejected and will be of no force or effect.
These Terms are deemed a part of and incorporated by reference into all other documents exchanged between us relating to the sale and purchase of our Products, whether electronic or in writing, including, without limitation, all quotations, acknowledgements, packing slips, invoices and purchase orders.
APPLICATION OF TERMS.
Our acknowledgement and acceptance of your order for our Products is expressly limited to and made conditional upon your acceptance of these Terms.
We deem material, object to and reject any of your terms and conditions that are in addition to or different from these Terms unless we have expressly agreed to them in writing (other than additional provisions specifying quantity and shipping instructions).
Unless otherwise agreed in writing, we will deem you to have waived any objection to these Terms if we have not received written notice of such objection within ten (10) days of the date of your order.
In any event, you will be deemed to have agreed to these Terms if you accept any portion of the Products you order from us.
WARRANTY.
DISCLAIMERS.
We warrant that the Products furnished hereunder will be furnished in accordance with the functional specifications set forth or incorporated by express reference on the face of any offer, acceptance or order acknowledgement (as the case may be) issued by us that incorporates these Terms by reference, subject to availability of suitable power and fluid supplies and installation by a suitably qualified installer in line with our instructions.
Routine test instructions must be followed.
We offer a twenty-four (24) month limited warranty against defects in manufacturing from the date you receive the Products (“Warranty”).
HOWEVER, NO WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE NOR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IS MADE RESPECTING SAID PRODUCTS, OR THE PRODUCTION THEREOF AND THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES WHICH EXTEND BEYOND THE AFOREMENTIONED WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFICATIONS SET FORTH OR INCORPORATED BY EXPRESS REFERENCE ON THE FACE OF ANY OFFER, ACCEPTANCE OR ORDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (AS THE CASE MAY BE) ISSUED BY US THAT INCORPORATES THESE STANDARD TERMS BY EXPRESS REFERENCE.
ANY TECHNICAL ADVICE PROVIDED BY US WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF PRODUCTS SOLD HEREUNDER SHALL BE FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, AND WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY NOR ASSUME ANY OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY FOR ANY SUCH ADVICE.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER IS PROVIDED WITH RESPECT TO ANY PRODUCTS SOLD ON AN ‘AS IS’ BASIS.
Products must be installed by suitably qualified, registered installers.
We strongly recommend that you do not book a plumber, electrician, builder or any other installer until all Products have been delivered and checked.

Your sole and exclusive remedy against us for any breach of our obligations in a Transaction or based on any other theory of liability will be limited to, at our option, our repair or replacement of any nonconforming Product for which you make a claim or our issuance of a credit for such nonconforming Product in accordance with these Terms, the Warranty and any instructions we may give you for the return of the Product or otherwise.
You must obtain a return authorization from us and give us a reasonable opportunity to inspect the Product and confirm the nonconformity.
This exclusive remedy will not be deemed to have failed of its essential purpose so long as we are willing and able to repair or replace the nonconforming Product and, in any event, our liability for any damages due will be limited to the price paid by you for the nonconforming Products, regardless of whether other damages were foreseeable.
