DATA CONTROLLER AND DATA PROCESSOR.
Waylay does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Customer Data stored or processed by a Customer or User via the Service.
Only the Customer or Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Customer Data.
Waylay is largely unaware of what Customer Data is actually being stored or made available by a Customer or User to the Service and does not directly access such Customer Data except as authorized by the Customer, or as necessary to provide Services to the Customer and its Users.
Because Waylay does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Customer Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, Waylay is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereinafter “GDPR”) and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR.
Waylay should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Customers and Users as to any Customer Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of the GDPR.
Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Waylay does not independently cause Customer Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of Waylay in connection with Waylay’s provision of Services to Customers.
Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Customer or User.
The Customer or the User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Customer Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data.
Waylay is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Customer Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors’ servers) at the discretion of the Customer or User nor is Waylay responsible for the manner in which the Customer or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information.
