Information We Collect.
You are free to explore the Websites without providing any Personal Information.
When you visit the Websites, we may request that you provide Personal Information, and we collect Navigational Information.
Often you are able to choose what information you provide, but from time to time we may require certain information in order to provide the Services.
Personal Information.
“Personal Information” means any information that you voluntarily submit to us and that identifies you personally, including contact information, such as your name, e-mail address, company name, address, phone number, and other information about yourself or your business.
Personal Information can also include information about any transactions, both free and paid, that you enter into on the Websites.
Personal Information may further include your IP address or other Navigational Information discussed further below if applicable.
Navigational Information.
“Navigational Information” means information about your computer and your visits to the Websites such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and pages viewed.
Please see the “Navigational Information” section below.
Content.
We collect and store Content that you create, input, submit, post, upload, transmit, store or display in the process of using our products, services or Websites.
Such Content includes any Personal Information or other sensitive information that you choose to include (“passively-collected Personal Information”).
Analytics Information.
We and our analytics provider collect and store analytics information when you use our Websites and/or our products and services to help us improve our Websites, products and services.
This analytics information consists of web browsing behavior collected through a combination of HTTP beacons and cookies.
Analytics information also consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against Content across our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data.
“Usage Data” is aggregated data about a group or category of services, features or users that does not contain Personal Information.
Though we may happen upon sensitive or Personal Information as we compile Usage Data from Content across user instances, this is a byproduct of our efforts to understand broader patterns and trends.
It is not a concerted effort by us to examine the Content of any particular customer.
Some of our products contain a feature that sends information about the version of the products on your systems (“System Information”) to us.
System Information includes information about (i) the server environment in which the product is operating.
OS type and version, language and locale settings.
(ii) user client information, for example.
browser type and version, native client type and version, and client device specifications (e.
g.
screen resolution, OS version, device type, etc.
).
You can disable our collection of analytics information from products via the administrator settings or by blocking collection at the local network level.

Tulip’s Customers may electronically submit data or information to the Services for hosting and processing purposes (“Customer Data”).

If you wish to make your request directly to Tulip, please provide the name of the Tulip customer who submitted your data to our Services.
We will refer your request to that customer, and will support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
Customer-Generated Content and Applications.
Without limiting the generality of this Privacy Policy, in addition to information gathered through its Web sites or submitted to its Services, Tulip may obtain Personal Information through Customer-Generated Applications running on the Tulip Player (“Customer-Generated Applications”) that Customers or their authorized individuals (“Users”) create and run on customer or user devices (“Devices”).
Customer-Generated Applications may obtain information from, or access data stored on, Devices to provide services related to the relevant Customer-Generated Application.

Information accessed or obtained by the Customer-Generated Application on a Device may be accessible to the Customer and its organization, depending on the intended functionality of the Customer-Generated Application.

If Device’s settings permit, those updates will be downloaded and installed automatically on the Device.
By installing a Tulip Player on your Device, you consent to the downloading and updating of that Tulip Player.
