Privacy Policy.
Fortinet Privacy Policy.
Effective Date.
February 1, 2022.
This is the Privacy Policy of Fortinet, Inc.
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Fortinet,” “we,” “our,” or “us”).
We provide security solutions that help protect the data and systems of our business customers from continually evolving risks.
It is Fortinet’s policy to provide security and privacy.
Each is important, and they are sometimes co-dependent.
We believe in Security by Design and Privacy by Design.
This Privacy Policy covers Fortinet’s handling of two categories of information.
Personal data that our partners and customers ask us to process on their behalf (“Processor Data”).
Fortinet offers security products and services, and related support and professional services (the “Fortinet Services”), including FortiGuard, FortiCare, FortiCloud, FortiSandbox Cloud, and FortiMail Cloud.
With some exceptions as identified below, under applicable law, in certain contexts Fortinet is considered the “processor” of the personal data we receive through the Fortinet Services, and our customer is (or acts on behalf of) the “controller” of the data (i.
e.
, the company with the right to decide how the data is used).
Personal data that we handle for our own business (“Controller Data”), other than for our human resources and recruiting operations.
Under applicable law, Fortinet is a “controller” of this data.
This Privacy Policy includes details specific to Processor Data, details specific to Controller Data, and information relevant to our handling of both kinds of data.
1.
Privacy Practices Specific to Processor Data.
a.
Types of Processor Data We Collect.
We receive information from or on behalf of our customers and their users, and for most of such data, we act as a “processor.
”  Because of the nature of the Fortinet Services, this information may contain any type of personal data.
For example, we may collect the following categories of information, that may be Processor Data, through the Fortinet Services.
Device identifiers, such as IP addresses, device name, model, manufacturer, firmware versions, operating system, metadata, time zone, language, MAC addresses, and other information about computing systems, applications, filenames and file paths, usernames, and technical data about the operating system instructions flow and networks.
Contact details and registration information (including identifiers), such as names, aliases, usernames, emails, age, gender, phone numbers, addresses, and photographs.
Internet or other electronic network or device activity information, such as system logs, traffic, URLs, metadata, and antivirus and other malware statistics.
Other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you, including information contained in files, activity logs, analysis reports, communications content and metadata, distribution lists, and information provided to us through dashboards or portals associated with the security and firewall solutions of the Fortinet Services, such as troubleshooting requests and security inquiries regarding files, systems.
Some of the technical information listed above is considered personal data in certain contexts.
Fortinet also collects Processor Data through the technology described in the “Cookies and Similar Automated Data Collection” section below.
We use Processor Data as described in the following section.
b.
Uses of Processor Data.
Subject to our contractual obligations, and depending on the particular Fortinet Services, we may use and disclose the information described above (sometimes in combination with other information we obtain, such as from our customers) as follows.
To provide the Fortinet Services, including by.
Providing maintenance and technical supportProviding product upgradesAddressing security and business continuity issuesAnalyzing and improving the Fortinet Services, including responding to new threats and developing new features.
Providing maintenance and technical support.
Providing product upgrades.
Addressing security and business continuity issues.
Analyzing and improving the Fortinet Services, including responding to new threats and developing new features.
To enforce the legal terms that govern the Fortinet Services.
To comply with law and protect rights, safety, and property.
For other purposes requested or permitted by our customers or users, or as reasonably required to perform our business.
Many Fortinet Services use automated technology to recognize and defend against cybersecurity risks, such as by blocking or quarantining suspected malicious data.
To better protect our customers and assist them with their own security compliance, some Fortinet Services use external threat information gathered in these situations to improve security for customers of Fortinet Services in similar situations.
For example, if certain Fortinet services determine that a hacker is attacking some of our customers, we may use information about that threat in order to help protect other customers from similar attacks.
This provides our customers’ data with much better protection than what would be possible if our services could not learn from experience.
We handle “Threat Data” like this as described in the “Privacy Practices Specific to Controller Data” section below.
c.
Disclosures of Processor Data.
Subject to our contractual obligations, and depending on the particular Fortinet Services, we may disclose the information described above as follows.
To provide the Fortinet Services, which can involve sharing personal data with our customer and with third parties selected by the customer or its users (for example, to detect security incidents, and protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, we process data about third-party threat actors such as the IP address of certain hacker-controlled devices that attempt cyberattacks on our customers).
To enforce the legal terms that govern the Fortinet Services.
To comply with law, and where we deem disclosure appropriate to protect rights, safety and property (for example, for national security or law enforcement).
As part of an actual or contemplated business sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets or reorganization.
For other purposes requested or permitted by our customers or users, or as reasonably required to perform our business.
For those purposes, we may share information with our affiliates and other entities that help us with the activities described in this Privacy Policy.
2.
Privacy Practices Specific to Controller Data.
a.
Types of Controller Data We Collect.
As described above, we act as a processor for most of the Fortinet Services.
We are, however, a “controller” under applicable law with respect to Controller Data.
Controller Data includes two general categories of data.
Business Data and Threat Data.
For example, we may collect certain data about customers, prospective customers, partners and their personnel (“Business Data”), which may include.
Contact details and professional details, such as name, email address, address, phone number, title and name of company.
Online identifiers, such as IP address and account ID information.
Information about users’ experience with our products, services, events and online forums and communities, such as the Fortinet Developer Network and CTAP end-user reports.
Information about actual or prospective customer personnel’s other interactions with Fortinet, e.
g.
, procurement, customer service, and point of sale data.
Data we handle in connection with the Network Security Expert Institute, the Fortinet Network Security Academy and other training and certification programs, including contact information, identity documents and other personal data collected for authentication of the candidate’s identity and test security, and testing results.
Audio or video information, such recordings of meetings, or photographs collected from certification candidates for identity verification and security checks.
Information about actual or prospective users’ interests.
Financial data, such as payment information for Fortinet products and services.
Investor relations-related data.
Other business-related data collected on our websites (such as online forum registrations) and elsewhere for our own business (such as at events).
We obtain Business Data directly from the relevant individuals or their employers, and also from third-party sources, such as distributors, resellers and partners, credit card issuers, clearinghouses, data brokers, fraud databases, referrals from customers and users, as well as publicly available sources such as company websites.
In connection with some Fortinet Services, Fortinet is also considered a controller of certain personal data relevant to security threats, i.
e.
“Threat Data.
”  To the extent it is personal data, IP addresses, device identifiers, URLs, and other data associated with malicious activity are part of Threat Data.
We obtain Threat Data through Fortinet Services, publicly available sources such as online forums, other security providers and researchers, and independent research.
Fortinet also collects Business Data and Threat Data through the technology described in the Cookies and Similar Automated Data Collection section below.
We use all Controller Data as described in the following section.
b.
Uses of Controller Data (Business Data and Threat Data).
Fortinet uses Controller Data as follows.
To provide our products, services, events, websites, communities, training, certifications, and other business offerings.
For marketing, advertising, and other communications (including customizing and tailoring all of them for the particular recipient).
To manage our relationships with customers, partners, suppliers, event attendees, and others.
For surveys and other market research.
For cybersecurity research.
To analyze, improve, and create Fortinet Services and other business offerings.
To enforce the legal terms that govern our business and online properties.
To provide security and business continuity.
To comply with law and protect rights, safety, and property.
For other purposes requested or permitted by our customers or users, or as reasonably required to perform our business.
c.
Disclosures of Controller Data (Business Data and Threat Data).
Subject to our contractual obligations, we share the information described above as follows.
For the uses of information described above.
As part of an actual or contemplated business sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets or reorganization.
For other purposes requested or permitted by our customers or users, or as reasonably required to perform our business.
For those purposes, we may share information with our affiliates and other entities that help us with the activities described in this Privacy Policy.
d.
Legal Bases for Processing Controller Data (Business Data and Threat Data).
The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data.
To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds for processing Controller Data are as follows.
Legitimate interests.
In most cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in commercial activities such as the following in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals.
Protecting our business, personnel and propertyProviding cybersecurity, including for the protection of personal dataCustomer serviceMarketingAnalyzing and improving our business.
and/orManaging legal issues.
Protecting our business, personnel and property.
Providing cybersecurity, including for the protection of personal data.
Customer service.
Marketing.
Analyzing and improving our business.
and/or.
Managing legal issues.
We may also process personal data for the same legitimate interests of our customers and business partners.
To honor our contractual commitments to the individual.
Some of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the individuals’ request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them.
Consent.
Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent.
Where legally required (e.
g.
, for the use of fingerprints for security purposes in certain jurisdictions), this is explicit consent.
Legal compliance.
We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.
3.
Additional Information About Our Privacy Practices (applicable to both Processor Data and Controller Data).
a.
Personal Data Rights and Choices (including Direct Marketing Opt-Out).
We offer the options described below for exercising rights and choices under applicable law.
Many of these are subject to important limits or exceptions under applicable law.
To exercise rights or choices with respect to Processor Data, please make your request directly to the Fortinet customer for whom we process the data, particularly if the self-service options described below do not fully resolve your concern.
You may review and update certain user information by logging in to the relevant portions of the Fortinet Services or Fortinet websites or online services.
In addition, the law of your jurisdiction (for example, within the European Economic Area) may give you additional rights to request access to and rectification or erasure of certain of your personal data we hold.
In some cases, you may be entitled to receive a copy of the personal data you provided to us in portable form or to request that we transmit it to a third party.
The law may also give you the right to request restrictions on the processing of your personal data, to object to processing of your personal data, or to withdraw consent for the processing of your personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect).
You may contact us as described below to make these requests.
For example, residents of the European Economic Area and certain other jurisdictions have a right to opt out of our processing of Controller Data for direct marketing purposes.
You can exercise this right by contacting us as described below.
Our marketing emails and certain other communications include unsubscribe instructions, which you can use to limit or stop the relevant communications.
Opt-out processes may take some time to complete, consistent with applicable law.
Certain communications (such as certain billing-related communications or emergency service messages) are not subject to opt-out.
Many Fortinet Services are designed to block hacking and other unauthorized activity, and they use automated means to compare user activity or device traits to similar data points that been associated with hacking or other unauthorized activity.
If you believe that our services have been used to block you in error, please contact the relevant Fortinet customer for assistance.
If you believe our services have blocked access to certain websites in error, please follow the instructions on our FortiGuard website to have such blocking reviewed.
In limited cases, we may be able to assist you directly, depending on our contract with our customer and how the blocking happened.
You may contact us with any concern or complaint regarding our privacy practices, and you also may lodge a complaint with the relevant governmental authority.
Some Residents of California and Nevada have specific rights under the next two sections.
b.
Notice of Privacy Rights for California Residents.
Except where expressly noted, the subsections below apply only to “personal information” about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and they supplement the information in the rest of our Privacy Notice above.
Data about individuals who are not residents of California is handled differently and is not subject to the same rights described below.
Californians who wish to exercise the rights described here with respect to Processor Data should contact the customer on whose behalf we handle the data.
The rest of this California section applies only to Controller Data.
Categories of personal information we collect and disclose.
During the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Notice, Fortinet has collected all of the information described in Section 2(a) and Section 3(e) of this Privacy Policy from and about California residents.
During that period, we made the following disclosures of personal information about Californians for business purposes.

CCPA “sale” of California personal information.
Fortinet does not sell personal information as the term “sell” is traditionally understood.
But “sell” under the CCPA is broadly defined.
It includes the sharing of personal information with third parties in exchange for something of value, even if no money changes hands.
For example, sharing an advertising or device identifier with a third party to receive their services may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA in some cases.
During the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Fortinet.
com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering purchasing from us) to marketing and advertising services.
This practice continues today.
Californians have a right to ask us not to “sell” certain personal information as that term is defined in under the CCPA.
You can make such a request by performing BOTH of the following steps.
Complete our Form located in “Contact Us” below and include the phrase “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” in the form fields (or just send us an email at with that request).
AND.
If you’d like your request to include CCPA “sales” that happen through cookies and related technology, follow the steps below that are applicable to your use of our websites.
To opt out of those “sales” that occur through webpages with a URL that begins with “ click on the Cookie Preferences link in the footer.
In the consent preference manager that pops up, click on the Performance Cookies tab and make sure the toggle button is in the off position (the left side of the slider).
Click it if it is not in the off position.
Repeat this process for Advertising Cookies and Functional Cookies and then click the “Confirm My Choices” button.
Be sure to repeat this second step from each browser you use to access our webpages that begin with “  You’ll need to repeat this process again in a particular browser if you clear your cookies in that browser.
Additional control options (which can be used to limit certain data collection or use on Fortinet webpages that don't have a Cookie Preferences link in their footer) are described in the Cookies and Similar Automated Data Collection section of our Privacy Policy below.
We reserve the right to take reasonable steps to verify the validity of your requests.
How we use these categories of personal information.
We and our service providers may use the categories of information we collect from and about you for the purposes described in Section 2 and Section 3(e).
Additional CCPA privacy rights.
If you are a California resident, California law may permit you to request that we.
Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months.
the categories of sources of such information.
the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.
and the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.
Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.
Delete certain information we have about you.
Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law.
For example, the CCPA has significant exemptions for certain B2B data.
You also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).
You also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.
To request to exercise any of these rights and receive the fastest response, please email us at or submit a request through the form located at the bottom of this policy under “Contact Us.
” We reserve the right to require verification of your identify before we fulfill a request, which may include requiring you to login to an existing Fortinet account, providing us with information that matches our records for you, responding to an email we send, or taking other steps relevant to your relationship with us and the nature of your request.
If you are an agent making a request on behalf of a consumer, we reserve the right to take steps to verify that you are authorized to make that request, which may include requiring you to provide us with written proof such as a notarized authentication letter or a power of attorney.
We also may require the consumer to verify their identity directly with us.
Because opt-out requests for sales made through cookies and related technology must be performed from each browser that is used to access our Services, it is easiest for the consumer to perform such opt-outs themselves.
However, if a consumer wishes for an agent to perform browser-based requests on their behalf, the consumer may arrange for the agent to use the consumer’s browser to make such requests.
We are not responsible for the security risks of this or any other arrangements that a consumer may have with an agent.
For clarity, this is not permission for any user to share their login credentials with an agent or any third party.
Such sharing is prohibited and is not required for an agent to make requests under this Privacy Policy.
For security and legal reasons, however, Fortinet reserves the right not to accept requests that require us to access third-party websites or services.
c.
Notice to Nevada Residents.
Under a Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the “sale” of “personally identifiable information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons, as those concepts are defined under the Nevada law, which differs from the CCPA.
“Personally identifiable information” under that law includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online.
We do not engage in such activity.
however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by contacting   We reserve the right to take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.
Once verified, we will maintain your request in the event our practices change.
d.
Aggregate or De-Identified Data.
Subject to applicable law and our contractual obligations, (i) we may aggregate or de-identify Controller Data or Processor Data so that the information cannot be linked to the relevant individual and (ii) our use and disclosure of aggregated, anonymized, and other non-personal information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation for any purpose.
e.
Cookies and Similar Automated Data Collection.
In our websites, apps and emails, we and third parties may collect certain information by automated means such as cookies, Web beacons, tags and scripts or similar technologies, JavaScript and mobile device functionality.
This information may include unique browser identifiers, IP address, browser and operating system information, device identifiers (such as the Apple IDFA or Android Advertising ID), geolocation, other device information, Internet connection information, as well as details about individuals’ interactions with our apps, websites and emails (for example, the URL of the third-party website from which you came, the pages on our website that you visit, and the links you click on in our websites).
We and third parties may use automated means to read or write information on users’ devices, such as in various types of cookies and other browser-based or plugin-based local storage (such as HTML5 storage or Flash-based storage).
Cookies and local storage are files that contain data, such as unique identifiers, that we or a third party may transfer to or read from a user’s device for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, such as recognizing the device, service provision, record-keeping, analytics and marketing, depending on the context of collection.
These technologies help us (a) keep track of whether you are signed in or have previously signed in so that we can display all the features that are available to you.
(b) remember your settings on the pages you visit, so that we can display your preferred content the next time you visit.
(c) display personalize content.
(d) perform analytics, and measure traffic and usage trends, and better understand the demographics of our users.
(e) diagnose and fix technology problems.
and (f) otherwise plan for and enhance our business.
Also, in some cases, we facilitate the collection of information by advertising services administered by third parties.
The ad services may track users’ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means such as cookies, and they may use this information to show users ads that are tailored to their individual interests or characteristics and/or based on prior visits to certain sites or apps, or other information we or they know, infer or have collected from the users.
