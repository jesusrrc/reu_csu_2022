3Forge, LLC and its subsidiaries ("3FORGE" or "3forge.
com" or "we") respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personal information that you may share with us.
This Privacy Policy describes how we may collect and use your personal information.
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, occupation, industry, personal interests, and other information when needed to provide a service or product or carry out a transaction you have requested.
Unless you choose to voluntarily provide the information to us, we do not collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, telephone number, fax number, or e-mail address.
For instance, you may be asked to provide us with your personal information when you apply for a job opening, register to attend a company event, or wish to subscribe to a newsletter.
If you elect to submit any personal information, your submission is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you consent to such terms.
Like many other commercial websites, the 3FORGE website may use standard technologies, such as "cookies" and other HTML tools, to collect information about how you use the site or to record that you opened an email marketing message.
As such, we may log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there.
