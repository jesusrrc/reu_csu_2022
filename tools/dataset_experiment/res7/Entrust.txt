How Long Do We Retain Personal Data.
We only retain personal data for as long as necessary for the purpose in which it was collected.
For example, where your personal data is needed to provide you with access to our websites, online products or services, we retain your personal data for the period in which we are providing that access unless we are required by law to dispose of it earlier or to keep it longer.

Where Do We Keep Your Personal Data and How Do We Protect it.
We use appropriate technical, organizational and administrative security measures to protect your personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
These security measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data.
For example, payment transactions are encrypted using SSL technology or have appropriate safeguards in place to ensure the security and integrity of your personal data where stored on third party servers.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our websites.

It may also be processed by staff who work for us or for one of our suppliers in a location different from where the data was collected.
We will only transfer your personal data as permitted by law.
Certain privacy and data protection laws require data controllers to put in place safeguards to protect personal data transferred across borders.
To comply with this requirement, Entrust has put in place agreements that include the standard contractual clauses recommended by the European Commission to provide adequate safeguards for personal data.

g.
