Data retention.

maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service.
making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings.
complying with our legal obligations.
resolving disputes.
Criteria used to determine the retention periods include.
How can we minimize the data retention period.
Our systems are designed to age out personal data in 90 days, unless another period is selected for legitimate business reasons.
Do we need to keep data to ensure the service that users expect.
We keep personal data for an appropriate period to deliver a personalized service to our users over time.
We typically keep streaming history for the life of an account, for example, to provide retrospective playlists that users enjoy (e.
g.
Your Summer Rewind and the end-of-year Wrapped campaign) and personalized recommendations based on current listening habits.
Are users able to update or delete the data themselves.
Where users are able to see and update the personal data themselves, we keep the information for as long as the user chooses.
For example, we keep your Spotify email address and other profile information until you choose to change or delete it yourself.
Do we need to keep the data to uphold our rules and keep our service safe.
To help ensure user safety, protect against harmful content on our platform, and take action with reports of intellectual property infringement, we may keep data that has been removed from the Spotify Service for a limited period of time.
This helps us investigate potential breaches of our User Guidelines and Platform Rules.
Is Spotify subject to a legal or contractual obligation to keep or delete the data.
Examples include mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation or data kept for the purposes of litigation.
Conversely, we will remove unlawful content if the law requires us to do so.

Transfer to other countries.
Because of the global nature of our business, Spotify shares personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy.
They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live.
For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.
Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to.
make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law.
help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU and the laws which apply where you live.

Keeping your personal data safe.
We're committed to protecting our users' personal data.
We put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.
However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.
We have implemented various safeguards to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.
These include pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies.
To protect your user account, we encourage you to.
use a strong password which you only use for your Spotify account.
never share your password with anyone.
limit access to your computer and browser.
log out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device.
read more detail on protecting your account.
You can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the 'Sign out everywhere' function on your account page.
If other individuals have access to your Spotify account (for example if you've given them permission to use your account on a shared device), then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account.
It's your responsibility to only provide individuals with permission to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them.
Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalised recommendations and be included in your data download.

Children.
Note.
This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids unless the Spotify Kids Privacy Policy says so.
Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.
The Spotify Service has a minimum 'Age Limit' in each country or region.
The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age.
is under the age of 13 years, or.
makes it illegal to process their personal data, or.
requires parental consent to process their personal data.
We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit.
If you're under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.
Instead, we recommend using a Spotify Kids account.
If you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us.
If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.
This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.
When using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, you should be cautious about playing or recommending any content to individuals under 18 years old which could be inappropriate for them.

Changes to this Policy.
