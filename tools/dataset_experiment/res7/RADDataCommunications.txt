RAD is committed to honoring your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is mainly intended to let you know what personal information we may collect about you and how we use that information.
This Privacy Policy applies to personal information we collect through our and through our affiliates’ websites (“Website”).
By logging into our Website and by providing any information, we assume you are interested in obtaining more information about our company, our affiliates, our technology and product offerings.
We urge you to read carefully the terms of this privacy policy before you use the Website.
What type of information we collect.
We collect Personal and Non-Personal information.
Personal information.
The information we collect include your contact details such as first name and surname, username and password, email address, country of residence, job title, and other information you provide us when you create an account on the Website or sign-up to receive communications or materials from us, or otherwise submit a form to us, as well as your domain name, browser and platform type.
Non-personal information.
Non-personal information means information that cannot be traced back to a specific individual, hence to you.
For example, we track the number of visitors at our Website each day.
How we collect information from you.
We collect information from you when you submit it to us.
For example, when you submit a request or downloading information or documents from the Website, or when you electronically provide information to us (including, but not limited to, comments, feedback, employment applications and resumes), you are sometimes asked to provide certain information, including, but not limited to, your name, title, company, address, phone and fax numbers, e-mail address and line of business.
We may also automatically collect analytics, viewing, usage, logs, metrics and other device and technical data when you access our Website or use our services.
For example, when you access our Website, our servers will automatically record certain information about your device and browser, and we may collect usage, clickstream, event data, crash data, and other technical data.
We and our service providers may also use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, scripts and other technologies to collect this information.
You may refer to our "Cookie Policy" for further information.
How we use your information.
We process the personally identifiable information in order to facilitate your requests on the Website, improve the overall quality of your online experience, provide personalized service and communicate separately with you.
When requesting a service or downloading information or documents from our Website, you agree that we use your information (that you provided us), for further delivery of information.
We also process the information in order to improve our Website by counting, tracking, and aggregating your activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at the Website.
We may use your Internet protocol address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Website.
Share your Information.
Your personal information may be shared with certain members of our staff, as well as external consultants.
We may also share your personal information with third party service providers which process your information on our behalf.
however, such service providers will be contractually bound to keep your personal data confidential and appropriately secure.
We may also share your information when we cooperate with other companies, such as our partners or affiliates, to offer joint services to you, or when such partners participate in or otherwise sponsor our events and conferences.
We will be permitted to share your personal information with government authorities and law enforcement, if we are required to do so by law.
We may merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our customers or advertisers.
however, your identity or personal information will not be disclosed without your permission.
We may share your information in connection with a sale or transfer of our company (or any shares in the company) or any similar transaction.
Your personal information (such as customer names and your contact details) may be among the items sold or otherwise acquired in these types of transactions.
We may also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar proceedings involving all or a portion of the company.
You will be notified by email and/or by a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
Other than as stated above, we will always ask your approval before providing your personal information to anyone else.
Transferring your information internationally.
We may store and/or process your personal information in countries outside your place of residence, including in the United States and in Israel.
We currently process the information in Israel (where our database and offices are located).
We rely on the European Commission’s recognition that some non-European Economic Area (EEA) countries have an adequate level of data protection (Israel is one of the countries considered by the EU as having an adequate level of data protection).
In countries, other than EEA countries, which may provide for different data protection rules, we rely on appropriate contractual clauses.
How long we retain your information.
We will retain your information as needed to fulfil our legitimate business purposes in accordance with our internal retention policy and applicable laws and regulations.
If you registered to certain services, we may keep your personal information as long as you don’t unsubscribe to these services.
