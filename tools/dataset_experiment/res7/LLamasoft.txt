Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies.
As mentioned above, we collect information from your visits to our Web site to help us gather statistics about our Web site usage and effectiveness, personalize your experience on our site, and tailor our interactions with you.
We do so through the use of various technologies, including one called “cookies”.
A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as a tag that identifies your computer.
While cookies are often only used to measure Web site usage and effectiveness and to allow for ease of navigation or use and as such, are not associated with any personal information, they are also used at times to personalize a known visitor’s experience to a Web site by being associated with profile information or user preferences.
You can set your browser in most instances to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it or not.
You can also generally set your browser to turn off cookies.
Since cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our Web site’s features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.
If you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able, for instance, to add items to your shopping cart, proceed to checkout, or use any Web site services that require you to sign in.
We may use Web beacons or other technologies to better tailor customer service.
These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across LLamasoft’s Web site.
When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our suppliers.
These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies.
If you don’t want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies.
If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages.
however, they will not be associated with information otherwise stored in cookies.
We may also include Web beacons in marketing e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and links contained within clicked on.
Many web browsers have a “do not track” setting.
That said, there is no widely-accepted standard (through the World Wide Web Consortium or otherwise) governing what should happen when a user selects “do not track” in a browser.
If and when an industry consensus is reached about how to treat a “do not track” setting, LLamasoft will determine whether to follow that consensus approach.
In the meantime, enabling “do not track” in your browser will not change what information is exchanged with your computer, or how that information is used.
You might be able to exercise choices regarding third-party cookies and/or tracking devices.
You can obtain more information about those choices at  or .
Links to Non-LLamasoft Web Sites and Third-Party Applications.
To allow you to interact with other Web sites on which you may have accounts (such as Facebook and other social media sites) or join communities on such sites, we may provide links or embed third-party applications that allow you to login, post content or join communities from our Web sites.
We may also provide you with general links to non-LLamasoft Web sites.
Your use of these links and applications is subject to the third parties’ privacy policies, and you should become familiar with the third-party sites’ privacy policies before using the links or applications.
LLamasoft is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other Web sites.
