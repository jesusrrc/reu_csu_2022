3.
If I already have a standard or academic license, can I set up another MathWorks Account for home use.
Yes.
You can set up an additional MathWorks account.
Make sure to use a different email address as each MathWorks Account is associated with a unique email address.

4.
What is a message.
ThingSpeak stores messages in channels.
A message is defined as a write of up to 8 fields of data to a ThingSpeak channel.
For example, a channel representing a weather station could include the following 8 fields of data.
temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, battery level, and light level.
Each message cannot exceed 3000 bytes.
Examples of messages include.
A write to a ThingSpeak channel using the REST API or target-specific ThingSpeak librariesFrom an embedded deviceFrom another computer A write to a ThingSpeak channel using MQTTA write to a ThingSpeak channel from MATLAB using thingspeakwrite or the REST APIA write to a ThingSpeak channel inside ThingSpeak using the MATLAB Analysis or MATLAB Visualizations Apps Any writes to ThingSpeak triggered by a React or a Timecontrol.

6.
What are units.
ThingSpeak is sold in units.
One unit = 33 million messages for use during the term of the annual license.
As a reference, one unit provides the ability for a device sending data to ThingSpeak at once per second to send data to ThingSpeak for one year.
One unit also provides the ability to create a fixed number of channels on ThingSpeak (e.
g.
, one standard license type unit provide 250 channels).
The number of channels that can be created depends on the license type.
See How to Buy Pages for details.

7.
When I purchase a unit of messages, how long do they last before expiration.
They last approximately one year from the purchase date.
More precisely, they last from 365-395 days depending on purchase date.
Licenses always end at the end of the month so a purchase made on November 20, 2016 will terminate on November 30, 2017.

8.
Can I have both free and paid license at the same time.
No.
If your login is associated with a free license and you purchase (or become a Licensed End User on a paid license) a paid license, your free license and associated messages are no longer available.
No.
If your login is associated with a free license and you purchase (or become a Licensed End User on a paid license) a paid license, your free license and associated messages are no longer available.
9.
What are the benefits of purchasing one of the paid license over using a free license.
The paid license options offer the ability to send and process more data on ThingSpeak.
The paid license options also offer the ability to have more channels on ThingSpeak, which allows you to connect more devices to ThingSpeak.
They offer reduced message update interval limit of one second, allowing you to send data to ThingSpeak more frequently (the free option limit is 15 seconds).
The academic and standard paid options also offer technical support, and a longer timeout for MATLAB calculations.
In addition, the Standard license option offers the ability build commercial projects with ThingSpeak.

11.
If I have purchased additional units during the year, which units will get used.

12.
What happens if I run out of messages or channels on my license.
Your ThingSpeak channels will no longer accept new data points.
However, you can avoid this situation by adding additional unit(s) to your license prior to using up all your messages.
If you run out of channels, you will not be able to create additional channels.

What happens to any unused messages I have when my unit expires.
When a unit expires, all unused messages are no longer available.

14.
How does MathWorks estimate “suggested daily usage rate”.
Recommended maximum daily usage rate is based on the capacity available on your license.
For example, a license with one unit = 33 million messages has a recommended maximum daily usage rate of REPLACE_PAID_MESSAGES_PER_DAY messages per day.
A license with two units = 66 million would have a recommended maximum daily usage rate of REPLACE_PAID_MESSAGES_PER_DAY_TWO_UNITS messages per day.
You may exceed your recommended maximum daily usage, but doing so may result in exhausting your messages before your license expires.

You may exceed your recommended maximum daily usage, but doing so may result in exhausting your messages before your license expires.
15.
Can I have more than one ThingSpeak™ license at the same time.
Normally, no.
However, it is possible that you may have valid access to multiple licenses.
In that case, you choose which license you would like to have messages drawn down from when you setup your ThingSpeak channels.

16.
Where do I see the consumption rate for the messages.
On your My Account page, you can see how many messages you have remaining and your consumption rate.

17.
How will I know if I am running low on messages.
ThingSpeak will attempt to notify you if it appears you will run out of messages based on your recent historical usage.
If you are notified, you may need to purchase additional units to ensure your ThingSpeak channels will continue to receive data.

19.
Does using any of the apps in ThingSpeak™ affect my messages in any way.
Your messages are consumed when you write data to a ThingSpeak channel.
If you write data to a channel from one of the ThingSpeak Apps, you will consume messages.
For example, if are using the MATLAB Analysis app to compute a value that is derived from data you have stored in ThingSpeak channels, you will not consume messages, but if you save/write that value to another channel, you will consume messages.

20.
How is Compute Timeout defined.
When you request a MATLAB calculation in ThingSpeak, the execution time must be less than the compute timeout.
The execution time includes the request communication time, response communication time and the calculation time.

21.
How is message update interval limit defined.
Message update interval limit is the minimum interval for which ThingSpeak will accept new data from your devices.
This limit is a per channel limit.
This means each channel that you have setup in ThingSpeak can receive data up to the defined limit.

30.
Why is the pricing different when I have multiple units on my renewal.
If you made multiple purchases at different times during the year, renewal for these units will be synchronized, or co-termed, so they share a single Service End Date based on the earliest Service End Date of the individual purchases.
Your renewal pricing and the number of messages deposited into your account at renewal will be prorated.
If your ThingSpeak license is on a Master License with other products like MATLAB, the renewal date will be synchronized with the Master License renewal date.
At renewal time, your ThingSpeak renewal pricing and the number of messages deposited into your account at renewal will be prorated.
