Privacy Policy.
Respecting the privacy of our listeners and users is a core part of our mission.

Plain Language Policy.
When you visit this site, we place a cookie on your browser.
We only collect aggregate data about the number of people who visit the site and which pages they visit.
If you wish to become completely anonymous to us, clear your cookies.
That’s it.
If you send us an email or a letter (with a story idea, for example) we will have your email address and any other information you share with us.
If you don’t wish to share information with us, don’t send it.
If you are a child under the age of 18, please check with your parents/guardians before getting in touch.
As a small, independent media company, we need to work with a variety of third party platforms and services.
SXM Media sells advertising on our shows, and helps distribute our podcasts.
Companies that track podcast analytics such as Apple, Google Play, Podtrac, Triton and Chartable collect information on how many people download our episodes and other information.
NPR and some 400 public radio stations distribute our content over the radio and various websites and social media.
Google Ad Sense places ads on our site.
Substack provides a platform for our newsletter.
We use Facebook, Twitter and other social media to promote our stories.
Our fans can become our supporters on Patreon.
If you listen to an episode of Hidden Brain on this site, our podcast distribution partner collects data about that to generate analytics about our listenership.
If you click on an ad, Google Ad Sense knows about that.
If you share your credit card with Patreon, they will store it.
Social media sites, Substack and public radio stations all collect a variety of information about your browsing and listening habits.
To be perfectly honest, as content creators, we don’t know all the information about you that our third party providers are collecting, and you should reach out to them if you’d like to learn more.
