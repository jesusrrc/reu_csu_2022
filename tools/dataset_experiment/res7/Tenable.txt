Cookies.
What are cookies.
We may collect information using “cookies.
” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website.
We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which            stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.
We use two broad categories of cookies.
(1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site.

These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features.

These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you.

You can disable cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting  or                                 If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see advertisements, but they may not be relevant to you.
Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online                                behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.
Disabling cookies.

After the expiration of the applicable retention periods, we will delete your Personal Data.

(i) what Personal Data is concerned.
and (ii) which of the above rights you would like to exercise.
For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Data associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing            your request.
We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event, within one month of your request.
Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, legal purposes and/or to            complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion.
Your Rights Relating to Customer Data.
As described above, we may also process Personal Data submitted by or for a customer of our products and services.
To this end, if not addressed in this Policy or in a separate disclosure, we process such Personal Data in our role as processor on behalf            of a customer (and/or its affiliates) who is the responsible controller of the Personal Data concerned.
We are not responsible for and have no control over the privacy and data security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth            in this Policy.
If your data has been submitted to us by or on behalf of a Tenable customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have under applicable data protection laws, please inquire with the applicable customer directly.
If you wish to make            your request directly to us, please provide to us the name of the Tenable customer who submitted your data to us.
We will refer your request to that customer, and will support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
Your Preferences for Email Communications.
If you prefer not to receive promotional materials, our email newsletter or other forms of communication, you may choose to opt-out or manage your email subscriptions by using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email you have received from Tenable            or by using the following link.
Tenable will honor your requests to opt-out of specified emails and marketing materials.
Please note that opting out of marketing communications            does not opt you out of receiving important business communications related to your current relationship with us, such as communications about your subscriptions or event registrations, service announcements, or security information.

Your California Privacy Rights.
The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) gives California residents certain rights as described below.
For this section, we use the terms “personal information” and “sale” as those are defined in the CCPA.
Request to know – You have the right to request a copy of the categories or specific pieces of personal information that Tenable collects, uses, shares or sells about you.
Request to delete - You have the right to request that Tenable delete the personal information we have collected from you.
You have the right to request to opt out from the sale of your personal information.
Because Tenable does not sell your personal information, you do not need to exercise this right.
Your right to know and right to delete are subject to certain exceptions under the CCPA, for example as necessary to perform or evidence a transaction or contract, comply with a legal obligation, or when a consumer’s identity cannot be reasonably verified.
Exercising your CCPA Rights.
To make a CCPA request, you can.
Call us toll-free at 833-720-0398.
Email us at [email protected] using “CCPA Request” in the subject line.
Your request must (1) provide sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected personal information, and (2) describe your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria.
We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity and complete your request.
You may also authorize an agent (“Authorized Agent”) to exercise your CCPA rights on your behalf.
To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.
Non-Discrimination.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights and we will not deny you goods or services, charge you a different price, or provide you with a lesser quality of goods or services if you exercise any of your CCPA rights.
Other California Resident Rights.
Under California law, a California resident who has provided Tenable with personal information is entitled to request certain information with respect to the types of personal information that Tenable has shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
In accordance with California law, Tenable will, in response to your written request, provide you with the means to choose not to have your information shared.
Except as otherwise stated in this Policy (including, but not limited to, sharing information with our third party resellers), we will not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure.
To prevent further disclosure to your personal information from use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personal information on our Site.
If you opt-in to receive communication from a third party, your personal information will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy.
If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your personal information, you must contact that third party directly, as Tenable has no control over a third party’s use of personal information.
You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.
California residents may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing [email protected].
Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per individual per year and are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
16.
