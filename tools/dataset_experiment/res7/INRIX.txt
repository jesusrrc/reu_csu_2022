For any complaints related to the Privacy Shield that cannot be resolved with us directly, you may refer the matter to the American Arbitration Association, an independent dispute resolution body, at  Finally, under limited circumstances and after other available dispute resolution mechanisms have been exhausted, binding arbitration is available to address certain residual complaints under the Privacy Shield not resolved by other means.
We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations.

We may also share your personal data in the following ways.

(i) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations.

Aggregated/de-identified disclosures.
We may make certain aggregated or otherwise non-personal data available to third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with various reporting obligations.
(ii) for business or marketing purposes.
or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through the website and our products.
Security of your personal dataAlthough no security measures are 100% foolproof, INRIX implements reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal data against unauthorized or unlawful access, disclosure, alteration, loss, or destruction by employing a broad variety of security mechanisms.
Our strategy relies on the intelligent application of techniques and technologies that exist today and strikes a balance between protection capabilities, efficiency and cost, performance and operational considerations.
For example, we use security measures such as hashing of IDs, encryption, and multi-factor identification.
For information stored on premises controls are implemented in an effort to restrict access.
