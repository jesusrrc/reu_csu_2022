This Privacy Policy was last updated on January 28, 2021.
Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of Signal Sciences, LLC (“Signal Sciences”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”).
This Site is operated by Signal Sciences and has been created to provide information about our company and our web application defense services (together with the Site, the “Services”) to our Services visitors (“you”, “your”).
This Privacy Policy sets forth Signal Sciences’ policy with respect to personal data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from visitors to the Services.
We are committed to protecting your privacy, being transparent about the Personal Data and other information being collected, and exceeding information security standards for protecting that data.
With our Services, we have worked to build features that give customers more control over their data, like IP anonymization and data redactions.
We also are certified to the EU-U.

Signal Sciences uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided.

Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.
Signal Sciences may also use your Personal Data and other information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, and to better understand our users and to improve the Services.

Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you.
We may store such information on our systems or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by our agents or service providers.
The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers, so that we can better understand usage as well as make improvements.

BUSINESS TRANSFERS.
As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.
In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event (collectively a “Transaction”), Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.

When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.

Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to us via the Internet.

We will keep your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, while we have a legitimate business need to do so, or as required by law (e.
g.
for tax, legal, accounting or other purposes), whichever is the longer.
If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences until you opt out of receiving these communications and request that we delete information about you in accordance with our policies.
To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case it is no longer Personal Data.
Changes to the privacy policy.
The Site, Services and our business may change from time to time.
As a result, at times it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy.
Signal Sciences reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice.

Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Data.
