(together referred to in this Privacy Policy as “we” and “our”) with regard to the personal information of individuals, customers and licensees who visit and use our online, web-based platform and mobile applications known as Atom App (the “Services”).
This Privacy Policy will help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you share with us.
By using or accessing the Atom website and applications, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
In this privacy policy, we sometimes refer to “You”.

This Atom Privacy Policy applies to the collection, hosting, storage, security, processing, transfer, and use of, as well as the access to, personal information, customer data, and services data concerning You, and applies only to use of the Services and not to any other services or products provided by SADA, Collins, or any third parties.
How We Collect and Use Information.
We collect and use Your personal information to provide our Services to You and to operate and improve the Atom website and services.
We will only use your personal information in ways outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Depending on how You use the Atom website, applications, and Services, we may collect the following types of information and use it in this manner.
Accessing our website – Like most websites, our Atom website automatically collects and uses the data contained in log files.
Information in log files may include Your computer’s IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the web browser You used to visit our site, the time You visited our site, which web pages You visited, and other anonymous site usage data.
Every computer with internet capability is given a number that serves as that computer’s IP address.
When You request a page from Atom’s website, our web servers automatically recognize Your IP address.
The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about You other than the IP address from which You have accessed our site.
We may use this information to examine traffic in aggregate, investigate misuse of SADA’s websites, detect fraud, or cooperate with law enforcement.
Information You provide – We offer access to some information and services without a charge, but to access the information we ask that You complete a registration form.
In this instance, we may ask You to provide limited personal information (such as your name and email address).
Furthermore, employees of our customers may provide information through Atom’s website and applications in order to use the Services.
Such information will include first and last name, work email address (which may include an image of the employee profile from Google Accounts if the employee signs-in using his or her Google-based email for work), and phone number.
In the future, the Atom website and related applications may collect an employee’s geolocation using such employee’s mobile device in order to provide traffic conditions and routes, weather alerts, disaster alerts, and on-site updates when actual work is being conducted.
Our geolocation will allow the user to opt-in and opt-out of any alerts or other notifications by modifying applicable settings.
How we and others may communicate with You using the information You provide – We communicate through email, and notices posted on the Atom website.
Examples of these email notices include.
(1) welcome and engagement messages – when You register for our Services, we may send you a series of emails to inform You about how to best use our Services, as well as to inform you of new features.
(2) service messages – these will cover service availability, security, and other issues about the functioning of Atom.
and (3) promotional email messages, which may contain promotional information directly about us or about our business partners.
Finally, we may provide Your contact information to our partners for marketing purposes.

You may change your email and contact preferences, or any other personal information, at any time by notifying us as explained in more detail at the end of this policy under the “Your Privacy Rights” section of this Policy.
