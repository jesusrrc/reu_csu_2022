2 Legal basis of the processing.
Art.
6 (1) lit.
a DSGVO serves our company as the legal basis for processing operations in which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.
If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations that are necessary for the provision of another service or consideration, the processing is based on Art.
6 (1) lit.
b DSGVO.
The same applies to processing operations that are necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of enquiries about our products or services.
If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which the processing of personal data becomes necessary, such as for the fulfilment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art.
6 (1) lit.
c DSGVO.
In rare cases, the processing of personal data might become necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.
In that case, the processing would be based on Art.
6(1)(d) DSGVO.
Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art.
6 (1) lit.
f DSGVO.
Processing operations which are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary for the protection of a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overridden.
Such processing operations are permitted to us in particular because they were specifically mentioned by the European legislator.
In this respect, it took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if you are a customer of our company (recital 47, sentence 2 of the GDPR).

Google Analytics.
If you have given us your consent, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, hereinafter "Google"), on our website.

Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how users use the site.
This includes the following cookies in detail.
The information generated by the cookies, such as the time, place and frequency of your website visit, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google and stored there.

_anonymizeIp", your IP address will be truncated by Google within Member States of the European Union or in other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.

Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.
You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.
Furthermore, Google offers a deactivation add-on for the most common browsers, which gives you more control over what data is collected by Google about the websites you visit.
The add-on tells the JavaScript (ga.
js) of Google Analytics that no information about the website visit should be transmitted to Google Analytics.
However, the Google Analytics browser deactivation add-on does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analytics services we may use.
For more information on how to install the browser add-on, please click on the following link.
