The following terms apply only to the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union.
Adtran recognizes that the European Union (“EU”) has adopted the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which requires “adequate protection” for the transfer of personally identifiable information about individuals in the EU to Adtran operations in the US.
Transfers (if any) of Personal Data from the EU to a third county are made (A) to a country providing adequate data protection (as deemed by the European Commission from time to time).
(B) pursuant to the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission (“Standard Contractual Clauses”) or by a Supervisory Authority and approved by the European Commission.
or (C) authorized by all applicable Supervisory Authorities in Europe, as the case may be, such as through Binding Corporate Rules approved by all applicable Supervisory Authorities (collectively “Permitted Transfers”)”.

and for other legitimate purposes permitted by applicable law or otherwise with your consent.
Where required by GDPR and other applicable law, we enter into written agreements with those third-party agents and service providers requiring them to provide the same level of protection GDPR and other applicable law requires and limiting their use of the data to the specified services provided on our behalf.
We take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that third-party agents and service providers process personal information in accordance with GDPR and other applicable law and to stop and remediate any unauthorized processing.
Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of our third-party agents or service providers who perform services on our behalf for their handling of personal information that we transfer to them.
Third-Party Data Controllers.
In some cases we may transfer Personal Data to unaffiliated third-party data controllers (if outside the EU, only if a “Permitted Transfer”).
These third parties do not act as agents or service providers and are not performing functions on our behalf.
We will only provide your Personal Data to third-party data controllers where you have not opted-out of such disclosures, or in the case of sensitive Personal Data, where you have opted-in if GDPR or other applicable law requires consent.
