Our Customers.
"The AssetPulse active RFID solution meets my needs for managing the ALS vacuum equipment pool.
The inventory and search capability of the active system is invaluable during the yearly wall to wall inventory of the entire lab.
Having an up-to-date inventory record of all assets will cut the time and labor cost to the lab to an ultimate minimum.
Previously, wall-to-wall inventory has taken multiple weeks to manually find and scan these assets.
".
"The AssetPulse solution has not only helped us gain visibility into our fast growing inventory, but it has also helped us increase efficiency and quality by allowing us to track maintenance and inspections of all our equipment in a proactive manner.
".
"We wanted to track what goes in and out of the stations, and at what times.
" Alco worked with AssetPulse, an RFID systems integrator specializing in asset-tracking applications.
He says "The system has been in place for 18 months, Chaabane says, having been rolled out permanently after being tested on a small scale for a few months.
To date, he adds, Alco has spent approximately $100,000 for the entire system, though he estimates that the company has already seen a return on its investment through improved asset utilization, as well as by avoiding having to replace lost assets.
