Data Processed to Provide Neustar Products and Services.
Neustar provides a variety of marketing, risk, communications, security, and registry solutions to help businesses and others make better decisions, better serve their customers, enable communications, and detect and respond to fraud, cybersecurity threats, and other malicious behavior.
Customers may combine some or all features of our products and services described below.
Marketing Solutions.
We provide a variety of services to online and offline advertisers and their agents through our marketing services offerings, including our Ad Advisor, Customer Analytics, Customer Experience and Customer Intelligence services.
AdAdvisor.
Neustar Audiences, including AdAdvisor and our ElementOne segmentation solutions, enable advertisers to understand their CRM Data and to apply those insights to reach and communicate with their existing customers and large groups of similar households and individuals in the on and offline environments.
To do this, we collect consumer survey data, reliably-sourced household/neighborhood-level demographic data, and other licensed lifestyle and purchasing data from third party providers, which we aggregate across US households and use to make predictions about the preferences and interests of large groups of similar consumers based on pre-defined market segments, identified by a numeric Segment Code (also called an “Element”).
In addition, we enable our advertisers to reach and communicate with specific users who may be interested in their products and services based on pseudonymized Attribute Data derived from reputable sources.
We use this information to help advertisers deliver more relevant online content.
We may share Pseudonymous IDs with our affiliates and service providers to support advertising customers.
In order to enable our customers to use their information across the Internet advertising ecosystem, we "sync" Cookies with various ad platforms and tech providers.
You can learn more about this process by reviewing our explanation of Cookie Sync Partners.
Fabrick.
In order to serve third party advertisement on their sites, online publishers may share certain pseudonymized information, including a hashed version of information that they collect from website visitors (such as email or phone number), third party IDs (such as mobile advertising IDs or other IDs assigned by third parties), IP addresses, and/or information about your browser or operating system with Neustar.
Neustar may match this pseudonymized information with information in our data repositories and issue another pseudonymous ID, which is changed on a weekly basis, for the publisher’s use in connection with real-time bidding for digital advertising.
Neustar and other third parties may also link demographic or interest based information to your browser via Cookies as part of this process.
Customer Analytics.
Neustar's MarketShare services compile and analyze aggregated sales data, aggregated online Event Data (which may include addressable and connected TV data), information about offline marketing activities, along with other economic modeling data and aggregate ad response data from a variety of platforms (on and offline) in order to measure ad campaign effectiveness and attribute conversion events to marketing campaigns.
This enables advertisers to understand their customer's path to conversion and facilitate smarter marketing spend decisions.
For customers using our Onboarding services, we may also collect Hashed eMail Addresses, Hashed MAIDs, and/or imprecise (city/metro area/provincial/state/zip level) Geolocation Data from data partners.
Customer Experience.
Neustar's Customer Experience services connect data and media across channels (online, offline, television, etc.
) to enable marketers to analyze the effectiveness of their advertising activities and determine where to invest in order to generate sales more efficiently.
IDMP.
Neustar's Identity Data Management Platform (IDMP) collects, and aggregates Log Data, including Internet Log Data, Event Data, and other information that is generated when you visit the websites of our publisher, retailer, and advertiser customers or when their ads are delivered to you on a third-party website.
We use Psuedonymous IDs such as DIIs, Cookies, Mobile Advertising IDs or MAIDs, Pixel Tags, Web Beacons, Statistical IDs, third-party identifiers and other Pseudonymous IDs that do not, by themselves, identify a specific individual.
In addition, the IDMP offering enables customers to use their own or third-party Attribute Data to improve the accuracy and performance of our IDMP.
We aggregate and normalize this information, along with website and pseudonymized CRM Data and, in some cases, pseudonymized Attribute Data in order to provide insights about the demographics and interests of an advertiser's customers and prospects, the advertisements they see, and how they interact with online content.
Customers may also receive pseudonymized Cookie-level data using Neustar's Data Science Development Kit (DSDK) to perform their own analysis and aggregation.
Customers use our aggregation reports and/or DSDK to improve the performance of their advertising campaigns, to better understand their audiences, and to enhance the relevance of advertisements.
Neustar collects Event Data to help our customers analyze and understand how effective their advertising is.
Our customers may use our services to understand how you interact with them across their own and partner/third party web properties, and to communicate with you more effectively based on that information.
In some cases, these advertisers use Neustar tools to build consumer profiles (e.
g.
, "gardener" or "sports enthusiast") or predict consumer preferences based on a specific person's online behavior over time and across related and unrelated websites.
Our customers use this information to communicate with consumers who are likely to be interested in their products and services.
Data Onboarding.
Using a process called Cross Device Linking, we create and store linkages between and among household or individual level Pseudonymous IDs such as DIIs, Cookies, Mobile Advertising IDs or MAIDs, Pixel Tags, Web Beacons, Statistical IDs, and other third-party identifiers, including connected and addressable TV Identifiers, that do not, by themselves, identify a specific individual.
We use these linkages to "onboard" or associate customer-provided segmentation information with third party DII.
We use this information on behalf of our customers to measure and analyze the effectiveness of particular advertising campaigns and understand at an aggregate level the impact these campaigns have on offline and online behavior.
Our customers or their agents may also use this information to target advertising based on consumer preferences and characteristics, including pseudonymized Attribute Data.
Remarketing.
We also use Pseudonymous IDs along with Event Data, Attribute Data, the stored cross-device linkages discussed above, and in some cases, customer CRM Data to help our customers re-market to their web site visitors.
For example, we may generate a list of households associated with visitors to an advertiser's website and provide that list to a neutral third party for follow up postal mail or email.
Unless a user has expressly consented, we segregate DII from PII, such as address, and take other steps to ensure that this information is not merged.
Website Personalization (PageAdvisor).
Neustar collects Pseudonymous IDs and passes on the associated Segment Codes and Attribute Data so that our customers can customize content, advertisements, or offers displayed to their website visitors in real time.
Customer Intelligence.
Neustar's Customer Intelligence service uses Personal Information collected from a wide variety of public and private sources.
Our business customers use this information to identify or verify the identity of existing customers and prospective customers who contact them (for example through their customer service center, online forms, or lead generation channels) to provide better customer service, communicate more effectively, use their marketing resources more efficiently, and comply with various laws and regulations.
Customers also use these services to correct, update, and enhance their CRM Data and, in combination with our predictive market segmentation tools described below, to offer products and services you may be interested in.
Risk Solutions.
Compliance Intelligence.
Neustar's Contact and TCPA Compliance services helps customers mitigate regulatory risk and improve operational efficiencies by verifying the linkages between a consumer's name, phone number, valid consent, and other offline attributes.
This helps our customers comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by confirming that the number they are calling belongs to the consumer who provided consent to be contacted at that number.
Our CCPA Compliance solution allows customers to easily verify the identity of individuals seeking to exercise their rights under applicable data protection law and facilitates responses to access, deletion, and opt-out requests.
Fraud Intelligence.
Neustar uses data from a variety of sources, including offline data, customer provided data including PII, third-party licensed data, and Cross Device Linking data, or other Pseudonymous IDs (e.
g.
, IP Addresses, and Cookies, Mobile Advertising IDs or MAIDs, and Statistical Identifiers to help our customers verify their registered customers, prevent, detect, investigate and respond to fraud and other malicious behavior, and to achieve operational efficiency.
Neustar helps our customers achieve inbound and outbound operational efficiency and prevent fraud by matching, enhancing, correcting, or corroborating their CRM Data.
Neustar provides phone attribute information (e.
g.
, whether the phone has been ported, disconnected, or changed recently) to help our customers defend against potential fraud, account takeover, and spoofing.
Information from Cross-Device Linking can also be used in connection with our IP Information and IP Reputation services to flag potentially fraudulent account opening activities.
Neustar’s TRUSTID Authenticator and Indicator Software as a Service services provide an ownership-based authentication token that allows call centers to identify trusted callers before their calls are answered.
Call center customers transmit data associated with inbound calls to Neustar, which Neustar uses on behalf of the customer to determine, among other things, whether or not a calling party number has a high probability of being intentionally falsified.
This enables businesses to identify and protect again potential identity theft.
Operational Intelligence.
Neustar uses a combination of internal and external sources to provide our Right Party Contact/Call Window service.
The service is built using offline date and time information about access to proprietary Neustar data repositories that support a variety of our products, overlaid with offline insights about phone type and activation date.
All of these inputs are aggregated across time and analyzed using complex rules to predict day/time windows when you are most likely to be available to answer your phone.
Our customers use these insights to comply with a variety of consumer protection rules regarding outbound calling, identify and mitigate fraud, and enhance the efficiency of their outbound calling programs.
IP Geopoint Intelligence.
Neustar collects IP Addresses and other geolocation-related information using proprietary, patented technologies to map routable IP Addresses worldwide.
By augmenting our data with insights derived from select global partners, we provide city-level data down to postal codes.
We may use Geolocation Data from reputable sources to enhance our Risk Solutions services.
Our IP Intelligence services also use IP Address and other Geolocation Data information to help our customers detect potentially fraudulent transactions (i.
e.
, by flagging suspicious IP Addresses or log-ins from unlikely locations), and comply with geographic sales and content delivery regulations.
IP Reputation.
Neustar collects IP Addresses and analyzes trends and patterns associated with them.
By augmenting our data with insights derived from select global partners, we provide risk scores that allow our customers to determine whether an IP Address is a real human user (vs.
a bot) or whether malicious activities have been associated with the IP Address in the past.
Our customers may use this information to detect, prevent, and respond to fraud and other risks.
Communications Solutions.
Neustar provides a variety of services to communications services providers to ensure that calls are properly routed across telecommunications service provider networks.
These services include Caller ID/Caller Name (CNAM) services and optimization, branded contact management, robocall detection and mitigation services, domestic and international number resolutions services, directory listings management, business listings, numbering and order management services, and other services provided to communications services providers and other businesses.

Neustar's Pathfinder response consists of the carrier of record for the queried phone number and any number port history information.
Order Management.
We provide services to help communications companies manage their domestic US phone numbering inventory, manage and fulfill customer number porting orders, and to comply with regulatory requirements.

This will allow you to click on an opt-out link to automatically opt out of the use of Cookies.
In addition, Neustar’s Privacy Choices Portal also permits you to opt-out of the use of Hashed eMail Addresses and Android Mobile Advertising IDs as well as to learn about and exercise any rights you may have under applicable law.

You can learn more about online advertising and privacy at the DAA's website.
We comply with opt-out requests by placing an "opt-out cookie" on your computer or device.
Consequently, if you clear your Cookies on that computer or device, we will not be able to read our "opt-out cookie" and may resume collecting information from that computer or device for purposes of retargeting.
Similarly, an opt-out request will not be effective on other browsers, computers, or devices you may use if you have not opted out while using that browser, computer, or device.
Please note Cookies are browser and device specific, so you must opt out on all of the browsers (e.
g.
Chrome, Safari) and devices (e.
g.
laptop, smartphones) you use.
Mobile Advertising IDs or MAIDs.
You can opt-out of our use of Mobile Advertising IDs or MAIDs set by Android devices via the Neustar Choice Portal link in the Privacy Choices page on our website.
Because Apple does not disclose their IDFA to users, we are not able to establish a block based on an Apple MAID (IDFA) in our system.
In addition.
Apple's iOS IDFA can be reset by the user at any time.
Users can opt out of all remarketing by enabling a device setting called "Limit Ad Tracking" (LAT), which restricts advertisers from using the IDFA for behavioral advertising.
You can learn how to limit ad tracking on your iOS device or to reset your IDFA here.
IDFA Opt-Out.
Similar to IDFA for Apple devices, Android devices pass the Google Advertising ID, which provides the same type of device-specific, unique, resettable ID for advertising as Apple IDFA or IFA.
You can learn more about how identifiers on mobile devices are used for advertising and receive instruction for how to opt out of mobile advertising on the Google Privacy & Terms webpage.
Please note MAIDs are device specific, so you must opt out each mobile device (e.
g.
smart phone, tablet) that you use.

You can opt-out of our use of your Hashed Email Addresses in connection with Neustar services by clicking on the Neustar Choice Portal link in the Privacy Choices page on our website.
We will retain your email address on an internal "block" list to prevent its further use in connection with Neustar services.

Please visit our Privacy Choices page to better understand your privacy choices.
Please note that opting out of Neustar's processing of your data does not mean you will block online advertising altogether or see fewer ads.
It simply means that the ads that you see will not be personalized for you.
Ads may be served because they relate to the website you are visiting or to your current search, or they may just be randomly placed.
Your choice to use any of our opt-out tools will not affect ads placed by any other organization.
