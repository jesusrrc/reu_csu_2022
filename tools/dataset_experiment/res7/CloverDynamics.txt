Clover Privacy Policy Template.
Clover requires app developers to adopt and maintain a privacy policy that applies to your Clover app that discloses to merchants your app’s data collection, use, and sharing.
The privacy policy is intended to enable merchants to make appropriate disclosures to their customers in the merchant’s own privacy policy.
For your convenience, Clover provides a sample privacy policy as a reference to help you and/or your legal counsel prepare a privacy policy.
Ultimately, it is your decision what your privacy policy says.
Clover cannot provide legal advice.
This sample privacy policy assumes that your business does not already have a privacy policy.
if you already have a privacy policy and you choose to adopt this privacy policy in addition, you and/or your legal counsel should ensure there are no inconsistencies between this policy and any other policy that you maintain.
This sample privacy policy assumes that you are (a) collecting, using, and disclosing personal data only for the sole and exclusive benefit of the merchant that has installed the app.
and (b) not determining the purposes or means of processing personal data, or otherwise using personal data for your own purposes.
If either assumption is not true (such as in the case of an app where the consumer independently registers with your service outside of the Clover POS), this sample privacy policy is not appropriate for use.
The green-highlighted language below is intended to provide information to help you and/or your legal counsel identify appropriate disclosures for your unique business.
The yellow-highlighted language below is intended to identify information that you should fill in.
If you use this sample privacy policy as the template for your own privacy policy, before finalizing the document, please be sure that.
The policy fully and accurately describes your privacy practices and does not omit any material information.

You erase all highlighted language in the document and this introduction.
