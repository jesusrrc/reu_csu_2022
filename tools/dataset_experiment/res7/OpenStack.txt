Policies.
Policies¶.
Each OpenStack service defines the access policies for its resources in anassociated policy file.
A resource, for example, could be API access, theability to attach to a volume, or to fire up instances.
The policy rules arespecified in JSON format and the file is called policy.
json.
Thesyntax and format of this file is discussed in the Configuration Reference.
These policies can be modified or updated by the cloud administrator tocontrol the access to the various resources.
Ensure that any changes to theaccess control policies do not unintentionally weaken the security of anyresource.
Also note that changes to the policy.
json file become effectiveimmediately and do not require the service to be restarted.
The following example shows how the service can restrict access to create,update and delete resources to only those users which have the role ofcloud_admin, which has been defined as being the conjunction ofrole = admin and domain_id = admin_domain_id, while the get and listresources are made available to users which have the role of cloud_adminor admin.
