In the case of a personal data breach, we will without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of user.
A typical plan would be.
– Identify what data may have been affected (modified/deleted/copied)– Determine a plan of actions to either undo the data alteration (ex.
restore backup) and/or prevent the further breach.
(ex.
change password)– Communicate with customers whose data are affected by the incident, with the potential call to action (eg.
Change password).
– Log the incident (when and what) and actions are taken to fix it.
– Set a follow-up date to determine if the incident is solved or needs further actions.
On top of that, our cloud infrastructure protects the data 24/7.
We will not give anyone direct access to the data including governments and we promise to keep improving the security and encryption for our service.
All UnaBiz employees must complete data privacy and security training.
