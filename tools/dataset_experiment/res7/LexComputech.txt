This policy statement outlines how  LEX COMPUTECH  ( LEX SYSTEM )  collects, uses, and shares personal information about anyone – including customers, clients, business partners, suppliers, and representatives of organizations – with whom  LEX COMPUTECH  ( LEX SYSTEM )  has, or is considering entering into, a business relationship.
The collection of your personal information.
Personal information is almost always collected through direct communication such as a company survey.
We also regularly gather information about individuals when they register for or take part in a company event.
The personal information of people living within the EU will be collected in accordance with EU Privacy Legislation, and this may affect your rights – see the Your rights section below.
We might collect your personal information for a number of different reasons, which include.
Website and online service ease of use.
When you visit  LEX COMPUTECH  ( LEX SYSTEM )  website or use an associated online service, information such as your user name, password, IP address, and personal browser settings will be gathered to ensure you have access to relevant information and services, and also to allow us to operate our websites and comply with relevant legal requirements.
Additionally, to personalize your website experience, information about the way in which you use  LEX COMPUTECH  ( LEX SYSTEM )  websites, such as your preferences and settings, will be recorded.
This data will help us improve our products and services.
Our ability to contact existing and prospective clients, partners, and suppliers, and their staff.
In order to deliver products and services, provide support, manage contracts, and invoice customers, we collect business contact information for existing and prospective clients, partners, and suppliers.

Efficient handling of orders and response to requests for information or support.
Whenever you contact LEX COMPUTECH (LEX SYSTEM), whether online or otherwise, to order products or services or to ask for information or support, we will record the information we need to fulfill your order or answer your enquiry.

Cookies.
LEX COMPUTECH  ( LEX SYSTEM )  uses “cookies” to collect information when you visit company websites.
This information is used to give us an insight into website usage and effectiveness, improve our products and services, and to personalize your online experience.
A “cookie” can be defined as a piece of data that a website sends to your browser and that may then be stored on your computer as a hardware identifier.
Cookies are most commonly used to assess website usage – visitor numbers, length of visit – and effectiveness – pages and topics visitors are most interested in – and also to make website navigation easier.
Used in this way, cookies have no real connection to personal information.
However, cookies are sometimes used to track user preferences in order to personalize and improve user experience.
Cookies can be broken down into two groups.
"session cookies” and "persistent cookies.
” Session cookies aid efficiency and are erased when the user closes their web browser.

To do this, click on "Tools" – alternative headings may be used in different browsers – and look for information on cookies.
It’s generally possible to turn off cookies or set up a notification so that your browser warns you before you receive a cookie.
If you do this, you’ll be able to decide whether you want to accept individual cookies.
We recommend that you leave your cookies turned on as they make it possible for you to take full advantage of some of our websites' features.
If you turn off, block, or otherwise reject our cookies, some web pages may not load properly.
