Technical documentation.
Measure the conditions in each room or zone.
Our wireless multi-sensors measure and monitor the carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, ambient temperature and relative humidity in a room or zone.
The small wireless CO2 sensors simply stick onto the wall and are solar-powered using ambient room light, making them easy to install and very low maintenance.
Find out more.
Measure your room conditions with a single sensor.
Our room condition sensor measures occupancy, light, sound, temperature and humidity.
This small, discreet sensor can be mounted on a wall, ceiling or table top.
Producing near real-time, highly accurate data which you can use to ensure your room conditions are at optimum levels at all times.
Find out more.
Measure the indoor air quality in each room or zone.
Our indoor air quality (IAQ) sensor measures carbon dioxide (CO2), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM) levels, as well as temperature and humidity in a room.
Find out more.
Our wireless multi-sensors measure the ambient temperature and relative humidity in each room, cabinet or zone.
The small, solar-powered sensors use ultra-low-power wireless technology, making them easy to install and very low maintenance.
Find out more.
Our wireless door and window sensors automatically detect open doors or windows around your building, including doors on cupboards, cabinets and fridges.
The small, solar-powered contact sensors use ultra-low-power wireless technology, making them easy to install and very low maintenance.
Find out more.
Our wireless current sensors measure energy consumption at a circuit, zone or machine level, in real time.
The small, energy-harvesting sensors simply clip (CT clamp) around a cable and measure the alternating current (AC).
The wireless, battery-free devices use energy-harvesting technology making them easy to install and very low maintenance.
Find out more.
Our wireless dry contact sensors monitor the status of any equipment that has a volt-free, dry contact output, such as UPS status, security systems, fire alarms or air conditioning units.
The small, energy harvesting devices use ultra-low power wireless and battery-less technology, making them easy to install and very low maintenance.

The smart gateway receives live data from multiple sensors, converts it into easy-to-use JSON format and makes it available locally or in the cloud, via MQTT.
Enabling you to easily integrate live sensor data into your existing applications.
In simple terms, the gateway receives data from the sensors and makes it usable.

People flow sensors detect people going in and out of a doorway automatically, and in real time.
The small sensors are mounted above a single doorway and send a message each time a person enters or exits through the doorway.
You can use the data to report people flow in/out of a room in real-time or count how many people have entered or exited a room.

Industrial temperature sensors allow you to measure and monitor ambient, surface or water conditions in a room, machine or around the building, in real time.
This allows you to maintain optimum conditions and improve efficiency.
Our three-channel temperature sensors measure temperature at up to three different points, and can be used for water, air or surface temperature measurements.

Our machine temperature sensors are used to detect overheating or heat caused by friction in motors or at specific points on a machine.
We supply battery-powered three-channel sensors, which measure temperature at up to three different points, and thermal-powered sensors that measure the temperature increases of a metal surface.
