Privacy Policy.
Deutsch |  Español | Français | Português | Türkçe.
We at Level take your privacy seriously.
We know that we have a lot of information about you and want to be sure that we use it the right way.
This Privacy Policy describes how Level Benefits, Inc.
(together with its affiliates, “Level,” “we,” “our” or “us”) collects, uses, and handles your personal information when you use our websites, software, and other services (“Services”).
Your use of the Services is also subject to the Level Terms of Service available at level.
com/legal/terms.
‍1.
Protected Health Information.
When you interact with our Services, you may choose to provide personal health information, or we may receive health information about you from or on behalf of health care providers and related healthcare specialists, professionals, or organizations (“Providers”).
We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of your personal health information, and under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), we must take measures to protect the privacy of the protected health information (“PHI”) that we receive from Providers.
HIPAA and GDPR provide specific protections for the privacy and security of PHI and restricts how PHI is used and disclosed.
We may only use and disclose your PHI in compliance with HIPAA, GDPR and the agreements that we have in place with Providers and others.
2.
Controller And Processor.
The GDPR divides organizations processing personal information into two categories.
controllers and processors.
Controllers decide why and how personal information is processed.
Processors simply process personal information on behalf of controllers.
If you live in the EEA or the UK, we may act as either a controller or a processor of your personal information.
When your employer uses Level to administer benefits (in which case, you’re a “Member”), we generally act as a processor on behalf of your employer as controller in relation to the personal information we receive in providing those Services to your employer.
However, depending on what we have agreed with your employer, we may also act as a data controller of your personal information (for example, if we use it to further improve our Services).
We will also act as a data controller when administering our business relationships (for example, communicating with employers) and providing our website (for example, analysing how our website is used).
If you are a logged-in user of Level’s Services, Level Benefits, Inc.
is your service provider.
If you are otherwise accessing Level’s website or engaging with Level in a marketing capacity, Level Insurance Agency LLC is providing the Services.
We set out further information about how we use your personal information below.
3.
What We Collect.
Information You Provide.
We collect the content and other information you provide when you use our Services, including information like your name, email address, date of birth, medical information, or social security number, or document uploads like receipts, when you submit them to us.

To the extent that you disclose to us any personal information of another individual, you represent that you have obtained such individual’s consent for the disclosure of such personal information, as well as the processing of the same in accordance with this Policy.
You may also choose to provide feedback on our Services or contact us for support, and we will keep a record of that communication.
Information Provided About You.
If you are a Member, we may receive information about you from Providers, your employer, or other third parties involved in providing the Services to you.

For purposes of this section, Nonpublic Personal Information means information that identifies you and is not available to the public.
If you are located in the EEA or the UK, you have the following additional rights.
Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request").
This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you.
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal information.
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law.
Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
Request restriction of processing of your personal information.
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios.
If you want us to establish the information's accuracy.
Where our use of the information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
Where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
You have objected to our use of your information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party.
We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information.
However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.
We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Where we act as a processor on behalf of your employer, we may need to cooperate with your employer in responding to your request to exercise your rights.
Alternatively, your employer may choose to handle your request itself.
