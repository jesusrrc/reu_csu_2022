This Privacy Policy outlines how Tobii generally handles your personal data.
In connection with some of our services, we will give you more specific information about our handling of your personal data, and we will, where appropriate, ask for your consent before handling your personal data.
At the end of this policy, there is information on how to contact us if you have any questions or if you think anything is unclear.
Please note that this policy only covers Tobii’s use of personal data.
Sometimes, other companies buy or license our technology and use it to handle personal data as part of their service offering.
In such cases you should refer to the privacy policies of those respective businesses.
1.
What we collect.
Depending on which services you use, we process different kinds of information from or about you.
Please note that some of our services may handle types of personal data that are not listed in this privacy policy.
In those cases, we will however always notify you clearly in connection with your use of such service.
Here's how.
Personal data and other information you (and others) give us.
We collect the information that you (and others) give us when using our services.
For example.
• When you register to use our services, we may ask for information such as your name, email address and phone number.
• For many of our services, you will have the opportunity to create a user profile (for example in one of our web-based services) and add information to your profile after registration.

• Depending on which services you use, you have the option of submitting information about your physical features, such as information about your eyes and disabilities concerning your eyes, or other health related data.
• If you seek customer support for one of our services, then it's sometimes necessary for us to access your personal information to be able to help you with your problem (for example if we need to remotely control your device to troubleshoot).
In those cases, we will either delete the data once the support matter has been resolved (as in the remote control case), or store the data according to applicable retention routines within the Tobii Group, if we find that either you or Tobii has a legitimate interest in doing so.

• Create accounts and user profiles.
• Communicate with you about our services.
• Provide technical support.

The following can see information about you when you and others use our services.

We may share information about you with these partners so they can provide you with the experiences that you've requested, such as.
• Information in your Tobii profile and about how you use our services.

10.
What is our legal basis for processing data.
The legal ground for processing personal data varies depending on the types of data and the situation.
The legal grounds we rely on at Tobii are the following.
• If processing is necessary to fulfill our contract with you, i.
e.
what we are obliged to provide under the agreement between you and us.
Our obligations to you vary depending on the service you are using.
For example, we may need to store your name and address to keep track of our warranty obligations to you.
• With your consent, which you may withdraw at any time.
For example, when you have given your consent for Tobii to use your eye images and other personal data to develop our algorithms and thus our products.
It should be noted that a withdrawal of a consent shall, and cannot, affect the lawfulness of processing that has already been carried out based on that consent before its withdrawal.
• As necessary to comply with our legal obligations.
for example, Tobii must store some purchase information to comply with tax and accounting regulations.
The legal ground for this processing (storing) is therefore necessary for compliance with legal obligations.
• Occasionally to protect your vital interests or those of others.
On rare occasions, we may process your data if doing so is necessary to protect your vital interests.
For example, in situations where there is an immediate risk to your health we may share information with your caregiver.
• As necessary for our (or others) legitimate interests.
Tobii has a legitimate interest in providing an innovative, personalized, safe and profitable service to our existing and future users and partners, unless those interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protection of personal data.
