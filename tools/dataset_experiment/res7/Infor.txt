However, many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service.
If you choose not to provide that necessary data, you will not be able to use that product or feature.
Similarly, where we need personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, we will not be able to proceed if you do not provide the data.
We will let you know if not providing the personal data will result in our inability to provide you with a product or service.

Infor complies with the EU-U.
S.
Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.
S.
Privacy Shield Framework (Privacy Shield) as set forth by the U.
S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom and/or Switzerland to the United States in reliance on Privacy Shield.
Infor (US) has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit  The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Infor’s compliance with Privacy Shield.
In certain situations, Infor may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
As a result of the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-311/18 (“Schrems II”) on July 16, 2020, the Privacy Shield Framework is no longer suitable as a mechanism to ensure the lawfulness of transfers of Personal Data from the EU, UK and Switzerland to the US.
We maintain adherence to this Framework as required to maintain our Privacy Shield certification, and particularly with regard to personal data already transferred from the EU, UK or Switzerland to the US.
We continue to ensure the lawful transfer of personal data from the EU, UK and Switzerland to the US through alternative mechanisms such as the Standard Contractual Clauses, as approved by the European Commission.
Standard Contractual Clauses were not invalidated by the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union as a lawful transfer mechanism.
We are monitoring the situation as it develops and will update this information with any amendments needed to remain compliant.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data security concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at  Under certain conditions, an individual may invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding Privacy Shield compliance not resolved by any of the other Privacy Shield mechanisms.
.
Infor has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.
Infor shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Infor proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Infor’s privacy practices, described in this Privacy Policy, also comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System.
The APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies.
More information about the APEC framework can be found here.
