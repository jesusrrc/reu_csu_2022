In these circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee or may refuse to act on the request.
We will advise an individual of any fees prior to proceeding with a request.
We may ask for additional information to verify an individual's identity before carrying out a request.
Where we do not carry out a request, we shall inform the individual without delay and within one month of receipt of the request, providing our reasons for not taking the action requested.

Whether or not we process personal data about them.
Certain specified information about the processing.
Individuals also have a right to access the personal data and be provided with a copy.
6.
2          Right to restrict processing of personal data.
Individuals have the right to request that we restrict processing of their personal data where one of the following applies.
An individual contests the accuracy of the personal data.
The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify the accuracy of the personal data.
The processing is unlawful but an individual does not want the personal data to be erased and requests restriction instead.
We no longer require the personal data for the purposes of processing, but it is still required by an individual in connection with a legal claim.
An individual has exercised their right to object to the processing.
The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.
6.
3          Right to object to processing of personal data.
Where personal data is used to target marketing to an individual, they have the right to object to this at any stage.
An individual also has the right to object to processing of their personal data where the legal basis of the processing is our legitimate interests.

6.

There are also certain exceptions where we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where the personal data is required to comply with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
If an individual does request erasure of their personal data, this will potentially remove records which we hold for their benefit, such as their presence on a suppression list and they will have to contact us to provide personal information if they wish for us to hold this in future.
6.
6          Right to Data Portability.
Where we are relying upon the legal basis either of consent or that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which an individual is a party, and that personal data is processed by automatic means (e.
g.

6.
