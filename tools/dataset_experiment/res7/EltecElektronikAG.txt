newsletters are sent out by the mailing service provider MailChimp, a newsletter mailing platform of the company The Rocket Science Group, LLC in the USA.
The privacy policy of MailChimp can be viewed here.

The mailing service provider may use the recipient's data to optimize or improve its own services, e.

for the technical optimization of dispatch and the presentation of the newsletter or for statistical purposes.
However, the mailing service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write to them itself or to pass on the data to third parties.
Statistical evaluation proceduresThe newsletters contain a so-called web beacon, i.
e.
a one-pixel file which is retrieved from our server when the newsletter is opened, or, if we use a mailing service provider, from its server.
Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information is first collected, such as-  date and time of retrieval,-  information about the recipient's browser and system,-  IP addressThis information is used for the technical improvement of the services on the basis of technical data or target groups and their reading behavior on the basis of retrieval locations (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or access times.
Statistical surveys also include determining whether newsletters are opened, when they are opened, and which links are clicked, which is documented with a star rating.
This information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients due to technical reasons.
It is, however, neither our endeavor nor, if used, that of the mailing service provider to observe individual users.
The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.
