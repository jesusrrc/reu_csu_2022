Taxes.
Unless otherwise stated, you are responsible for any                                taxes or duties associated with your Subscription, including any                                related penalties or interest (collectively, “Taxes”).
Subscription fees are calculated and due without any reduction for                                Taxes.
If Sturfee is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes                                will be invoiced to you unless you provide Sturfee with a timely                                and valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate                                taxing authority.
In some states the sales tax is due on the total                                purchase price at the time of sale and must be invoiced and                                collected at the time of the sale.
If you are required by                                applicable law to withhold any Taxes from your payment to Sturfee,                                you must provide Sturfee with an official tax receipt or other                                appropriate documentation to support such withholding.
