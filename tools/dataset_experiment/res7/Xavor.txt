Cookies – A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user.
Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.
We use session ID cookies.
For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.
Cookies are used to maintain the identity of users with our site after users log in with a username and password.
This allows the users to identify themselves (log in) once rather than multiple times per web session.
You can choose to disable cookies by following the procedure suggested by your particular browser.
If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you may still be able to access our site depending on where you are in our site.
Log Files – We gather certain information about the use of our site by our visitors using a process that does not by itself identify a specific individual.
This information is then compiled and analyzed in a way that does not identify our visitors personally.
The information may include the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) a visitor of our site has just come from, which URLs have been visited within our site, what browser is being used, and what Internet Protocol (IP) address a visitor used to get to our site.
Third Parties – Except as specifically described in this privacy policy, we will not, without your specific prior consent, sell, trade or transfer your personally identifiable information to such third parties other than authorized third parties and others involved in the e-commerce distribution chain (e.
g.
, vendors, suppliers), which may need access to some of your personal information.

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
Security – When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information such as credit card number and billing information, that information is encrypted and is protected with industry standard encryption technology – SSL.
While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, to indicate secure transmission mode, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure proper use of your information, we and our Web server hosts have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users should contact us.

If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 18 we will delete that information ourselves.
Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information – If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information.
This can be done in the users account accessed by username and password or by contacting us.
Notification of Changes – If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
If, however, we are going to use our users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days.
Severability – In the event any of the provisions of this privacy policy are held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will be unimpaired and the unenforceable provision(s) will be replaced by such enforceable provision(s) as comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision(s).
Contact Information – If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at.
