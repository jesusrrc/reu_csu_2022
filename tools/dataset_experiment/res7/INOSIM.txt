, contact and communications data, application documents, notes taken during job interviews, etc.
), if they are required to make a decision concerning the establishment or an employment relationship.
The legal grounds for the aforementioned are § 26 New GDPR according to German Law (Negotiation of an Employment Relationship), Art.

6 para.
1 lit.

Afterwards the data will be deleted, and the physical application documents will be destroyed.
The storage serves in particular as evidence in the event of a legal dispute.
If it is evident that the data will be required after the expiry of the 6-month period (e.

Longer storage may also take place if you have given your agreement (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR) or if statutory data retention requirements preclude the deletion.
Our social media appearances.
Data processing through social networks.
We maintain publicly available profiles in social networks.
The individual social networks we use can be found below.
Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter etc.
can generally analyze your user behavior comprehensively if you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.
g.
like buttons or banner ads).
When you visit our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant processing operations are triggered.
In detail.
If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media page, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account.
Under certain circumstances, your personal data may also be recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal.
In this case, this data is collected, for example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.
Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which their preferences and interests are stored.
This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and outside of your social media presence.
If you have an account with the social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on any device you are logged in to or have logged in to.
Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the social media portals.
Depending on the provider, additional processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media portals.
Details can be found in the terms of use and privacy policy of the respective social media portals.
Legal basis.
Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on the Internet.
This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art.
6 (1) lit.
f GDPR.
The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may be based on divergent legal bases to be specified by the operators of the social networks (e.
g.
consent within the meaning of Art.
6 (1) (a) GDPR).
Responsibility and assertion of rights.
If you visit one of our social media sites (e.
g.
, Facebook), we, together with the operator of the social media platform, are responsible for the data processing operations triggered during this visit.
You can in principle protect your rights (information, correction, deletion, limitation of processing, data portability and complaint) vis-à-vis us as well as vis-à-vis the operator of the respective social media portal (e.
g.
Facebook).
Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals.
Our options are determined by the company policy of the respective provider.
Storage time.
The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon as the purpose for their storage lapses, you ask us to delete it, you revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses.
Stored cookies remain on your device until you delete them.
Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular, retention periods – remain unaffected.
We have no control over the storage duration of your data that are stored by the social network operators for their own purposes.
For details, please contact the social network operators directly (e.
g.
in their privacy policy, see below).
