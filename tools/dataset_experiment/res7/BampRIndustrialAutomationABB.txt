Who receives and processes your personal data (within and outside the EU and EEA).
We will only share your personal data with employees and third parties directly involved in the recruitment process, in particular in the country in which you have applied for the job or in countries directly involved in the respective recruitment process.
As part of a global corporation, we have business relationships with companies in the B&R Group and external service providers, both within and outside the European Economic Area (EEA), which we may also use to process your personal data.
We will generally only share your personal data with other B&R companies or third parties if this is necessary for the purposes listed in the table below.
In this regard, your personal data may also be made available to companies of the B&R Group in countries within and outside of the EEA for the aforementioned processing purposes.

If we share your personal data with a B&R company or third party and it is transferred or becomes accessible outside the European Union ("EU") and the European Economic Area ("EEA") or outside the country of your employer, we will protect your personal data with appropriate safeguards.
Examples of such safeguards include decisions on adequacy of protection by the European Commission or Standard Contractual Clauses.

How long do we process and store your personal data.
We generally process and store your personal data only as long as is necessary for the processing purposes stated in this notice, until you withdraw your consent granted under Art.
6 (1) a) of the GDPR or until you object to the use of your personal data if a legitimate interest is the legal basis for processing (Art.
6 (1) f) of the GDPR).
However, legal provisions require B&R to store certain personal data for minimum retention periods.
This concerns, for example, employment contracts, information about remuneration and reimbursement of costs, for which minimum retention periods apply on the basis of company and tax law regulations.
In addition, national anti-discrimination laws such as the Austrian Federal Equal Treatment Act, which gives you specific rights in connection with the recruitment process, require that we store your personal data for the period during which you can make claims on the basis of anti-discrimination laws.
At the same time, the applicable data protection laws require that we store and process your personal data in a form that identifies you for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which the personal data was collected and that we carry out regular checks in this regard.
Although there may be limited exceptions due to national legal provisions (e.
g.
tax or commercial law), your personal data will generally be processed for the following retention periods.
If your application has been rejected, the recruitment process ends with the rejection notification and your personal data will be stored and processed for another 6 months, for example in Austria, unless you have given us your consent to consider you for future jobs and to store and process your personal data for these purposes.
If your application has been successful, the recruitment process ends with the conclusion of your employment contract and we will continue to process your personal data for the duration of this contract and/or the retention periods specified in the privacy notice applicable to you and your employment contract.
If you have given us your consent to consider you for further job offers and to store and process your personal data for these purposes, we will store and process your personal data for a maximum retention period of 24 months.
After the applicable retention period has expired, we will delete your personal data or make it anonymous, unless there are special circumstances that require us to retain your personal data, such as legal or regulatory requirements or legal disputes in connection with your employment.
Through settings in IT systems and guidelines, we ensure that your personal data is deleted as soon as it is no longer needed.
For further information about the retention periods applicable to your personal data, please send a request to .
