We do not sell, rent or disclose your personal identifying                    information to any third party, except as described in this section.
We may contract                    with reputable vendors to assist us in processing information or delivering the                    items that you may request.

Your Use.
By using this website, you agree not to disrupt or intercept                    our electronic information posted on this website or on any of our servers.
You                    also agree not to attempt to circumvent any security features of our website, and                    to abide by all applicable, local, state, federal and international laws.
In the section of our website that allow you to access trial downloads, service                    patches and other registered customer materials, we do ask for some personal information,                    such as name, mailing address and e-mail address, but this information will only                    be used by Inflectra to supply these materials to you or contact you, if necessary,                    to respond to your request for information and to contact you directly to respond                    to questions, comments or inquiries.

Children.
Inflectra strongly believes in protecting the privacy                    of children online (we define "children" as minors younger than 13).
Therefore,                    Inflectra will not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children                    or knowingly allow children to register with us.
Any information that is inadvertently                    collected from children will be deleted promptly upon discovery.
Security.
Inflectra always uses industry-standard encryption technologies                    when transferring and receiving data exchanged with our website.
Inflectra has implemented                    appropriate security measures in our physical facilities to protect against the                    loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our                    website.
Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed                    to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information,                    we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or                    from our website, and you do so at your own risk.
Once we receive your transmission,                    we will do our best to protect its security on our systems.
IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT                    OF AN INTERCEPTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DESPITE OUR EFFORTS, INFLECTRA SHALL NOT                    BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH INTERCEPTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, OR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,                    SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) SUFFERED                    BY A CUSTOMER OR USER, EVEN IF INFLECTRA HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY                    OF SUCH DAMAGES.
INFLECTRA DOES NOT WARRANT, EITHER EXPRESSLY OR IMPLIEDLY, THAT                    THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY ANY CUSTOMER SHALL BE FREE FROM INTERCEPTION OR UNAUTHORIZED                    ACCESS, AND DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS                    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
EACH CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE CONFIDENTIALITY                    OF HIS OR HER INFORMATION.
(European Union) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was created to align the data privacy laws across all EU countries.
The GDPR came into effect in May 25th, 2018 and replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC.
A major update within the GDPR is that the processing of any EU citizens’ information is now protected, regardless of whether the information processing is done within the EU or not, and regardless of where the data controller is located.
If you are a citizen of the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA) and are using the Inflectra website,                    we will maintain your personal data in accordance with the principles of the GDPR as outlined in                    Appendix A of this privacy policy.
Choice / opt–out.
During initial user registration, users can choose whether they wish to share their information                            with authorized third parties located in the same geography to aid in the software evaluation process.
Users always have the opportunity to opt–out or change preferences via a link in the footer of all non–transactional email messages.
These options are made available in email messages delivered from our company.

g.
important account notifications, evaulation support information and billing information) are considered transactional                            and are necessary for all Inflectra customers and users.
