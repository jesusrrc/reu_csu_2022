Retaining your data.
In most circumstances your data will not be retained for more than 6 years from the last point at which we provided any services or otherwise engaged with you and it is our policy to only store your personal  data for as long as is reasonably necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations and for our legitimate business interests.
However, we may retain data for longer than a 6 year period where we have a legal or contractual obligation to do so, or we form the view that there is otherwise a continued basis to do so, for example where your personal information identifies specialist skill sets which may remain in demand, or we are subject to a legal obligation which applies for a longer period.
If however, you believe that we should delete your personal data at an earlier date, please inform us in writing of your reasons.
Please see Section 4 ‘Your Rights’ below.
