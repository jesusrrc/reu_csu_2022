What we do.
1.
4 We are engaged in the development of NB-Fi communication technology and the development, implementation and support of utility metering devices (hereinafter referred to as the Resources) – electricity, water, heat, gas meters and other devices (probes and sensors), as well as modems for connection to such devices sending data using NB-Fi technology (hereinafter also referred to as the Device).
The devices collect data on the amount of Resources consumed and data from probes and sensors and send them to servers for storage and processing.
Software is installed on the servers (hereinafter also referred to as the Software), which processes the data received, structures it and demonstrates the processing results through the personal account on  or on subdomains of this website (hereinafter referred to as the Website), as well as via mobile applications developed by the Operator for use on devices with Android or iOS operating systems, and published by the Operator in the online stores of the corresponding operating systems (hereinafter referred to as the Mobile Application), to you or the company that accepts the data on the Resources consumed, or payment for the Resources consumed (for example, a resource-supplying organization or an organization that manages your apartment building, condominium, cottage village, etc.
), or data from other devices that transmit data to the server (hereinafter referred to as the Supplier).
This allows you to control the amount of Resources you consume, eliminates the need to take readings from the meters yourself and report them to the Suppliers, or let representatives of the Suppliers to the apartment to do it for you, as well as receive data from other Devices that transmit data to our server.
Who you are.

You are an adult in the territory of the European Union who.
(a) has purchased and installed the Device or lives in the premises where the Device is installed, and.
(b) intends to use the Device and Software and/or the Website or the Mobile Application for their functional purpose, and.
(c) has entered or will enter into an agreement with us on the use of the Software and/or the Website and the Mobile Application (hereinafter referred to as the Terms and Conditions), and/or.
(d) has entered into or will enter into an agreement with the Supplier (or a person similar to it), under the terms of which the Supplier transfers Resources to you (or provides/arranges such transfer in your interests), and you pay for them (hereinafter referred to as the Agreement), or you permanently or temporarily live in the premises, the owner/legal owner of which has entered into the Agreement.
