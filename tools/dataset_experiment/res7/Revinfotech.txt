For example, a user could include information about you in a review they post.
Automatically Collected InformationWe and third parties may use automated means to collect information about you, your computer or other devices, and your use of the Services.
These automated means include technologies such as cookies, Web server logs, Web beacons, and JavaScript.
Cookies are files that websites and online services create and access on your computer or other Internet-connected devices to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings on your device to help us recognize you, improve your experience, increase security, and measure the use of our Services.
Our Services may use HTTP cookies, HTML5 cookies, Flash cookies and other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage).
Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies.
Please note, however, that without cookies or local storage you may not be able to use all of the features of our Services.
In conjunction with the gathering of information through cookies and other automated means, Web servers may log information such as your device type, operating system type, mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device operating system, browser type, domain, and other system settings, the name of your ISP or mobile carrier, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located.
The Web server logs also may record information such as the address of the Web page that referred you to our Services and the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.
They also may log information about your interaction with our Services, such as which pages you visit.
To control which Web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags on our Web pages called “Web beacons,” which are files that link Web pages to particular Web servers and their cookies.
We also may include Web beacons in e-mail messages.
We or third parties also may send instructions to your device using JavaScript or other computer languages to store or gather other details about your interactions with the Services.
We may also collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.
g.
, IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.
g.
, GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services), and may use that information to customize the Services with location-based information, advertising, and features.
For example, if you provide a zip code that indicates that you live in California, the Services may be customized with California-specific information and advertisements.
In order to do this, your location information may be passed along to our agents, vendors or advertisers.
If you access the Services through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with GPS location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this.
See your device manufacturer’s instructions for further details.
