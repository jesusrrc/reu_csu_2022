we do not currently sell, and we will not sell your personal information for twelve months from the date of the last review of this Privacy Policy.
The type, sensitivity, and value of the personal information collected and maintained about the consumer, as applicable law requires a more stringent verification process for sensitive or valuable personal information.
The risk of harm to the consumer posed by any unauthorized access or deletion.
The likelihood that fraudulent or malicious actors would seek the personal information.
Whether the personal information to be provided by the consumer to verify their identity is sufficiently robust to protect against fraudulent requests or being spoofed or fabricated.
The manner in which the business interacts with the consumer.
Available technology for verification.
and.
Other factors that may be reasonable if the circumstances are consistent with industry practice, are recommended by California government officials, or which may be required by law or regulation following the effective date of this Privacy Policy.
If your request is regarding household information, the same verification steps above are required before we can provide you with aggregate household information.
For us to process a request for access to or deletion of specific pieces of information regarding your household, all members of the household must make the request, and we must be able to verify each household member.
In some cases, we may not have sufficient information about you or your household to be able to verify your identity or sufficiently differentiate you from another consumer or household to the degree of certainty required by law, in which case, we will not be able to act upon your request.
In such cases, it may be unlikely that we would be able to identify you or your household in the future without collecting significantly more information or seeking to reidentify deidentified information.
At this time, we do not intend to take such steps in response to a request made pursuant to this Privacy Policy and applicable law does not require that we do so.
If, in the future, we determine a reasonable method to identify you or your household absent such steps, we will provide an update to you through this Privacy Policy and in response to any such request at that time.
Information that you submit for the purpose of allowing us to verify your identity in furtherance of a consumer-related or household-related request pursuant to California law will only be used by us, and our service providers if any, for that purpose and no other.
Except where we are required by law to maintain such information for record-keeping purposes, we will take steps to delete any new personal information collected for the purpose of verification as soon as practical after processing your request.
Please also be aware that making any such request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal or deletion of Personal Information or content you may have posted, and there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow us to fulfill your request, including, for example, where fulfilling your request may infringe upon the rights and freedoms of other consumers.
We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee or take other appropriate action in response to requests from a consumer or household that are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character.
You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf pursuant to applicable law.
We accept documentation of your designation in the form of a valid power of attorney and/or a notarized statement.
You must submit evidence of your designation of an authorized agent in writing to.
iRhythm Technologies, Inc.
