BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE DATA CONTROLLER.
1.
1 Data controller/processor.
This Privacy Policy regulates the data processing by GRAPHISOFT, and it is therefore GRAPHISOFT who generally qualifies as data controller in respect of your personal data.
There are however certain cases where GRAPHISOFT does not act as a data controller but instead acts as a subordinate of another data controller, which case GRAPHISOFT is understood to be a data processor (acting on behalf of another controller while processing the personal data – in such case GRAPHISOFT proceeds in accordance and based on the instructions of the data controller and processes data only to the extent as prescribed by the data controller).
Please also note that GRAPHISOFT operates and provides its services with close cooperation with its subsidiaries, distributors and resellers (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS”), therefore the electronic systems of GRAPHISOFT (where most of our products are marketed and are available) are designed to share the relevant information with GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS.
Based on this system structure it may occur that the data processed by GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS are shared with GRAPHISOFT PARNTERS or GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS share personal information with GRAPHISOFT.
In all cases internal policies and procedures furthermore agreements regulate the access to the databases to ensure that while we aim to provide the best service possible all data processing are in compliance with the legal regulations.
List of GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS and their contact details are available here.

3 Designation of data protection officer.
Please note that GRAPHISOFT examined the need to appoint a data protection officer according to Article 37 of the GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC, GDPR) and drew the conclusion that GRAPHISOFT is not required to do so in light of the mandatory appointment criteria, in particular, GRAPHISOFT’s core activities do not include processing operations which, by virtue of their nature, their scope and/or their purposes, require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale.
However, since GRAPHISOFT has always added considerable weight to the privacy of personal data, GRAPHISOFT appoints a data protection officer and dedicated sufficient staff, resources to ensure that it is able to discharge its obligations under the GDPR.

GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS use the online ordering system of GRAPHISOFT and when using it may fill in certain personal information about you.

In such case the GRAPHISOFT PARTNER is the data controller and GRAPHISOFT is only data processor of the partner in order to provide the electronic ordering system.
These transfers will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
6.
2 Also, since many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) (such as Microsoft, Inc.
, Digital Ocean, Inc.
, Salesforce.
com, Inc.
), so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
For further details, see European Commission.
Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
(b) where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
For further details, see European Commission.
Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
(c) where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
