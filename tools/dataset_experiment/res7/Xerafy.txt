ABOUT XERAFY.
Xerafy was founded by a team of experienced RFID tag developers who got together to solve the problems faced by industrial customers.
Customers needed to manage small assets like hands tools, manufacturing molds, industrial equipment, medical devices.
They wanted tags small enough to embed or attach to their assets but rugged enough to survive the extreme temperatures, humidity, and rough handling that are the norm in industrial environments.
The traditional bar codes solutions available had already demonstrated too many limitations including line-of-sight, distance, automation, and durability.
​.
The Xerafy team came together to develop a breakthrough Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) design.
Unlike others, it would take advantage of the metal in its surrounding, instead of being limited by it.
Industrial RFID was born, with the world’s smallest and most rugged on-metal tag coming to markets in 2010.
Incremental innovations in passive tags have since expanded the scope of what is possible in Industrial RFID.
The company decided to name themselves Xerafy to symbolize the smallest EPC UHF RAIN RFID tag to verify and quantify assets.
​.
Since then, our technology has been distinguished by EY, Frost & Sullivan, GS1, RFID Journal, AIconics, and Red Herring.
