Zenlayer as a Data Processor for EU/EEA and Switzerland Customers.
When providing infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Zenlayer may process personal data controlled by its customers or customers of Zenlayer entities located in the European Union/European Economic Area (“EU/EEA”).
Zenlayer does not determine or have knowledge of the types of data stored by customers or how that data is accessed, exchanged, processed, or the classification of that data.
Zenlayer customers are the data controllers of such personal data and are responsible for compliance with applicable data protection laws.
Zenlayer processes data as a data processor at the direction of its customers in accordance with the terms of the MSA.
The provision of IaaS may, at the direction of the customer, include the transfer by the customer of its customers’ personal data outside of the EEA to jurisdictions which may not provide the same level of legal protection as in the EEA.
The customer is responsible for ensuring that it has all necessary consents and agreements in place with data subjects for international transfers of personal data that it directs as part of its receipt of IaaS.
The terms “personal data,” “process,” “data controller,” “data processor,” and “data subject” have the meanings given to them in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
On occasion, employees of Zenlayer may have temporary access to customer content in connection with providing maintenance or support services to you.
This access will only be accomplished by way of your explicit permission and instructions (as the controller of the customer content) and only for so long as the employee is providing services to you.
As a processor, Zenlayer will not access the customer content for any purpose beyond providing you with support as described above and will not disclose it to any person or entity.

You have the right to (i) object at any time to the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes and (ii) object to our processing of your personal information where the legal ground of such processing is necessary for legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
We will then abide by your request unless we can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for the processing• Restriction.
You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal information in certain circumstances, such as when you contest the accuracy of that personal information• Withdrawal of consent.
If we rely on your consent (or explicit consent) as our legal basis for processing your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
"Explicit consent" would be required if the Zenlayer relies on consent as the condition to lawfully process "special categories of personal data," as defined in the GDPR.
Please note that some of these rights may be limited where we have an overriding interest or legal obligation to continue to process your personal information or where data may be exempt from disclosure due to professional secrecy obligations.
If you are in the EEA and would like to exercise any of these rights, please.

Do Not Track Disclosures (DNT).
Various browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a DNT option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header that sends a signal to websites visited by the browser user about the user's DNT preference.
You can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's preferences.
