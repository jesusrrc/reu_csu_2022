Privacy policy Codian Robotics 05/2018Responsible for data processing in connection with our website.
Codian Robotics BVKelperlaan 246716 BS EDE – NL.
The data protection officer can be contacted by e-mail at and by mail at Keplerlaan 24, 6716 BS, EDE NL.
For Codian Robotics, it is especially important to guarantee the maximum possible protection for your individual personal data.
Our Internet activities in all the countries where we maintain websites are, therefore, in accordance with the data-protection and data-security laws that are applicable there.
In the following text, we indicate what information we gather and what we do with it.
Personal data.
We do not collect any personal data via our Websites without your consent.
You alone decide whether you wish to disclose this data or not, for instance in the course of registration, a request or other such procedure.
We use your personal data in order to respond to a request, process your order or to grant you access to special information or quotations.
In the interests of nurturing customer relationships, it may also be beneficial for us to store and process your personal data and pass it to the company in the country you have indicated in your request.
We store IP addresses for a maximum of 14 days.
This information is stored for data integrity reasons, so that we are able to ensure the stability and operational reliability of our system.
If you do not wish to divulge your personal data to us within the context of fostering our customer relationship (and particularly for the purposes of direct marketing or market research), we will of course respect your wishes.
We will not sell your personally identifiable information.
When you enter data on forms, you do so voluntarily.
However, your consent to the collection, storage and processing of your data can be revoked by you at any time.
The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.
Newsletter.
We use your personal data collected within the framework of the newsletter registration.
By giving us your name, you enable us to address you personally and simplify the management of your data.
Furthermore, we are continuously focussed on improving our range of products and services.
This also includes an evaluation of the newsletter we send out, e.
g.
whether the indicated e-mail address is actually accessible, which newsletters are opened, which links are clicked within the newsletter, and whether a response ((automatic) reply, error message, etc.
) has been generated.
The data is collected and processed exclusively by Codian Robotics.
The data is not communicated to other external companies, except for newsletter purposes.
Before using the newsletter service, you consent to the use of your e-mail address and of the other data requested there.
This data is used for the purposes of recommending individual product and service offers to you and to continuously improve the newsletter service.
You can revoke your consent (use of your e-mail address, use of your personal data) at any time.
You will find the instructions on how to unsubscribe in the footer of each newsletter.
The legal basis of the data processing is Art.
6 paragraph 1 lit.
a) GDPR.
Collection and use of personal data in the context of job applications.
Your data will only be collected and processed for the purpose of filling job vacancies on offer within Codian Robotics.
The company that is looking to fill a vacancy and shows its address on the invitation to submit applications is responsible for data collection in this sense, i.
e.
when an application is submitted for a specific job that is being offered.
If you apply for a specific job for which applications have been invited by a company within the Codian Robotics Group, your data will be passed on to the persons/departments responsible for human resources.
You can permanently withdraw this consent at any time by sending an e-mail to the contact person named in the job advertisement.
If you submit an unsolicited job application, your data will automatically be sent to the relevant person(s)/department(s) responsible for human resources in accordance with your particular skills, abilities, and qualifications.
Your data will then be used by the responsible persons/departments solely for the purpose of evaluating your job potential.
The legal basis of the data processing is Art.
6 paragraph 1 lit.
a) and b) GDPR.
Deletion of data.
If you have applied for a job but your data ceases to be needed for this purpose, we ensure that your data is automatically deleted from our system.
Processes have been created that guarantee automatic deletion of data when such data is no longer needed for the purpose for which we originally collected it or when the data retention period has expired.
In the event of a negative decision, your job application data will be deleted after 6 months.
If your profile is of general interest to us, we would like to include you in our standing pool of job applicants but we will, of course, ask for your consent to do so beforehand.
Your rights.
You have the right to obtain information on your personal data that we have a record of in our system.
Moreover, you have the right to delete or block impermissible data and to correct any false data that we have stored in our system.
To do so, you can send an e-mail to the contact person named in the job advertisement.
Website analyses.
Our website uses the Google analytics service so that we can analyze how people use our website and make ongoing improvements to what it provides.
For this purpose, Google saves cookies (text files) on your computer via the browser.
The user information obtained from evaluating these cookies is passed on to Google and stored for analysis purposes.
Before the information is stored, part of the IP address is deleted to safeguard the anonymity of the users.
We do not pass information concerning the use of our website to third parties.
The legal basis of data processing is Section 15 TMG and Art.
6 paragraph 1 lit.
f) GDPR to optimize the content of our website.
Codian Robotics has predominantly legal and economic interests in optimizing the content and using the website for advertising purposes.
This will require the use of cookies.
There are two ways to stop data relating to your visit being stored and evaluated.
Changing the browser settingsYou can prevent the use of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser software.
However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use all the functions of this website.
Preventing Google from collecting dataYou can prevent Google from collecting data using the „opt-out function“.
In this case, your browser will save an opt-out cookie, preventing Google from collecting session data from that point on.
If you delete your browser cookies, the Google opt-out cookie will be deleted as well and you will need to reactivate it.
Google Analytics.
We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc.
(„Google“).
Google uses cookies.
The information generated by the cookie on your use of the website is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the USA.
Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate your use of our website, compile reports on website activity and provide us with other services relating to website activity and internet usage.
This data is used to create user profiles under a pseudonym.
This website uses Google Analytics reports on demographic characteristics in which data from interest-related advertising by Google as well as visitor data from third party providers (e.
g.
age, gender and interests) is used.
This data cannot be attributed to a specific person and can be deactivated at any time using the browser settings.
We only use Google Analytics with activated IP address anonymization.
This means that your IP address will be truncated by Google within the area of Member States of the European Union or in other countries which are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the United States and truncated there.
The IP address transferred by your browser during the use of Google Analytics will not be associated with any other data held by Google.
The legal basis of data processing is Section 15 TMG and Art.
6 paragraph 1 lit.
f) GDPR to optimise the content of our website.

„How Google uses data when you use our partners‘ sites or apps“, „Usage of data for advertising purposes“, „Control the information Google uses to show you ads“ and „Determine what ads Google can show you“.
Google Tag Manager.
This website uses the Google Tag Manager.
The Google Tag Manager allows you to manage website tags from a user interface.
The Tag Manager tool itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-less domain and does not record any personal data.
The tool triggers other tags that record data in some circumstances.
Google Tag Manager does not access this data.
If a deactivation was made at the domain or cookie level, it remains in place for all tracking tags that are implemented with Google Tag Manager.
Codian Robotics is an international company and we want to provide you with contacts from a Codian Robotics Account Manager near you.
In order to accomplish that, we will add the information collected on our website, through business cards and via email, including contact information and interests, into our Company Customer Relations Management system (CRM) which is maintained for all legal entities within the Codian Robotics Group.
The Account Manager that is responsible for your region may gain access to your information in our CRM and may subsequently contact you.

Dear valued customer,.
Over the years, to ensure stability for your planning and pricing, we have absorbed most material cost fluctuations.
With the current scale of increases in the raw materials, packaging, and logistics, however, we are unable to offset the cost burden through efficiency gains alone.
We therefore will increase the list prices of our robots as per 1st of June 2022.
Current offers will of course remain valid for the duration stated on the offer.
Please contact your account manager within Codian Robotics to inform what the alteration to the list prices will mean for you.
Kindest Regards,Codian Robotics BV.
