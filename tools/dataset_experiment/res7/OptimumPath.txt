A.
Information We Collect and Receive, and How We Collect It.
In connection with the initiation and ongoing provisioning of Covered Services, as well as with our ongoing efforts to improve the quality and value of the Covered Services, we may maintain certain information related to you that you provide to us or that we collect using the cable systems ("Subscriber Information").
Certain Subscriber Information may be personally identifiable ("Personally Identifiable Information").
Personally Identifiable Information does not include, among other things, any aggregate data or other data which does not identify a particular person or information which by itself does not identify a particular person, such as your zip code, gender, IP Address, MAC address or other equipment identifiers, or certain other unique numbers or codes.
We may collect Personally Identifiable Information using the cable system in order to obtain information necessary to render our cable service or other services to our subscribers or to detect unauthorized reception of cable communications, as well as for other purposes described in this notice.
When You Interact With Us.
Subscriber Information may include information which you provide to us such as your name, service address, billing address, work address, email address, home telephone number, work telephone number, mobile phone number, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, credit card number and expiration date, bank account number, and other financial information.
In addition, as part of our normal course of business, we generate and maintain billing and account information such as your billing history, the services to which you have subscribed, your payment history, your maintenance and repair history, the kind, location, configuration, device identifiers, MAC, and IP addresses of equipment (including TV sets, set-top boxes, CableCARDs, modems, telephones, IP enabled devices) connected to our facilities.
For customer services purposes, we also may keep copies of correspondence concerning your account or records of complaints or inquiries that may be made about our service.
In addition, we may sometimes collect responses to customer satisfaction surveys for analytics and research purposes.
We may also collect information that helps us detect unauthorized use of our services.
When You Use Our Services.
We may also collect service-specific Subscriber Information depending on the Covered Services to which you subscribe.
For example.
Optimum Voice.
If you are a subscriber of a covered Altice voice service such as Optimum Voice (which is an interconnected Voice-over-Internet Protocol "VoIP" service), we may collect customer proprietary network information ("CPNI").
CPNI is information that relates to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of use of an interconnected VoIP service or telecommunications service subscribed to by any customer, and that is made available to the carrier by the customer solely by virtue of the provider-customer relationship.
and information contained in the bills pertaining to interconnected VoIP service, telephone exchange service or telephone toll service received by a customer.
CPNI does not include the "subscriber list information" we collect, which includes your name, address, and telephone number that has been published or accepted for publication in any directory format, as well as (for business listings) your primary advertising classifications.
The disclosure and use of CPNI is subject to specialized restrictions as described in Section F below.
Internet Service, including Optimum Online and Optimum WiFi Hotspots.
If you subscribe to a covered Altice high-speed Internet service such as Optimum Online, we may collect broadband data, including information regarding geolocation and/or service usage, including bandwidth used (including for specific third party website traffic and app usage), system and connection performance, browsers used, device type, device identifiers, dates and times of access, and internet resource requests/browsing history (such as a log of visited URLs).
We may maintain records of Internet Protocol addresses and email accounts that we assign to you, as well as any violations or alleged violations of applicable terms and conditions of usage.
Additional information about our privacy practices specific to our high-speed Internet service, including more detail regarding data collection, can be found in the Additional Privacy Information for High Speed Internet Service.

Information Provided to Us by Third Parties.
Sometimes, we also obtain additional information from publicly available sources such as research consultants, data service providers, and marketing firms to supplement the information we collect from you.
From time to time, we may combine this publicly available information with information that we collect from you.
In addition, we may also obtain information from our business partners and/or their service providers or clients, to assist with data collection, reporting and ad response measurement, as well as to assist with delivering and analyzing the performance of relevant marketing messages and advertisements.

We may use Subscriber Information to generate de-identified or aggregated information - that is, data from which Personally Identifiable Information has been removed.
We may also employ automated processes to generate de-identified or aggregated information from any of our Covered Services.
De-identified or aggregated information does not identify you in a personal way, and our collection, use, and disclosure of de-identified or aggregate information is not subject to any of the restrictions in this notice and its use and disclosure is subject to our discretion.
For example, we may use de-identified or aggregated information for purposes such as measurement of viewership of programming and advertising, creation of tuning and viewing cohorts or segmentations, providing targeted content for our services or facilitating delivery of relevant third party advertising/promotional messages through our Covered Services and on third party websites and other platforms.
We may use certain Subscriber Information, including viewing activity and other use of the cable system (as described in Section A above), broadband data (also as described in Section A) and Personally Identifiable Information, for marketing or analytics purposes.
Such use may include facilitating display ads for our products and services shown to you on other websites and web services across the Internet.
When we do this, we may provide third party service providers with access to certain of your Personally Identifiable Information in order to place de-identified coded data into cookies on your browser (or employ similar technology), and to provide you with more relevant offers and updates through display media.
If you are a digital cable television or internet subscriber, we may use de-identified viewing activity or usage data that we have collected and/or IP address(es) we assign to subscribers, in combination with data we receive or license from third parties (such as data collected when you visit or log in to third party websites or engage in offline transactions), to deliver television and digital ads to audiences based on demographic information (e.
g.
, gender or household size) and/or interest information (e.
g.
, travel or sports) across different screens and platforms.
We may also work with third party data and service providers who de-identify data we hold to facilitate this advertising and link it to the above third party data.
You can opt out of certain marketing messages as described in the Access and Choice section below.
Our use of certain Subscriber Information associated with voice service however, is limited as described in Section F below.
Individuals who may be authorized to have access to Personally Identifiable Information include our employees, agents, and affiliates within our family of affiliated businesses though we seek to limit access to individuals on a need to know basis.
Sometimes, we may provide access to certain Personally Identifiable Information to select third parties to assist us in providing services or for other legitimate business purposes.
For example, we may provide access to certain information to companies providing services to us, including installation and repair, billing, call center, sales and marketing, market research, fulfilment, mailings, data storage, data scrubbing, data analytics and processing, bill collection, auditing and accounting, credit reporting, and legal services.
We may also provide access to third parties who assist us in providing targeted advertising and audience analysis services, opportunities and initiatives.
We will provide access to CPNI (a term described in Section A above) for use in sales and marketing only to our agents and affiliates.
The frequency of such access depends on our business needs.

Where we offer our own location-based applications, we provide you with notice and choice about whether specific location-tracking features available on your device are turned on.
Many types of wireless applications and services use device location data, including applications provided by other companies and wireless device operating systems.
When you are considering new third party applications or services, you should carefully review the location-based services' or application providers' privacy policies to learn how they collect and use your information.

) and its affiliates.
We use the term "visitor" to refer to a person who accesses any part of the website for any amount of time.
We may collect, maintain, and access certain information you provide and information collected from your use of the website and services available through the website.
This visitor information may include information that can be associated with you personally ("Personally Identifiable Information").
Visitor information may include, among other things, your first and last name, your home addresses, and your telephone number, your Altice account information, and your payment card information.
We will collect Personally Identifiable Information about you when you voluntarily provide it to us.
When you use website features that ask you for certain information, for example, when you use the Contact Us feature, you provide Personally Identifiable Information.
You can navigate through the website without giving us Personally Identifiable Information, but certain activities are only available to our subscribers who log in.
We may also collect Personally Identifiable Information if we survey visitors about various topics, including their television viewing preferences and how we can improve our programming, website, and services.
Responding to any such survey is entirely voluntary.
Sometimes, we also obtain additional information from publicly available sources such as research consultants, data service providers, and marketing firms to supplement your information.
From time to time, we may combine this publicly available information with information that we collect from you.
Personally Identifiable Information does not include aggregated data, anonymized information, or other information that does not identify a particular person.
Your zip code and gender are examples of types of data we collect that are not Personally Identifiable Information.
We may generate anonymized or aggregated information from the information we collect.

Our collection, use, and disclosure of anonymized and aggregated information are not subject to any of the restrictions in this Privacy Notice.
Anonymized or aggregated information may include, among other things, Internet server and browser identification, the Internet service provider, duration of visit, and domain type.
This aggregated information will not reveal any Personally Identifiable Information about any specific visitor.
We may also collect visitor information in the following ways.
Cookies.
Similar to most website operators, we use "cookies" to collect information about your visit to our website and to manage information concerning your preferences.
A cookie is a small encrypted computer code added to a file on your computer as a record of your visit.
It does not collect or provide your name or any other personal information about you.
It can, however, be used by this website to note information about your visit, such as your type of web browser, operating system and Internet Protocol address, to better tailor the site for you.
It can also be used to recognize you when you return as a repeat visitor to our website.
We use cookies, for example, to monitor the times when visitors log-on to the website, to track the number of sweepstakes and promotions you enter, to estimate the audience size of the website for sponsors and advertisers, and to track visitor preferences.
Cookies do not allow the website to access Personally Identifiable Information that you have not otherwise provided.
You can control what cookies are accepted by your computer through the settings on your web browser or by deleting them from your computer.
Doing so, however, may limit the personalization available to you.
We, our third party service providers, advertisers or our partners also may use cookies to help deliver, manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Altice or Optimum network of sites or other networks or sites, or to send you customized ads about our own products and services as you access other websites and web services.
This may also help us, our service providers and partners provide more relevant advertising.
For more information regarding third-party ad servers, see "Service providers' and other third parties' collection and use of information" below.
Clear GIFs.
Like many websites, we may use clear GIFs (also known as "web beacons," "Internet tags," or "pixel tags").
Clear GIFs are lines of code that allow websites to summarize overall visitor usage patterns and to provide personalized services.
We may use clear GIFs, for instance, to track visitor preferences or to gather aggregated information about visitor usage patterns.
We do not use clear GIFs to collect any Personally Identifiable Information about visitors.
Passive Automatic Electronic Collection.

For example, we collect your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, the name and location of your Internet Service Provider, the type and version of your browser, the length of time you visit the website, your search queries on the website, and the average number of pages you viewed.
Logging your IP address does not by itself provide us with your name, e-mail address, or home or work address.

For each sweepstakes and special or promotional event, we will post applicable rules for the event on the website.
We may also post on the website any supplemental terms, conditions, or privacy provisions for the specific event.
We use anonymized or aggregated information to improve website services, to gauge the effectiveness of the website, and to improve and enhance visitors' experiences on the website.
In some cases we may combine information collected from subscribers with demographic or other information (such as census records or customer information in our regular business records) for aggregated and anonymized studies or segmentation.
We use such studies to improve, market and promote our services and this website.
We use anonymized profile data to tailor advertising to individual visitors, including those that have visited our own websites.
In addition, we may use Personally Identifiable Information and visitor information for marketing purposes, including to facilitate display ads for our products and services shown to you on other websites and web services across the Internet.
When we do this, we may provide third party service providers with access to certain of your Personally Identifiable Information in order to place de-identified coded data into cookies on your browser (or employ similar technology), and to provide you with more relevant offers and updates through display media.
