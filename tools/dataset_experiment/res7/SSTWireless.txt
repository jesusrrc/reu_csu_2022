You may give us information such as your name, address, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, financial information, employment information, application information, ideas for new projects or applications, and your buying interests.
The purposes for which we collect and use the information that you provide us include to respond to your requests,  to administer, protect, or improve our services or systems, to provide you information or materials in connection with our technologies, products, services, or events, to otherwise communicate or engage with you, or for any other use we may describe when we collect your information.
It is your choice whether or not to provide us with certain information.
However, you may be unable to take advantage of certain offers or features if we do not receive your information.
You may also submit technical information to SST such as designs, ideas or data, that you transmit to or post on the Site (the "Submission") for purposes not limited to contest participation.
The Submission is considered and treated by SST as non-confidential and non-proprietary.
By providing the Submission, you grant SST a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable right to disseminate, display, use, modify, copy, adapt, and translate the Submission for any purpose whatsoever, whether commercial or noncommercial, throughout the world in any media.
You also grant us the right to use the name you submit in connection with your Submission, if we choose.
You represent and warrant in making the Submission that you own or control all rights to the Submission, and that use of your Submission will not cause injury to any person or entity including SST.
You will indemnify SST for all claims resulting from your Submission.
How can I manage the information SST has about me.
You can always choose not to give SST information.
You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time.
You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you.
The laws of some countries or states allow you to request access, correction, deletion, restriction, or other rights with respect to your personal data.
