Other Issues.
(i) What is the legal basis of processing.
Some jurisdictions require an explanation of the legal basis for collecting and processing Personal Data.
We have several different legal grounds on which we collect and process Personal Data, including.
(i) as necessary to perform a transaction (such as when we respond to your requests or register a new product).
(ii) as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as for recordkeeping for consumer protection or tax purposes).
(iii) consent (such as for direct marketing or certain cookies).
and (iv) necessary for legitimate interests (such as when we act to maintain our business generally, including maintaining the safety and security of the Site).
With respect to legitimate interests, we typically collect and process limited Personal Data about partner and distributor contacts and other individuals acting in their business capacities, as part of our overall effort to reduce the privacy impact on individuals.
(ii) What are the consequences of not providing Personal Data.
You are not required to provide all Personal Data identified in this Privacy Policy to use our Site or to interact with us offline, but certain functionality will not be available if you do not provide certain Personal Data.

We do not use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that produces legal effects concerning you or otherwise significantly affects you.
(iv) Does the Site honor do not track ("DNT") signals sent via browsers.
Since there is not a standard in the marketplace, we currently do not respond to DNT signals at this time.
(v) How long do we retain Personal Data.
We typically retain Personal Data related to marketing activities for as long as you accept marketing communications from us, and upon request, we will securely delete such data in accordance with applicable law.
For Personal Data that we collect and process for other purposes, as described above, we typically retain such Personal Data for no longer than the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, and as otherwise needed to address tax, corporate, consumer protection, compliance, litigation, and other legal rights and obligations.
