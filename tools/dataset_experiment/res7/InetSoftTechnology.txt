Google User Data.
This website does not store your Google credentials or any of your user data.
Instead, the  authorization that you grant is passed to your local server installation.
Your local server  will use the provided authorization token to list Google Sheet documents in your Google drive,  read the contents of selected Google Sheets, and query your Google Analytics data as required by  the queries that you define.
Your data will only be stored in your local server installation if  you choose to materialize a visualization that uses data from one of these queries.
