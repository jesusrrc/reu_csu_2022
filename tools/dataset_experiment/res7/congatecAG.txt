Specific information about the website.
Use of a newsletter.
When registering for our newsletter, you provide us with your email address and, on an optional basis, other information.
We use these data solely for the purpose of sending you the newsletter.
We retain the data that you disclose in your newsletter application until you cancel your subscription to our newsletter.
You can unsubscribe at any time via the link in the newsletter intended for this purpose, or by sending us the appropriate notification.
By unsubscribing, you revoke the use of your email address.
We also use your email address, which we receive in connection with the sale of a product or service, exclusively for direct advertising in the form of our newsletter for products or services that we sell that are similar to the ones you ordered, provided that you have not objected to having your email used in this way.
You may object to the use of your email address at any time without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates.
Your objection (and thus the cancellation of our newsletter) can be communicated by sending the appropriate message to our email address (see the Legal Notice).
Marketing Purpose Most information we collect about you comes from our direct interactions with you.
When you register for an event we may collect information (online or offline) in relation to the event organization, and during an event, such as participation in sessions.
We combine the personal information we collect to develop aggregate analysis and business intelligence for conducting our business and for marketing purposes.
You can choose to receive information by email, telephone or postal mail about our products and services, or sign-up for subscriptions.
When visiting our websites or using our services we may provide you with personalized information.

Use of Google Analytics.
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc.
(“Google”).
Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies,” text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of your use of the website.
The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the US and stored there.
However, in the event IP anonymization is activated on this website, your IP address will be shortened beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states to the Treaty on the European Economic Area.
The full IP address will be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there only on an exceptional basis.
Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators, and providing other services to website operators relating to website activity and Internet usage.
Google will not associate the IP address transmitted under Google Analytics by your browser with other data held by Google.
You may prevent the storage of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser software.
however, we should inform you in this case that you might not be able to enjoy all of the functionality of this website to its full extent.
You may additionally prevent the recording of the data (including your IP address) to Google that is generated by the cookie and that pertains to your use of the website, or the processing of these data, by downloading and installing the following browser plug-in available through the following Link .
In view of the discussion about the use of analytics tools with full IP addresses, we would like to point out that this website uses Google Analytics with the extension “_anonymizeIp()” which means that IP addresses are used only in a shortened form in order to prevent any direct correlation to specific persons.
For browsers on mobile devices, please click this link to, in future, prevent anonymous tracking by Google Analytics and to activate a so-called “opt-out cookie” for your browser.
Use of Google Tag Manager.
We use the Google Tag Manager.
Through this service, website tags can be managed via an interface.
The Google Tag Manager only implements tags.
No cookies are set and no personal data is collected.
The Google Tool Manager triggers other tags that may collect data.
The Google Tag Manager does not access this data.
If a deactivation has been made at the domain or cookie level, it remains in place for all tracking tags, insofar as these are implemented with the Google Tag Manager.
More information about the Google Tag Manager can be found at the following link.
.
You have the option to prevent all tags of the Google Tag Manager from being sent.
To do this, you must click on this opt-out link to place the Google Tag Manager deactivation cookie in your browser.
Use of website’s own “cookies”.
This website uses its own “cookies” to increase user-friendliness (“cookies” are text files sent by the web server to the user’s browser and stored there for later retrieval).
Our own “cookies” never store any personal information.
You can prevent the use of “cookies” in general if you set your browser to disallow the storage of “cookies.
”.
You can edit your cookie settings here on your own.
