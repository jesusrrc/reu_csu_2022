This is the privacy policy of CloudRail GmbH (hereinafter referred to as “CloudRail” or “we”), Julius-Hatry-Straße 1, 68163 Mannheim, e-mail.
who is the controller for the data processing pursuant to Art.
4 (7) GDPR.
This privacy policy shall apply to the website of CloudRail and the services offered therein (hereinafter referred to as “Services”).
For a better comprehension of this privacy policy, the most important terms are explained in brief as follows.
Glossary.
What are personal data.
Personal data are data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, e.
g.
relating to you.
This includes, for example, your name, e-mail address, telephone number, postal address, credit card data and the IP address of your device.
What are IP addresses.
IP addresses are combinations of numbers used to identify devices that are connected to the internet.
Each computer or other device connected to the internet is associated with a specific IP address.
What is a cookie.
Cookies are small text files which are set by many websites in your browser on your device.
A cookie generally includes, inter alia, the name of the domain from where the cookie has been set, the “lifetime” of the cookie and a unique number assigned to the cookie.
Cookies may, depending on the function of the individual cookie, also store device-related information on the terminal device, so that the websites recognise the user on its next visit, or store statistical data on the use of the respective websites and services.
Sec.
1 Collecting and processing of personal data when accessing the Services and the use of cookies.
a) When you access our Services, data on this access are collected in so-called “server log files”.
The data collected include.
name of the website or file accessed, date and time of the retrieval, data volume transmitted, browser and operating system you use, the website visited before (so-called “referrer URL”), your IP address, your Internet provider and a confirmation on the successful retrieval of the respective website accessed.
The legal basis for data processing enabling the use of the website is Art.
6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or, if you are already registered for the Services, the legal basis is Art.
6 (1) (b) GDPR.
CloudRail will also make use of the data collected via the server log files for ensuring security and preventing misuse of the Services.
CloudRail reserves the right to subsequently verify these data if, due to precise indications, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting an unlawful use of websites and services.
The legal basis of this processing is Art.
6 (1) (f) GDPR, whereby our legitimate interest is providing the security of our Services.
In addition, CloudRail processes statistical data on the use of the Services to improve the Services and to detect and fix any occurring malfunctions, pursuant to Art.
6 (1) (f) GDPR.
CloudRail’s legitimate interest is to provide user-friendly, fully functioning Services in line with the user’s preferences and interests.
b) The websites of CloudRail use cookies.
Cookies enable CloudRail to recognize your device and, if possible, to make your default settings available immediately, in order to provide user-friendly functions which are not possible without the use of cookies.
The use of cookies is necessary in order to make certain functions of the website (like storing purchase items in your shopping cart) available and also to optimise the website and services of CloudRail continuously.
The data processing in this context is therefore based on Art.
6 (1) (f) GDPR.
CloudRail’s legitimate interest is to provide visitors of its website with a functioning Internet service and to make their visit and use of the website as pleasant and efficient as possible.
You can generally set your browser in such a way that you are informed when cookies are set, that the setting of cookies is excluded for certain cases or generally or that the setting of cookies is only permitted in individual cases.
You can also delete stored cookies in the settings of your browser.
However, if you deactivate cookies, the functionality of CloudRail’s websites may be restricted.
Sec.
2 Use of personal data of registered users.
a) In order to use some of our Services, including parts of our websites, you must first register and create an account.
Within the registration process we collect your contact information (such as name, email address) and the IP address of your device.
The collection of these data is necessary for the provision of the Services and thus for the fulfilment of the contract with you regarding the use of our Services.
Within the use of parts of the Services you may be required to provide additional data.
The data entered for the registration as well as any additional data provided as part of the use of the Services will be used by CloudRail to provide the Services based on the user contract with you, pursuant to Art.
6 (1) (b) GDPR.
This may also include informing you per e-mail on, e.
g.
, changes in the scope of the Services and changes of technical circumstances.
This processing may also include transferring the data to cloud services providers, insofar you set up such a transfer as part of your use of the Services, thereby instructing us to transfer the data accordingly.
b) For processing any of your purchase orders, the above mentioned data as well as the payment information and any additional required information (e.
g.
delivery address) provided by you has to be processed.
For payment processing we use the services of Stripe Inc.
, 185 Berry Street, Suite 550, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (“Stripe”).
For this purpose the aforementioned data is transmitted to servers of Stripe in the United States.

, 340 S.
Lemon Avenue, Suite #1537, Walnut, California 91789, USA (“Chargebee”) for billing and processing payments.

2016/1250) for data transmissions to the United States, according to which companies that meet certain criteria guarantee an adequate level of protection, also known as “EU-US Privacy Shield”.
These companies are included in the so-called Privacy Shield List.
Stripe is one of the companies listed there.
The data transmission to Stripe in connection with handling payments is based on Art.
45 and 28 GDPR.

Hence, the transmission of data to Chargebee in connection with processing payments and billing is based on Art.
45 and 28 GDPR.

Hence, upon registration of the newsletter subscription your IP address and the date of registration will be stored.
Once you have registered, you will receive an e-mail containing a link to activate the newsletter service.
Only after you have activated the newsletter service by clicking the link will your registration be effective and the selected newsletter will be sent to you.
This serves, in particular, evidential purposes in case a third party misuses an e-mail address to register for the newsletter without the authorised person’s knowledge.
Further data are not collected.

“MailChimp”).
For this purpose, your email address and the fact that you have subscribed to our newsletter as well as any other personal data required for the respective newsletter dispatch will be transmitted to MailChimp and stored on the servers of MailChimp in the United States.
MailChimp only uses this information to send and evaluate the newsletter on our behalf.
We strictly adhere to the GDPR including the requirements for IT and data security.
MailChimp also strictly observes these requirements.
MailChimp is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield, which is based on an adequacy decision of the EU Commission, and thus committed to comply with EU data protection regulations.

28 and 45 GDPR.
The legal basis for data processing in connection with the newsletter is your consent pursuant to Art.
6 (1) (a) GDPR.

g.
technical service providers).
Personal data will only be passed on to those service providers with whom we have previously concluded a contract for order processing pursuant to Art.
28 GDPR.
This does not apply to transmissions of data to service providers which are expressly based on a different legal basis in this privacy policy.
If we pass on data to service providers within the scope of our processing, we strictly comply with the requirements of the GDPR, as do our service providers.
Of course, before disclosing your personal data, we ensure that our service providers have taken the necessary technical and organisational measures to ensure an appropriate level of protection.
The scope of the data disclosure is limited to the minimum required for the processing purpose.

In this case, the disclosure of your data is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation to which we are subject, pursuant to Art.
6 (1) (c) GDPR.
Further, CloudRail may disclose data relating to you as user of its Services to third parties, to whom have been assigned CloudRail claims against you, insofar as this is necessary for the assertion of such claims.
Upon request, CloudRail shall provide you with the name of the third party.
Should CloudRail cooperate with third parties for the provision of services, CloudRail will insist on these third parties complying with valid data protection laws and ensuring sufficient data protection.
