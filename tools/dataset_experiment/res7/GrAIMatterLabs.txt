Our Product_.
Lorem ipsum dolor.
The world’s first sparsity-native AI System-on-Chip (SoC) GrAI VIP is optimized for ultra-low latency and low power processing at the endpoint to enable Life-Ready AI.
GrAI VIP drastically reduces application latency, for instance, it can reduce the end-to-end latencies for deep learning networks such as Resnet-50 to the order of a millisecond.
The GrAI VIP edge AI processor is based on GML’s innovative NeuronFlow™ technology that combines the dynamic Dataflow paradigm with sparse computing to produce massively parallel in-network processing.
Our Technology_.
Lorem ipsum dolor.
GrAI Matter Labs utilizes brain-inspired, neural network architecture to overcome the limitations of traditional Von Neumann machines and application processors.
Our unique edge AI processor implementation is the only system that can leverage sparsity from an end-to-end perspective – a fully programmable approach for ease of implementation that offers ultra-low latency while preserving low power levels at high accuracy not feasible before.
