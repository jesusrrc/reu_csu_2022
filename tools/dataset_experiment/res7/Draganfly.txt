Environmental PolicyAt Draganfly we recycle as much of our daily waste as possible.
Our packing for orders is either reused, made from recyclable materials (like our Green Jiffy Bags and paper parcel tape) or compostable (like our starch packing ‘chips’).
We use paper bags for small items where sensible to do so.
We source as much stock from Britain as we can, and the people who do our zinc plating, chroming and powder coating are all in East Anglia.
We also make a lot in house, cutting our carbon footprint in half.
We’re always trying to reduce waste and be more green, why not visit our secondhand section to pick a used bargain and be green yourself.
