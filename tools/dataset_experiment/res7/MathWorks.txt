These principles include.
notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, and recourse, enforcement, and liability.
GDPR and global privacy laws.
If you are subject to the GDPR or other applicable privacy laws, you have the right to make certain requests about your personal data.

Privacy Shield and privacy inquiries.
The US Department of Commerce continues to administer the Privacy Shield program, including processing submissions for self-certification and re-certification to the Privacy Shield Frameworks and maintaining the Privacy Shield List.
MathWorks remains certified, but no longer relies on Privacy Shield as a legal basis for transfers of data under GDPR.
Instead, MathWorks uses measures approved by the European Data Protection Board for any such transfers.
MathWorks is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, visit  MathWorks remains liable in cases of onward transfer to third parties in accordance with Privacy Shield and applicable privacy laws.
MathWorks is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
In compliance with privacy laws and the Privacy Shield Frameworks, MathWorks commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.

Notification of material changes to this Privacy Policy will be provided by noting a new "updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
Part Two.
Privacy in Specific MathWorks Products and Services.
1.
MathWorks Account.
Most MathWorks products and services are accessed using your MathWorks Account.
Your name, email address, country, and the reason for your use of MathWorks products and services are required to create a MathWorks Account.
This information is provided by either you or your organization at the time the account is created.
We do not allow children under 13 to create a MathWorks Account.
Accounts for children must be created by an authorized adult who can consent on the child’s behalf.
You have the option of using Two-Step Verification for your MathWorks Account.
This option can be enabled or disabled from the Security Settings page when you are signed in to your MathWorks Account.
If you enable Two-Step Verification, you will provide an email address or phone number where we can send you verification codes.
We will only use this information for the purpose of sending you verification messages.
MathWorks uses a third-party communications provider to send the text messages used for Two-Step Verification.
We have a contract that requires the communications provider to keep your phone number confidential, only use it for the purpose of sending verification codes, and only retain it as required by law.
You may also be able to receive verification codes via a third-party app that you choose to install on your mobile device.
When you are signed in to your MathWorks Account, MathWorks can link your login and usage with licenses and subscriptions to MathWorks products and services to which you have access.
2.
Web site and online services.
When you visit the MathWorks web site and otherwise use our online services, we collect usage, device, and network information such as your IP address, the type of operating system and web browser you are using, and which areas you visit.
We may use data collected in web server log files, JavaScript code, and cookies (as further described below).
We use this information for purposes such as administering our web site, helping to diagnose problems with our technology infrastructure, providing visitors with relevant content, and analyzing visitors’ behavior to better understand their needs.
The MathWorks web site also has several forms and additional collection methods that request contact, payment, and other information.
Providing this information is optional, but you may be unable to complete certain transactions, obtain certain services, or access certain features of the MathWorks web site or software without providing the requested information.
When you voluntarily submit information to us through a form on our web site and that information is not part of a legal or business transaction (for example, if you download a white paper or send us feedback), you consent to the storage and use of your information for the purpose for which it was submitted and your information may also be used for sales and marketing purposes unless you opt out.
3.
Cookies.
When you visit the MathWorks web site or otherwise use our online services, one or more cookies are placed on (or read from) your machine if your browser is set to accept cookies.
A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser.
A cookie consists of a simple code that is used to access your account information, maintain current session data, gather broad demographic information, and help analyze web site traffic.
MathWorks may use the information in cookies for a variety of purposes including, but not limited to, market research and improving the content of our web site.
Cookies may also be accessible to third parties for the web analytics, social media, and advertising purposes described below.
Some cookies are used for internal purposes, such as keeping you signed in to your MathWorks Account or telling us which pages you have visited.
Other cookies are shared with third parties.
see the web analytics, social media, and third-party advertising section below for an explanation of how these are used.
MathWorks also sets cookies that look at your preferences when you use the web site so that MathWorks may offer you tailored marketing information that you may be interested in.
Although web browsers typically allow cookies by default, you may choose not to receive cookies by modifying the settings of your web browser to disable cookies.
Where required, you may opt out of cookies that are not essential to provide the web site or online service.
You can also set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.
If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of the MathWorks web site and online services.
4.
Web analytics, social media, and third-party advertising.
MathWorks engages a third-party web traffic analysis company to log aggregate information coming through our web site on our behalf.
MathWorks controls how that data may and may not be used.
When you visit our web site, the third-party web traffic analysis company may use technical tracking methods such as cookies (which may be listed under the domains mathworks.
com, mathworks.
demdex.
net, or 2o7.
net), and web beacons, on our behalf, and may receive information about your browsing on our web site.
We may also use these technical tracking methods in emails to determine whether the recipients have opened such emails, clicked on links contained in those emails, and continued to browse our web site.
We direct the third-party web traffic analysis company to collect information that is unique to individual visitors.
The information collected is not personally identifiable to the third-party web traffic analysis company.
We do not share any personally identifiable information, such as your name, mailing address, or email address, with the third-party web traffic analysis company.
MathWorks may work with select third-party partners who use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to provide measurement services and serve you MathWorks related content, including MathWorks advertisements, on their web sites or elsewhere on the Internet, based on your prior visits to our web site.
We allow third-party companies, including social media web sites, to collect certain anonymous information when you share or bookmark content from our web site.
We do not share any personally identifiable information with these third-party companies.
However, if these companies already have information about you or have also stored cookies on your computer, they may be able to match the non-identifiable information with their existing information to identify you.
If you wish to opt-out of behavioral advertising on third-party web sites, visit the Network Advertising Initiative web site or Digital Advertising Alliance web site.
5.
Do Not Track.
Like most other companies, our web site and online services are not consistently configured to respond to browsers' "Do Not Track" signals because at this time no formal "Do Not Track" standard has been adopted.
6.
Customer service and technical support.
Support calls may be recorded and used for internal training and auditing purposes.
We inform callers if their call is being recorded or monitored, and obtain consent as required by law.
Recordings are deleted periodically according to company policy.
Other communications related to support, such as email and form submissions, are retained in MathWorks systems for purposes of tracking support issues and improving our products.
7.
MathWorks Store.
MathWorks Store has security measures in place to protect the order information under our control against loss, misuse, destruction, and alteration.
We use industry-standard security measures called TLS encryption.
Encryption helps protect your credit card number and personal information by scrambling the data in transit to the MathWorks Store.
We encrypt every order.
MathWorks does not store your full credit card number, but stores information about the payment and transaction including an order number, obfuscated credit card number (with XXXX substituted for some digits), and expiration date.
MathWorks uses a PCI-compliant third-party vendor to securely process your order.
When you submit an order through the MathWorks Store, you are submitting your payment information directly to the third-party vendor, which then may pass your information to financial intermediaries such as banks.
8.
Product installation, licensing, and usage.
The information we collect in connection with product installation, licensing, and usage allows us to understand your requirements, to ensure effective licensing of our products, and to provide you with information that you may need for support in the future.
To enable you to use our products, we may request or collect information such as your name, email address, physical location, phone number, title, company name, and/or system user name.
Such information may be used to activate, register, confirm, or update your product or license.
Most MathWorks products and services contain technology for license management and for the prevention of unlicensed use.
Most MathWorks products and services also contain technology that sends user experience information to MathWorks both in the course of normal usage and in the event of a software crash.
This technology causes the products and services to send messages to MathWorks over the Internet that contain network, device, license, and usage information.
At the time of installation or activation, MathWorks software may collect network and device information including your MAC address, IP address, computer hostname and username, and operating system version.
On an ongoing basis, when you use MathWorks products and services, MathWorks software may periodically collect network, device, account, license, and usage information, including which license you are linked with and which products and features you are using.
License administrators may set up accounts for licensed users and view information about use by licensed users such as which products the users have access to and whether the products have been activated.
User experience information transmitted may include the products, features, and services you accessed, the length of your session, errors that occurred, your IP address, a license identifier, and your email address if you choose to submit it when sending an error report.
Desktop users can opt out of sending user experience information during installation or in MATLAB preferences.
MathWorks has technical and organizational restrictions in place that limit access to your product usage information.
MathWorks does not share this information with third parties except for web and systems infrastructure vendors with whom we have a contract.
9.
MATLAB Online, Simulink Online, MATLAB Drive, MATLAB Mobile, MATLAB Drive Connector, and Cloud Center.
Most MathWorks online services require you to sign in with your MathWorks Account.
In addition to information that we normally collect for our web site and online products and services, if you have chosen to integrate our services with a third-party service, MathWorks may store authentication information for the third-party service.
When you store files using our online services, your files are stored with a third-party web and systems infrastructure vendor with whom MathWorks has a contract.
If you are working offline, your files are stored on your own device until you are back online.
If you store files using our online services, they can only be accessed by you unless you choose to share them.
Even if you have an account through an organization, like a company or university, others in your organization can only see your files if you choose to share them.
Select MathWorks personnel serving in certain information technology roles have access limited to deployment, backup, and recovery operations.
These personnel all have signed confidentiality agreements.
10.
Add-On Explorer and File Exchange.
Add-On Explorer requires you to sign in with your MathWorks Account.
File Exchange requires you to sign in with your MathWorks Account if you are contributing or downloading files.
When you download files using Add-On Explorer or File Exchange, MathWorks stores your IP address.
In addition, if you have contributed content from GitHub to Add-On Explorer or File Exchange, MathWorks stores your GitHub account information.
11.
ThingSpeak™.
ThingSpeak requires you to sign in with your MathWorks Account.
MathWorks stores any information that you provide for integration between ThingSpeak and MathWorks or third-party services, such as authentication credentials and code files.
MathWorks also stores data that you choose to send to ThingSpeak.
You can choose to make that data public or private.
Public data is generally displayed with your MathWorks Account login and a link to your MathWorks Account profile.
Access to your private data and apps is protected by API keys that you may reset at any time.
12.
Authentication system for educational institutions.
For students and personnel at educational institutions that elect to use a federated identity management system, such as Shibboleth, the institution directs the user to a portal where the user signs in.
After sign-in, MathWorks receives information from the institution including the user’s identifier and organizational affiliation.
If provided by the institution, MathWorks also receives the user’s name and email address.
The user then sets up his or her own MathWorks Account, which is prepopulated with this information.
13.
MATLAB Grader.
MATLAB Grader may require you to sign in with your MathWorks Account.
Where MATLAB Grader is accessed in conjunction with an educational institution’s learning management system, MathWorks receives only anonymized user IDs through MATLAB Grader that MathWorks cannot associate to any individual.
When MATLAB Grader is used in this manner, MathWorks does not store, process, or transmit personally identifiable information or confidential data in connection with MATLAB Grader.
Your organization or account administrator may access assignments you have completed and your progress on the assignments.
14.
Online Training Courses.
Online Training Courses may require you to sign in with your MathWorks Account.
Your organization may have a license that provides you with access to Online Training Suite, a collection of Online Training Courses.
in such case, your organization or account administrator may access information about your usage, including training you have completed and your progress on the training.
MathWorks is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of your organization, which may differ from those set forth in this Privacy Policy.
If your organization is administering your use of MathWorks products and services, please direct your privacy inquiries to your organization or administrator.
15.
MOOCs, online textbooks, learning management systems, and other online learning environments.
When you access and use MathWorks products or services through an online learning platform, such as a MOOC, online textbook, or learning management system hosted by your institution, MathWorks does not collect personal information about you unless it is sent by the institution hosting the learning management system.
The educational institution controls the information sent by the learning management system.
If an instructor provides scoring criteria and chooses to have the MathWorks learning environment score a student’s assignment, MathWorks calculates the score and sends it to the institution’s learning management system, but does not store the student’s score.
Instructors have access to information that does not identify students, such as the number of people who completed assignments, the number of attempts students made, and submitted solutions.
Students may voluntarily identify their assignment submissions to instructors.
in this case, instructors would be able to match a student with the student’s submissions.
16.
Products and services purchased through authorized resellers and distributors.
We share information with our authorized resellers and distributors to the extent required for them to perform their duties.
We also receive information from our authorized resellers and distributors when you contact them regarding our products and services, or purchase our products or services from them.
The information shared includes your contact information, organization information, license information, and the products and services in which you have expressed an interest.
17.
In-person and online events.
If you register for, attend, or express interest in one of our in-person or online events, such as a conference or webinar, we collect your contact information and information about your organization, role, and interests related to our products and services.
We may either receive this information from, or share this information with, third parties who are jointly managing or who are assisting us in managing the event.
For example, these third parties may include event organizers or co-sponsors, vendors who are managing event registration, online webinar providers, or app providers who allow you to download an app for event scheduling or attendance.

MathWorks supports student competitions, both by itself and in collaboration with other organizations.
When you participate in a competition, MathWorks collects your contact information, the name of your educational institution, and information about your interest or expertise in MathWorks products and services.
MathWorks may receive this information either directly from you, from a team leader on your behalf, or from an organization holding or supporting the competition.
MathWorks may share this information with an organization holding or supporting the competition.
