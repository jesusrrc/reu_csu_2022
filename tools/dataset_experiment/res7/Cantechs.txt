Privacy Policy.
All management and staff at Can-Tech Services respect your privacy.
We are committed to protecting your personal information in regard to our services to you and in all our business operations.
Your personal information includes your resume, contact details or any references you have provided.
The personal information we collect from you allows Can-Tech to provide the best possible service throughout the job search process.
In addition to your resume, contact details, and references we may also keep the following information in your file.
Interview notes.
Information obtained through reference and background checks.
Educational records.
Reference letters.
Banking details with regard to payroll services.
Benefits package requirements (i.
e.
beneficiary information).
The information we have in your file will help us to understand your needs and wants, and allow us to find you the right job.
We will also use the information in our discussions with potential employers and for payroll arrangements.
Your personal information will never be traded, sold or leased by us to any external companies.
Any disclosure of your personal information is only for Can-Tech’s legitimate business purposes or as required to meet legal and regulatory requirements.
You will rely on us to share your information with potential employers when a relevant job opening is available.
We may also share limited information about you with Can-Tech representatives for the purpose of providing you with the best available staffing services.
Every contract we enter into with a representative clearly outlines the representative’s obligation to protect your personal information and live up to the principles of privacy.
For example, we may share your limited personal information with organizations that perform background checks including criminal, educational and credit checks as required by a potential employer.
Information Security.
Can-Tech staff procedures and policies are in place to ensure that your personal information (both paper and electronic format) is secure.
Some of the measures we take in securing your information are.
ensuring that filing cabinets containing personal information remain locked after hours, limiting access to your files on a need-to-know basis depending on job function, training staff as to the importance of privacy and security, shredding paper records of your personal information when disposal is required, and ensuring that the computer databases containing your personal information are well-protected with the most up-to-date firewall technology.
Note that Can-Tech has no control over the inherent risks of interception using unencrypted emails when sharing information with clients via e-mail.
In using the services offered by Can-Tech, you are aware of such risks and understand that Can-Tech takes no responsibility and accepts no liability for any such interception.
Your Consent.
Having read this policy and by using our services and providing us with your personal information, we imply your consent to the collection, use, disclosure and sharing of your personal information as specified herein.
For example, if you provide us with contact details for your previous employers, we will imply your consent to Can-Tech contacting them in order to check your references.
Otherwise, Can-Tech will obtain your express consent if we determine that the reasons for disclosing your information are not obvious to you.
Information on File.
Your information will remain on file with Can-Tech for as long as you are referable for employment, or longer if required by law.
If you request that Can-Tech destroy your file, we will do so, subject to legislative restrictions.
For example, for temporary work, we must retain your payroll information for seven years after you are taken off our payroll, in accordance with tax regulations.
Can-Tech retains and destroys personal information in accordance with internal record retention procedures that are compliant with applicable laws.
