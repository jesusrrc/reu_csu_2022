SECURITY.
We are committed to keeping personal data secure, and we have implemented contractual, technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against its unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.
Such measures have been implemented taking into account the state of the art of the technology, their cost of implementation, the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the personal data.
When we provide your personal data to third parties, including service providers, we require those companies to protect the personal data they receive and not to use the personal data for any purpose other than providing the required services.
Nevertheless, although we have tried to make our products and services secure and reliable, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from us cannot be guaranteed.
We therefore urge you to exercise caution when conveying any personal data over the Internet.
As when disclosing any information on the Internet, you should remain mindful that such information might be accessible by the public and, consequently, may be collected and used by others without your consent.
You should also recognize that your use of the Internet and any other means of communication with us is solely at your own risk.

We encourage you to be aware of when you leave this website, and to read the privacy policies of any other websites that you may visit.
Some web browsers transmit “do-not-track” signals to websites.
Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.
We currently do not take action in response to these signals.
HOW LONG DO WE STORE YOUR DATA.
Personal data is maintained on our servers or those of our service providers and is accessible by authorized employees, representatives, agents, and service providers who require access for the purposes described herein.
We will retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected or to comply with legal, regulatory or internal policy requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
OUR POLICY TOWARD MINORS.
Our website, products and services are not directed to minors under 16 and we do not knowingly collect personal data from minors.
If we learn that we have collected personal data of a minor under 16 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.
