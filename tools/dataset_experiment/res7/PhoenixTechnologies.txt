Phoenix Privacy Policy.
Phoenix Technologies Ltd.
(“Phoenix,” “we,” “us“) is concerned about online privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose your Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below).
This Privacy Policy (the “Policy“) describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through our web site (the “Site“).
This Policy does not address our practices regarding information that we collect by any means other than online collection through the Site.
By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy.
If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy, please do not use the Site.
We reserve the right to change this Policy without prior notice.
You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the bottom of this Policy.
Any changes to our Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Policy on the Site.
Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy then in effect.
1.
What Types of Information Does Phoenix Collect Through the Site.
Phoenix gathers three basic types of information through the Site.
“Personally Identifiable Information” (or “PII”), “Non-Personally Identifiable Information” (or “Non-PII”) and “IP Addresses”.
Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as an individual, including information that permits us to contact you, online.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity or contact information.
An IP Address is the Internet Protocol address of the computer that you are using.
a.
Personally Identifiable Information.
You do not have to provide PII to use the Site.
However, in order to send you company information, including product information, we may require that you furnish PII.
We collect PII from you through the Site, such as your name, company, telephone number and e-mail address, only when you voluntarily provide it to us.
b.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
When you visit and interact with the Site, Phoenix and third parties with whom Phoenix has contracted to provide services to Phoenix may collect Non-PII.
Non-PII is generally collected through the Site from two different sources.
environmental variables and other similar technologies and information that you voluntarily provide.
i.
Environmental Variables.
We and our service providers may also collect certain environmental variables, such as your computer type (Windows or Macintosh), OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version.
These environmental variables are collected by most web servers, and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.
ii.
Cookies.
We do not use “cookies” on the Site.
Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual’s computer for recordkeeping purposes.
iii.
Online Tracking.
Online tracking is the online collection of personal information about you as you leave our Site and move across web sites and online services.
We do not track you online.
iv.
Information That You Voluntarily Provide.
Phoenix may also collect Non-PII (e.
g.
, your title or your employer) when you voluntarily provide such information to us.
When such information is not combined with any PII, such information is considered to be Non-PII, as it does not personally identify you or any other user or your physical or online location.
Additionally, we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of users who live in a particular region.
Such aggregate information is considered Non-PII for purposes of this Policy.
c.
IP Addresses.
When you visit and interact with the Site, Phoenix may collect IP Addresses.
Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited.
2.
How Does Phoenix Use Information Collected From Me.
a.
Personally Identifiable Information.
We may use PII about you in the following ways.
i.
Fulfillment of Requests.
Phoenix may use PII about you to fulfill the purpose for which such PII was provided (e.
g.
, to send company or product information to you).
We also may use PII to provide you with information, to improve our products, performance of our websites and the overall visitor experience and to help us better understand your needs and interests.
ii.
Administrative Communications.
From time to time, in our sole discretion, we may use PII about you to send to you important information regarding the Site, changes to our terms, conditions, and policies or other administrative information.
Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications.
While we reserve the right to send you updates to this policy, we may update this privacy policy without sending you an email update.
Please check with this privacy policy from time to time to be sure you have the most current version.
iii.
Other Communications.
From time to time, we may use PII about you to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you.

iv.
Internal Business Purposes.
We may also use PII about you for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits and so forth.
b.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

In addition, we reserve the right to share such Non PII, which does not personally identify you, with third parties, for any purpose.
In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII (such as embedding e-mail addresses in cookies).
If we do combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII hereunder as long as it is so combined (see Section 2(a) above).
c.
IP Addresses.
Our Site automatically collects your IP address and the IP addresses of all users, solely for purposes of Site maintenance, such as calculating Site usage levels and helping diagnose server problems.
We do not use IP Addresses for any other purpose.
Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.
Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files and related information as Non-PII, unless we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.
3.
How Long is Personally Identifiable Information Maintained.
When you provide us PII, we will use it to fulfill your request, such as a request for product information and may continue to store it as part of our communications with you about our products, to provide customer support, back up our systems and allow for disaster recovery.
We may retain information about you for legitimate business purposes, including the purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law and we may decline to process requests that are impractical.
