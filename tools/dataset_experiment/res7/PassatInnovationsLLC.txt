The download of the ZIP file with the documents does not take place directly but requires the entry of an email address.
The system then automatically sends a download link to the specified email address.
The email address and the contents of the shopping cart are used for the purpose of providing this service (Art.
6 para.
1 p.
1 lit.
b DSGVO) and automatically deleted after 7 days.
The user data can be viewed by the order processor and IT service provider makandra GmbH, Augsburg, for the purpose of system maintenance and monitoring.

IV.
Video streaming.
You can access livestreams and video-on-demand services via the Volkswagen Newsroom on a voluntary basis.
This moving image content is for your information.
When you call up the livestream or the video-on-demand, your IP address is processed for the purpose of providing the video retrieval.
The legal basis for the data processing is the fulfillment of the contract Art.
6 para.
1 lit.
b DSGVO.
The processing of personal data takes place exclusively in the form of your IP address, which is required for dowloading and livestreaming video content.
Volkswagen AG uses your IP address to evaluate access to video content anonymously.
For this purpose, the full IP address is forwarded to a web analysis server, where it is made anonymous immediately after the transfer.
The web analysis server then processes the anonymous IP address, in order to statistically analyse the accesses.
The anonymous IP address cannot be linked to a person.
The anonymisation of your IP address for the statistical analysis of accesses to video content, and for the purpose of optimising the range of videos, represents a further processing of your IP address, which is compatible with the original purpose for which the information was collected.
The anonymisation of your IP address for the purpose of statistically analysing the accesses takes place on the legal basis of our legitimate interest (Art.
6 para.
1 lit.
f DSGVO).
The legitimate interest of Volkswagen AG is to analyse the media usage of website users, in order to optimise and further develop video content in line with the requirements of website users.
The technical platform for streaming the videos and their statistical analysis is provided by the IT service provider makandra GmbH, Augsburg, and ComSat Media GmbH, Heusenstamm.
The personal data in the form of your IP address is automatically deleted after 30 days.
Corresponding order processing contracts have been concluded.
C.
Use of cookies and tracking tools.
I.
General information.
Volkswagen AG uses various cookies on its websites.
Cookies are small files with configuration information that are stored on your terminal device and are automatically included in case of inquiries to our server.
Cookies can basically be divided into three categories.
There are cookies that are essential for the functionality of the website (so-called function cookies), cookies that increase the comfort of a website visit and, for example, save your language settings (so-called comfort cookies) and cookies based on which a pseudonymized usage profile is created (so-called tracking cookies).
The processing of the function cookies is necessary to enable you to visit the website (cf.
Art.
6 para.
1 lit.
b DSGVO).
Tracking Cookies are only set if the website visitor has given their consent (Art.
6 Para.
1 lit.
a GDPR).
Consent is given via the so-called cookie banner, which must be actively clicked on.
You can object to data processing described above by using the listed cookies and tracking tools at any time with effect for the future by changing your cookie settings in your browser or clicking on the following link and changing your currently set preferences in our Cookie Consent Manager.
Manage my preferences.
For more information about our cookies, please refer to the Cookie Policy and the following.
II.
Matomo.
This website uses the software of the web analytics provider Matomo to evaluate user access to the Volkswagen Newsroom.
The data processing is carried out based on your consent (Art.
6 Para.
1 lit.
a GDPR).
Therefore tracking cookies are stored on your terminal device and are forwarded to a server with the Matomo web analysis software.
The server is operated by the IT service provider makandra GmbH, Augsburg, on behalf of Volkswagen AG.
On the server with the web analysis software, your IP address is anonymized immediately after transmission.
For this purpose, your IP address is shortened by the last 16 bits or 2 octets when using Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) or by 80 bits or 10 octets when using Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6).
The anonymized IP address is thus not personally identifiable.
The web analysis software then processes the anonymized IP address for statistical evaluation of accesses.
The anonymized data is processed to aggregated reports by the Matomo web analysis software and the individual data is automatically deleted after 180 days by the IT service provider makandra GmbH, Augsburg.
D.
Social Media.
Volkswagen AG does not use so-called social media plug-ins for the display of texts from social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or YouTube on this website, so that no personal data is initially passed on to the social media providers when the Volkswagen Newsroom is called up.
By clicking on the content of social media providers on our website, a notice appears.
Your attention is drawn to the fact that you will either leave the website and switch to the page of a third-party provider or that the selected content of the social media provider will be displayed to you on this website.
Only by confirming the notice you give your consent to the data processing (Art.
6 para.
1 lit.
a DSGVO) and get to the web pages or the content of the social media provider.
To play the videos via YouTube, for example, the JavaScript of the provider is loaded.
The provider receives the information that you have accessed the video or image via our website.
This occurs regardless of whether you have set up a user account with the respective social network and are logged in there.
If you are logged into the social network, the provider can assign this data directly to your user account.
It is possible that the respective social media providers use the data to create user profiles.
Volkswagen AG has no influence on the data collected by the provider and its further processing.
The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by the providers, as well as your rights in this regard and setting options for protecting your privacy, can be found in the privacy statements of the respective provider.
E.

The Volkswagen Newsroom is an open platform and offers comprehensive search options to all users.
If you would like to be kept informed about our press releases and stories you can also subscribe to our media information and e-mail newsletters.
The specified fuel consumption and emission data have been determined according to the measurement procedures prescribed by law.
Since 1st September 2017, certain new vehicles are already being type-approved according to the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), a more realistic test procedure for measuring fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
Starting on September 1st 2018, the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) will be replaced by the WLTP in stages.
Owing to the more realistic test conditions, the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions measured according to the WLTP will, in many cases, be higher than those measured according to the NEDC.
For further information on the differences between the WLTP and NEDC, please visit .
We are currently still required by law to state the NEDC figures.
In the case of new vehicles which have been type-approved according to the WLTP, the NEDC figures are derived from the WLTP data.
It is possible to specify the WLTP figures voluntarily in addition until such time as this is required by law.
In cases where the NEDC figures are specified as value ranges, these do not refer to a particular individual vehicle and do not constitute part of the sales offering.
They are intended exclusively as a means of comparison between different vehicle types.
Additional equipment and accessories (e.
g.
add-on parts, different tyre formats, etc.
) may change the relevant vehicle parameters, such as weight, rolling resistance and aerodynamics, and, in conjunction with weather and traffic conditions and individual driving style, may affect fuel consumption, electrical power consumption, CO2 emissions and the performance figures for the vehicle.
Further information on official fuel consumption figures and the official specific CO2 emissions of new passenger cars can be found in the “Guide on the fuel economy, CO2 emissions and power consumption of new passenger car models”, which is available free of charge at all sales dealerships and from DAT Deutsche Automobil Treuhand GmbH, Hellmuth-Hirth-Str.
