1.
What information do we collect from you.
In order to better provide you with services, we collect two types of information about its visitors.
Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.
Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth and efficient experience while using our Offerings.
Personal Information.
Personal Information refers to the specifics of who you are, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address and any other information needed to provide a service to you while using our Offerings.
We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.
g.
, HTML pages, graphics, etc.
), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.
We may combine this automatically collected information with other information we collect about you to improve services, marketing, analytics, or site functionality.
When you download and use our Mobile Apps, we automatically collect information regarding your device system and performance information, such as operating system version, operation system type, hardware usage statistics, and app version.
This information is collected to assist us in providing, maintaining and optimizing the services that we are providing to you.
We may also access the device file storage for photos, microphone, camera, and contacts.
This allows us to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results.
You can opt out of this at the device level.
TIBCO collects Personal Information when you register with TIBCO for a TIBCO account as a customer, potential customer, or guest user, when you use certain TIBCO products or services, when you register to attend a seminar or participate in an online forum, blog, or a voluntary survey, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list (see "Choice/Opt-Out" below), when you submit an entry for promotions, or when you submit your Personal Information to TIBCO for any other reason.
We use the Personal Information that we collect to send you information that you have requested, respond to an inquiry, or to facilitate the features in our Offerings as described in this Policy.
TIBCO may also process your Personal Information to track and analyze your usage of TIBCO products and services to the extent it is necessary for our legitimate interest in developing and improving our products and services.
From time to time, TIBCO receives Personal Information from business partners and vendors.
TIBCO only uses such information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy.
When using our Mobile Apps, we will provide you the option to add your location in conjunction with some features of the Mobile App such as adding your location to a post.
We ask you to opt into providing us with your geo-location data each time you provide it.
If you no longer wish to allow us to track your geo-location information in the Mobile App, you may turn this off at the device level.
Services.
TIBCO collects information on behalf of our Clients and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it possesses.
The use of this data will be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which our Clients have engaged TIBCO.
If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by them, please contact the Client that you interact with directly.
We may transfer Personal Information to companies that help us provide our services.
Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients.
We acknowledge that you have the right to access your personal information.
If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would like to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, direct your inquiry to our Client (the data controller).
If the Client requests TIBCO to remove the data, we will respond to that request in 30 days.
TIBCO will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Clients.
TIBCO will also retain this Personal Information as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Legal bases for Processing.
Our legal basis for collecting, using and processing the Personal Information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect and use it.
Where required by law, we obtain your consent to use and process your Personal Information.
Otherwise, we rely on another authorized legal basis (including but not limited to the (a) performance of a contract, (b) legitimate interest or (c) compliance with legal obligations) to collect and process your Personal Information.
For instance, we process your Personal Information to the extent it is necessary to perform our contractual obligations towards you or to take pre-contractual steps at your request, such as for the use of our websites and to fulfill our obligations under the applicable terms of use/service, and to provide you with content you access and request (e.
g.

What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information.
We employ industry-recognized information technology to protect the security of the information you submit to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
The importance of security for all Personal Information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us.
Our secure servers protect this information using password protection and advanced encryption, and we may use firewall technology for additional protection.
When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number, login information for our Services, or Geo-Location information) on our Offerings, we encrypt the transmission of that information using transport layer security (TLS).
Furthermore, all of the user data we collect is protected against unauthorized access by physical security means.
We also encourage our partners and service providers to adopt and follow stringent consumer privacy policies.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about security on our Offerings, you can contact us at .
