Privacy Policy.
Here’s our Privacy Policy.
It is important because it explains what data we collect and how we use that data.
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at .
Last updated on January 27, 2021.
When you install our Chirp Device in your home or other residential property, it collects data that allows you to monitor a care recipient for variables such as activity level and occupancy by room without intrusive cameras.
That data is uploaded wirelessly to our Chirp Mobile App that you have downloaded on your mobile device.
In addition, when you interact with the Chirp Mobile App, purchase a Chirp Device or register as a customer – or when you browse our Websites – certain information about you is collected.
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to help you understand what data and information we collect and how we use it, so please take a moment to review it.
Privacy is an important matter in the digital age – and it has become increasingly complicated to understand who collects information about you and how it is used.
First you need to understand what this Privacy Policy relates to.
When we use the terms “we”, “our”, or “us” in this Privacy Policy, we mean our company called Chirp Inc.
and its subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide.
This Privacy Policy applies to our Chirp device (“Chirp Device”), our website located at mychirp.
com and any other website we may establish in the future (individually a “Website” and collectively “Websites”), the Chirp mobile application developed by us and any other app we may develop in the future (each, a “Chirp Mobile App” and collectively the “Chirp Mobile Apps”), and also any other software, cloud service, add-on service or feature developed by us and available as part of the Service whether now existing or incorporated in the future.
The Chirp Devices, Websites, Chirp Mobile Apps, and any other software, cloud service and feature referred to in the previous sentence are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “Services.
”.
By using any of the Services, you accept that we may use the data and information we collect from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
What data do we collect.
Personal Data.
Personal Data is information that identifies a particular individual (“Personal Data”).
In order for us to provide the Services to you, we need to collect and use certain Personal Data about you.
We may collect the following Personal Data when you order a Chirp Device, interact with our customer service, add another authorized user for your Chirp Device, or otherwise use any of the Services.
• Your and the other authorized users’ first and last names.
• Your and the other authorized users’ e-mail address, telephone number, address and other contact information.
When you pay for your Chirp Device(s) and for any other fees related to your use of the Chirp Device (such as subscription fees) on our Website or from one of our third party vendors, you will need to provide your credit card or other applicable payment method.
We do not collect this information because we use third parties to process payments for Chirp Devices.
When making a payment, you should refer to the Privacy Policy of our payment processors.
We currently use stripe.
com, PayPal and Shopify to process payments and may add additional payment processors in the future.
Third party vendors may use other payment processors.
Sensor Data.
Sensor Data is information that a Chirp Device detects and gathers from your home, such as the level of noise and occupancy data.
Your Chirp Device does not record conversations.
Special Note About Children.
Our Services are not directed or suitable for children under the age of 18.
We do not knowingly collect any Personal Data from children under 18 without parental consent.
If you are aware of a user under the age of 18 using the Services without parental consent, please contact us immediately.
We reserve the right to delete or deny access to any account or authorized user immediately if we suspect the account holder or authorized user is a child under the age of 18 whether the child is using the Services with or without parental consent.
Please note that if you add your child under the age of 18 as an authorized user of your Chirp Device and the Chirp Service, you will be deemed to have given your parental consent to the inclusion of your child’s Personal Data in the Services.
If you add someone else’s child (such as a relative staying with you) as an authorized user of your Chirp Device and Chirp Service, you must get that child’s parental consent.
Please also read the Section titled “What else should I know about security and the Chirp Service.
” below.
Important note about data you disclose to third parties in connection with using the Services.
You may choose to provide data and information about yourself and your use of the Services to third parties, such as to.
• Websites, Features, Apps or Services Developed by Third Parties.
To increase your enjoyment of the Services, we may provide links or references to third party developed websites, features, apps or services on our website, blogs, discussion forums, social media accounts or otherwise.
For example, we encourage, and have an active group of users that provide, community developed features based on various open source software.
You may also independently find third party developed interfaces between the Services and the third party app or service.
These third party apps or features or services might include, for example, applets.
These allow you to get more from your Chirp Device, such as getting an e-mail or text message alert, or turning lights on or off in your home, based on Sensor Data detected by your Chirp Device.
If you decide to access these third party websites, features, apps or services, you do so at your own risk.
We suggest that before (1) using any third party websites, features, apps or services, (2) choosing to disclose your Personal Data to them, and (3) allowing them to access your Sensor Data, that you read their Terms of Service and privacy policies to understand what information they collect about you and how they use that information.

We or others may store, display, reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format and may or may not attribute it to you.
Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties.
Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Data, in connection with your User Content.
Please note that we do not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such information will respect your privacy or keep it secure.
We are not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that you make publicly available on social media, online blogs or public forums – or what others do with information you share.
What else should I know about security and the Services.
Please note that it is your responsibility to determine what action you will take as a result of the Sensor Data detected from your home or any alerts that Chirp Device sends to your Chirp Mobile App, as applicable.
Our Chirp Device is not able to determine the cause of any variations in the Sensor Data detected and will not, for example, alert emergency services or the authorities as a result of any data measured or alarm.
You should be mindful of the security of your computer or mobile device, and prevent unauthorized third parties from opening your Chirp Mobile App.
We recommend you protect your mobile device with a passcode and change your Chirp Mobile App’s log-in password periodically.

You are responsible for obtaining your own wi-fi and Internet connection to use your Chirp Device and our Services.
You should understand that your mobile phone, computer and other electronic devices are susceptible to attack from third parties.
We recommend you use firewalls, store your passwords in a safe place, and create passwords for yourself that are strong.
The security of your Internet connection and/or wi-fi network is your responsibility and out of our control.
