We ensure that Sinch is compliant with local data protection laws of the countries where we are established and other applicable data protection laws that may be applicable on your personal data because of where you live.
So why are we informing you.
To enable us to fulfil our legal and contractual obligations, to conduct business securely and efficiently and for other specific purposes that are described in this notice, we need to process certain personal information about you (referred to as “personal data”).
Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual.
Different pieces of information, which when collected together or combined with other information can lead to the identification of a particular person, is also personal data.
Sinch as a Controller.
Sinch is what is known as the “controller”.

For more information on which personal data we are processing, please read “Next questions.
Who provides us with personal data, which information will we have and what will we use the data for.
”.
Sinch as a Processor.
Sinch also acts as a “processor” for most of our services.
In that case we process personal data on behalf of our customers (which are mainly companies and institutions).
As Processor, Sinch will only process Personal Data pursuant to the instructions of our customer.
We encourage you to also read the privacy statements and policies of your providers.
Sinch does not review, comment upon, or monitor its Customers’ compliance with their respective privacy statements and policies, nor does Sinch review Customer instructions to determine whether they are in compliance or conflict with the terms of a Customer’s published privacy policy or statements.
If you have a data subject rights request that is connected to data for which We are the processor, we will ask you to contact the company or institution that is the controller of your personal data.
Next questions.
Who provides us with personal data, which information will we have and what will we use the data for.
Who provides us with your personal data.
There are three sources that provide us with personal data.
you yourself, Sinch and third parties.
We might ask you to provide us with personal data in preparation of the concluding of your new customer agreement or when you are in contact with company within the Sinch Group or want to stay up to date and ask for newsletters.
Third parties may also have provided information about you.
For example.
if we are working with a third party that helps us collect feedback from our campaign, you might be approached by them to provide information (if you agreed to this).
You will be told clearly whether this information is collected anonymously or that your feedback is provided to us with information that allows us to identify you (most of the time, we will leave the choice to you.
).
You are then informed about this by this third party (or they inform you together with us).
They are responsible for ensuring that the data they provide to us is provided in compliance with applicable data protection law.
And thirdly, Sinch may also produce new personal data in the coming months.
For example.
When you are included in our CRM system as you have showed interest in receiving a newsletter or want to be contacted by our salesperson, we may also add information on what kind of information we have provided you with, why you are interested in our services etc.
We do not process personal data of children.
Protecting the privacy of children is important to Sinch.

Disclosures for the purposes of defending our legal position or authority requests under “legitimate interest”.
We reserve the right to disclose information as required by law or regulation and when We believe that disclosure is necessary to protect Our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
Notwithstanding any provisions herein, We may disclose Personal Data to governmental authorities when required or reasonably requested to do so by such governmental authorities.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent that it is in conflict with any law that may be applicable to the Personal Data of a Data Subject.
One topic that we need to explain according to the GDPR, is why we consider that we have a legitimate interest for processing part of this personal data.
Sinch is very much a global organisation and plans all work globally or for specific regions (e.
g.
EU) or departments (e.
g.
Engineering) or even products (e.
g.
our Sinch SMS products).
In order to be able to do this and to fulfil the obligations that we and Sinch Group has, the personnel that is responsible for this, needs to be able to plan and execute, and need data for this.
Personal data will also be stored based on Sinch’s legal interest to defend itself against alleged legal claims for as long a claim can be invoked against Sinch.
This may for example be when a customer has terminated his agreement or has gone bankrupt and we need to make sure that all communication surrounding this termination/bankruptcy is documented and kept as long as necessary.
That does not mean that we just provide the information to anyone without limitations.
We do look at the nature of the data and whether it is necessary for our purpose.
If not, then we do not use it.
We will, of course, only use data in ways that you would reasonably expect and that have a minimal privacy impact (we put appropriate safeguards in place, such as limiting access to the information and anonymise/pseudonymise the personal data where possible).
Based on the reasons we want to process the personal data and our efforts to minimize the privacy impact, we do not expect that it is likely that you will object to it.
If you might want to object to it or just would like to receive more information, please read “Right to object” below, and contact us on .
In the context of the purposes that we addressed above, such as for example the transmission of personal data within the Sinch Group for internal administrative purposes as described within the matrix we are aware legitimate interest is the basis for the transfer but we also still need to fulfil the requirements on transferring personal data to a company in a third country still apply.
More about this below.
How long will you process my personal data.
We only keep your personal data as long as necessary for the purposes that are described above in the Data Processing Matrix.
as long as we have a legitimate interest, to comply with the relevant law in your country or fulfil a legal request by a supervisor authority.
Most of the time, how long we need to keep the data is decided by law on a local/national level.
It can however be that there are deviations due to legal obligations on Sinch Group.
Accordingly, when the purpose has been fulfilled in relation to a specific type of personal data, we will stop using the personal data for that purpose and, if the same data is not relevant for any other purpose, delete the relevant personal data as soon as reasonably possible.
Deletion is done in accordance with best business practices or as is required in accordance with any ISO or other relevant certifications that the Sinch Group may hold.
If you want us to delete or block your personal data, please go to “how can I make use of my rights.
”.
Who has access to my personal data.
Sinch Internal.
Personal data will only be available to authorized employees holding a position that requires them to process personal data to perform their work.
These employees will only be granted access in accordance with the principle of “least privilege”, meaning that our personnel will only have access to personal data that is strictly necessary for the purpose of the processing to perform their work.
Due to the fact that Sinch carries out business activities in a number of different countries, personal data may need to be transferred to Sinch affiliates and/or subsidiaries outside of your own home country that need to receive the personal data for the Sinch group’s internal administrative purposes or the purposes in this statement.
This transfer is based on a legitimate interest (see above) as it is necessary within the Sinch Group for internal administrative purposes as described within the matrix.
Below you will find a schedule of Sinch Group Companies where Sinch Group employees sit that may have access to your personal data.
