Privacy and Storage of the Drishti System Data.
Through our proprietary products Trace and Flow, Drishti helps factory line operators to increase their efficiency by collecting real time data through a system of cameras distributed throughout the manufacturing process (the “Drishti System”).
The Drishti System is focused on the manufacturing process and not the individual.
Drishti has the utmost respect for individual’s privacy and the Drishti System was specifically designed to not require collection of personally identifiable information (“PII”).
Accordingly, we neither capture nor store PII through the Drishti System.
In addition, the Drishti System does not collect information on identifying features of an employee nor the employee’s name.
The Drishti System collects streams and records video from manufacturing stations at our customer’s facilities.
Drishti cameras are typically mounted overhead above the work area.
The camera position is chosen to focus on the process and not the operator.
This video may contain confidential process and station layout information as well as segments of video where the operator may be identifiable.
The video is streamed from the cameras to Drishti’s cloud servers over an encrypted protocol.
Once in the cloud, the video is stored in an encrypted form in per-customer storage locations.
All customer data is presented back to the customer using Drishti’s web portal which uses Secure HTTP ( web protocol.
All user access to the web portal is authenticated and is limited to users designated by the customer and can further be limited to specific IP addresses if required.
The Drishti System may also (depending in customer needs and use cases) ingest data from the customer’s Manufacturing Execution System (MES).
Such data is also transferred to the Drishti Cloud environment in an encrypted manner and stored in segregated, encrypted databases.
