About cookies and their usage.
Our web site uses third party “cookies”.
A cookie is a file containing a modest amount of data specific to                    a particular client and website (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web                    browser and is stored by the browser.
The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser                    requests a page from the server.
This allows the server to deliver a page tailored to a particular user,                    or the page itself can contain some script which is aware of the data in the cookie and so is able to                    carry information from one visit to the website (or related site) to the next.
Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information                    that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
Cookies can be used by web servers to identify and track users as they navigate different pages on a website                    and identify users returning to a website.
We may use Cookies for remarketing and similar activities.
We use targeting cookies to tailor marketing to you and your interests.
They are also used to limit                    the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising                    campaign.
They remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other                    organizations such as advertisers.
Although these cookies can track your visits to other websites, they                    do not usually know who you are.
Without these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will be less                    relevant to you and your interests.
As part of re-marketing we also may permit certain third party companies to help us tailor advertising                    that we think may be of interest to users and to collect and use other data about user activities on                    our site (e.
g.
, to allow them to tailor ads on third party services).
These companies may deliver ads                    that might also place cookies and otherwise track user behavior.
For this purpose DataArt uses 3rd party                    vendor re-marketing tracking cookies, including the Google Adwords tracking cookie.
This means we will                    continue to show ads to you across the internet, specifically on the Google Content Network (GCN).
It                    is important to note that we are not collecting any identifiable information through the use of Google’s                    or any other 3rd party remarketing system.
The third-party vendors, including Google, whose services we use – will place cookies on web browsers                    in order to serve ads based on past visits to our website.
– Third party vendors, including Google, use                    cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to your website.
This allows us to make special offers                    and continue to promote our company to those who have shown interest.
