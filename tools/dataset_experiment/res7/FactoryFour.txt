Industrial-Grade Data Security & Compliance.
At FactoryFour, we understand different sectors of manufacturing require the unique storage and transfer of data.
We are committed to providing fully-compliant manufacturing software and educating manufacturers on                        best-practices and risk factors to avoid non-compliance in the midst of a vast and stringent regulatory landscape.
Our Certifications.
ITAR & EAR                                ITAR specifically regulates the import and export of defense-related products, data and services that appear on the United States Munitions List.
EAR is a parallel regulation that focuses on dual-use items available                                for commercial sale and government use, appearing on the Commercial Control List.
Both are strict regulations aimed at preventing sensitive data from being accessible by foreign nationals, and software providers must                                structure their applications specifically to achieve this.
FactoryFour is ITAR and EAR compliant, hosting our applications on a separate, compliant server and engaging in best practices to avoid violation.
