Schindler - Privacy Policy.
Last updated April 2022.
Thank you for visiting this website or websites under the operation and control (collectively the “Sites”) of Schindler Elevator Corporation (“Schindler”) and your interest in Schindler products and services.
Your privacy is important to us and we want you to feel comfortable visiting our Sites.
In view of this, we have created this Privacy Policy.
The Internet is generally not a secure environment.
You acknowledge that the Internet is an open network and can be accessed by anyone.
Schindler controls and operates the Sites from its offices in the United States of America and does not represent that materials on the Sites are appropriate or available for use in locations outside Canada and the United States of America.
Schindler treats personal information in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and is committed to protecting the privacy of certain data that is collected from you and that you submit when you access the Sites.
We recognize the sensitive nature of much of the information with which we are entrusted on a daily basis, and we are committed to the highest standards of privacy.
The following outline is intended to familiarize you with our policies for the gathering, use, disclosure, maintenance and protection of private information both online as well as offline.
The examples given are intended to be for illustrative purposes only, and therefore, should not be considered a complete representation of our practices.
Please review this policy carefully.
Schindler reserves the right to change its Privacy Policy at any time, in which event the Sites will contain a notice of the change.
Changes will be effective immediately upon posting to the Sites.
By accessing the Sites, you are indicating your agreement to Schindler’s Privacy Policy.
If you have any questions or concerns about any of our practices, please contact us at .
1.
Accountability.
Schindler strives to be accountable for all personal information under its control.
This includes personal information under our direct control, as well as personal information that we may transfer to our affiliates or third-party service providers for servicing, processing, storage or other purposes that facilitate our business operations.
We use contractual or other appropriate means to require third parties that provide services on our behalf to maintain a level of privacy protection comparable to our own practices.
Numerous individuals within Schindler are responsible for the day-to-day collection and processing of personal information including our sales associates and account and administrative personnel.
Schindler has designated a Privacy Officer who is accountable for the handling of all personal information under Schindler’s control and for ensuring that the principles set out in this Policy are complied with.
2.
What are the purpose and the scope of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy applies to personal information Schindler collects in the course of operating our business in Canada and the United States, including online through the Sites.
The Sites are intended for use of persons residing in Canada and the United States and for delivery of products and services within Canada and the United States.
This Policy does not apply to any information that is exempted from the definition of "personal information" in applicable privacy legislation.
This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information Schindler collects, the methods of collection and the purposes for which Schindler may use, share or disclose such information.
By way of example, the term “personal information” refers to information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, or telephone number, etc.
that can be used to identify you and information we collect and maintain in combination with information that can be used to identify you, or as otherwise defined by applicable law.
By using Schindler Sites, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
The Sites are not directed to children.
Schindler does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
If you are concerned about your child’s use of the Sites, you may use web-filtering technology to supervise or limit access to the Sites.
3.
What information do we collect about you.
Either before or when we collect personal information from you, we will explain how we intend to use and disclose it.
We will limit the collection of personal information to that which is necessary to accomplish the identified purposes and will use and disclose it only for those purposes.
If we wish to use or disclose your personal information for a new purpose, we will identify such purpose and obtain your consent prior to use or disclosure for such purpose, unless such consent is not required by law.
As you are probably aware, in the course of our relationship with you, we may collect information from a variety of sources.
We collect this information in order to carry out our business functions and provide the highest quality of service to you, to conduct research, and to provide internal reporting.

If you choose to withhold any personal information requested by us, it may not be possible for you to gain access to or use certain parts, services or functions of the Sites and for us to respond to your query.

Express consent may be obtained verbally, online or in writing.
Implied consent may be obtained when you approach us to obtain information, inquire about or order products or services from us, or through your use of a product, service or one of the Sites.
You may withdraw your consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information at any time, on reasonable notice, subject to legal or contractual restrictions.
We will inform you of the implications of doing so.
For instance, withdrawal of consent may make it impossible for us to provide certain products or services to you.

Information sharing | Data transfer abroad.
Schindler will not trade, rent, license or sell your personal information to third parties.
California residents.
We do not sell the personal information of California residents for a business purpose.
In the course of our normal business activities, we may disclose collected information to both affiliates and non-affiliated entities, as we deem necessary.
We will not disclose your information for any purposes other than those in conjunction with the business activities requested of us unless otherwise permitted or required by law.
The business activities include the provision of administration and other related services and performing other functions of our business.
Affiliated entities are within the Schindler family of companies, while non-affiliated entities are those outside of the Schindler family of companies with which we conduct our activities.
As Schindler is a global and worldwide acting company, we may disclose your personal information to other Schindler affiliates worldwide that may use such personal information for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy, but also agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
Your personal information may therefore be transferred to countries with a different level of data protection than the country from where you have submitted your personal information.
Your personal information may be disclosed to third parties if we are required to do so because of applicable law, legal proceedings or responding to court, law enforcement, governmental or other legal requests, or if such disclosure is otherwise necessary in support of any criminal or other legal investigation or proceeding here or abroad, or because of an overriding interest of Schindler.
Your information may also be disclosed to third parties, including abroad, who act for us or on our behalf, for further processing in accordance with the purpose(s) for which the data were originally collected.
Your information may be lawfully processed by third parties for services delivery (e.
g.
evaluating the usefulness of the Sites, marketing, data management or technical support).
These third parties may only process your information in the same way as Schindler is permitted to process it.
We require all service providers to keep your information confidential and secure.
In addition, we require that our service providers not use or disclose the personal information for any purpose other than providing the services on our behalf, except as may be required by law.
Schindler may transfer any information we have about you in connection with a potential or actual merger, amalgamation, acquisition, disposition or sale, of all or part of our business or assets.
7.
Links to other websites.
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Sites, and not to websites owned by third parties.
We may provide links to other websites which we believe may be of interest to you.
However, due to the nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee the privacy standards of such websites or assume responsibility for the contents of websites other than our Sites.
This Privacy Policy is not intended to be applicable to any linked, non-Schindler website.
Whenever you open a link to other websites, you should exercise caution and read the privacy policies of the website in question.

Cookies by themselves do not tell us your email address or otherwise identify you personally.
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Schindler only uses cookies in accordance with applicable laws.
Please ensure that your computer setting reflects whether you accept cookies or have disabled or deactivated them.
You can set your browser to warn you before accepting such tracking technology, or you can also set it to refuse such devices.
The specific instructions can be found in the manual of your browser.

Web Analytics | Opt-out.
Our Sites use Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target.
Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics are used to measure Sites usage, collect non-identifiable and to aggregate information to improve the contents of our Sites or to compile, for internal and market research purposes, anonymous aggregated statistics about individuals using our Sites.
The relevant data is provided to us by Google and/or Adobe  in the aggregate (i.
e.
individual users are not identified) and allows us to better understand our Sites’ audience.
By way of example, the Google Analytics and/or Adobe Analytics features implemented by us allow us (i) to evaluate and generate reports on certain demographic, behavioral, and interest metrics of users collected by Google, and (ii) to create advertising remarketing audiences and campaigns based on such metrics, which may be segmented into aggregated groups.

These tools allow us to monitor the web activity of leads and customer contacts so that we can identify the topics they are interested in and pre-qualify leads for sales.
These tools also help us to understand which topics might be relevant in a sales conversation or which content to provide.
If you do not wish to you have visits on our Sites tracked by our marketing tools, you can opt-out by using the following link.
Opt-out of from marketing tools.
11.
Do Not Track.
“Do Not Track” is a privacy preference that you can set in your Internet search browser that sends a signal to a website that you do not want the website operator to track certain browsing information about you.
However, because our Sites are not configured to detect Do Not Track signals from a user’s computer, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track requests.
12.
Security measures to protect your Personal Information.
No system for safeguarding personal or other information is 100% secure.
However, Schindler uses appropriate security measures in order to reasonably protect your personal information against unauthorized access or alteration, accidental or intentional manipulation, loss and destruction.
For example, our employees are trained to understand the importance of confidentiality and are required to adhere to our privacy policies and procedures.
Employees who violate these policies and procedures are subject to disciplinary action.
We employ numerous practices to protect against the disclosure of information for purposes unrelated to the performance of our business functions or to individuals other than those who must use it in the course of their work activities.
These practices include the use of password protection of computer files, e-mail and voice-mail, video surveillance, and other physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards.
13.
Access to and Accuracy of Personal Information.
You may request access to your personal information in our custody or control, and an account of our use and disclosure of that information, by contacting our Privacy Officer in writing.
In order to verify that the information is being released to the proper individual, you may be asked to provide suitable identification or to otherwise identify yourself.
We will advise you in advance if a minimal charge will apply and we will respond to your request within 30 days.
If we are unable to provide you with a list of organizations to which we have actually disclosed your personal information, we will provide you with a list of organizations to which we may have disclosed your personal information.
In certain circumstances, access to personal information may be denied.
If we deny your request for access to your personal information, we will advise you in writing of the reason for the refusal, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.
You are entitled to challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information and have it amended as appropriate.
In most cases, Schindler relies on you to provide any updates to or correction of your personal information.
Where personal information is used on an on-going basis, Schindler undertakes to correct any information that is shown to be inaccurate, incomplete, or not up-to-date.
Otherwise, we do not routinely update personal information unless it is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the information is collected.
Upon request from you to have any or all of your personal information in our records deleted or destroyed, Schindler may undertake to use reasonable efforts to do so to the extent such information is not required to be retained by law or for any other lawful business purpose, such as the investigation of claims or defence of an action.
California residents.
We will not discriminate against a California resident for exercising his or her rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act, including a request to delete the personal information we collect about them.
For example, we generally will not provide you a different level or quality of goods or services if you exercise a right.
