The query serves to differentiate whether the input is made by a person or abusively by automated machine processing.
The query includes sending the IP address and any other data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service to Google.
For this purpose your input will be transmitted to Google and used there.
However, if IP anonymization is activated on this website, Google will reduce your IP address within Member States of the European Union or in other countries party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand.
Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.

The deviating data protection regulations of the company Google apply to this data.

.
We would like to point out that IP anonymization is active on this site in order to guarantee anonymous collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking).

URL Shorteners.
To provide hyperlinks (including external links), we use URL shortening services provided by Bitly, Inc.
, 139 5th Avenue, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10010, United States, and Yourls ( The legal basis for this is our legitimate interest in the economical operation of our online services in acc.
with Art.
6 para.
1 letter f) GDPR.

Bitly can, for instance track which Bitly links a user has clicked.
Bitly, Inc.
is part of the EU-US Privacy Shield and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield.

Yourls also enables the use of shortened links, but is not hosted by an external provider.

Santa Clara St.

Google Search Console.

When a Google service is used, the data for this service is not collected by us or in our responsibility, but directly by Google.
As proprietor of the domains, Google provides us with access to the analyses and evaluation of the Google data.
As part of this, we only have access to data relating to our domains.
The privacy policy of Google applies to this data, which you can find at.
.
Social Media.
We currently use the following social media plug-ins.
Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn (including SlideShare), Flickr, and YouTube.
We use the so-called Shariff solution.
This means that when you visit our website, no personal data is initially passed on to the providers of the plug-ins.
You can recognize the provider of the plug-in by the marking on the box above its initial letter or the logo.
We offer you the possibility to communicate directly with the provider of the plug-in via the button.
Only if you click on the marked field and thereby activate it, the plug-in provider receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding website of our online offer.
In addition, the data specified in section 2 of this policy will be transmitted.
In the case of Facebook, according to the provider, the IP address is anonymized in Germany immediately after collection.
By activating the plug-in, personal data is transferred from you to the respective plug-in provider and stored there (for US providers in the USA).
Since the plug-in provider collects data mainly via cookies, we recommend that you delete all cookies before clicking on the grayed-out box using your browser's security settings.
We have no influence on the data collected and data processing processes, nor are we aware of the full extent of data collection, the purposes of processing, the storage periods.
We also have no information on the deletion of the data collected by the plug-in provider.
The plug-in provider stores the data collected about you as user profiles and uses these for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website.
Such an evaluation takes place in particular (also for users who are not logged in) for the representation of demand-fair advertisement and in order to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website.
You have a right of objection to the creation of these user profiles, for which you must contact the respective plug-in provider to exercise this right.
Through the plug-ins we offer you the possibility to interact with social networks and other users, so that we can improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user.
The legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is Art.
6 para.
1 letter f) GDPR.
The data is transferred regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in there.
If you are logged in with the plug-in provider, your data collected with us will be directly assigned to your existing account with the plug-in provider.
If you click the activated button and, for example, link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts.
We recommend that you log out regularly after using a social network, especially before activating the button, as this way you can avoid being assigned to your profile with the plug-in provider.
For more information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider, please refer to the data protection declarations of these providers as notified below.
They will also provide you with further information about your rights in this regard and setting options to protect your privacy.
The data provided to us by social media providers are processed by us by means of the social media management software “Hootsuite”.
We have a legitimate interest in using the software in accordance with Art.
6 para.
1 letter f) GDPR.
Hootsuite enables us to manage several social media accounts.
Posts can be prepared, planned, published, liked, and shared, and the channels of different providers can be monitored within Hootsuite to pinpoint relevant discussions in the social web concerning our company, brands, products and services.
We have only limited access to your user data.
The user data primarily includes your publically accessible profile data (cf.
3.
Personal Data).
We have no complete knowledge of the extent to which Hootsuite collects your user data.
