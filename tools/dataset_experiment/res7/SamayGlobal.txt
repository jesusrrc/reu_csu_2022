GOODYEAR GLOBAL PRIVACY POLICY.
Effective as of January 1, 2021.
This Global Privacy Policy sets forth the general privacy principles that Goodyear follows with respect to PII that is processed in our business operations.
In addition to this Global Privacy Policy, there may be specific campaigns, promotions, programs and websites that are governed by additional privacy terms or policies.
Goodyear encourages you to read these additional terms or policies before participating in or utilizing these campaigns, promotions, programs or websites as the processing of your PII in this context will be governed by those additional privacy terms and/or policies.
The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company and its affiliates (collectively, "Goodyear") respect individual privacy and value the confidence of our associates, customers, vendors and others with whom we do business.
Goodyear strives to process Personally Identifiable Information (“PII,” as defined below) in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which we do business, and we pride ourselves on upholding the highest ethical standards in our business practices.
Important note for individuals located in (or whose PII is processed by Goodyear entities established in) the European Union (EU), Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.
This Policy consists of.
this front section, which sets out the general principles applied by Goodyear when processing PII.
and.
an addendum for PII that (i) originates from or (ii) is processed in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland (the "EU Addendum").
If you are located in (or if your PII is processed in) one of the above jurisdictions, Goodyear encourages you to read the EU Addendum, which contains important additional information about the processing by Goodyear of PII originating from or processed in those countries.
Notice to California Residents.
If you are a California resident, you may have certain additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act, California Civil Code Section 1798.
Visit our Your California Privacy Rights page for more information.
Scope.
This Policy applies to any and all forms of “processing” (as defined below) of PII in any format or medium, relating to (i) individuals who are customers, prospective customers, suppliers and prospective suppliers with whom Goodyear does business or (ii) representatives or contact persons of such customers, suppliers, and prospective customers and suppliers.
The Policy does not apply to any information processed about legal entities as such.
Definitions.
For purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply.
“European Economic Area” or “EEA” means the Member States of the European Union plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.
"Personally Identifiable Information" or “PII” means any information or set of information, whether alone or in combination with other Personally Identifiable Information, processed by Goodyear, which is sufficient to identify an individual.
Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is anonymous, nor does it include publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public Personally Identifiable Information.
For PII originating from or processed in the EEA, PII shall have the meaning given to it in the EU Addendum.
“Processing” shall mean any operation or set of operations that is performed upon PII or sets of PII, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction and the verb “to process” shall be construed accordingly.
As used in this Policy, “Goodyear” means The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company and its affiliates.
Privacy Principles.
When processing PII, Goodyear shall follow these principles.
Notice and Consent.
Goodyear endeavors to inform persons whose PII Goodyear collects, in accordance with applicable law.
This includes providing information about (i) the purposes for which Goodyear collects and uses the PII, (ii) the types of third parties to which Goodyear discloses (or may disclose) that PII, and (iii) the choices and means Goodyear offers the subjects of the PII for limiting the use and disclosure of their PII.
Unless otherwise required under applicable law, Goodyear will endeavor to provide notice when persons are first asked to provide PII to Goodyear, or as soon as practicable thereafter.
Unless permitted by applicable law, no PII is collected without first obtaining the consent of the individual for the collection, use and disclosure of that PII.
In some circumstances the consent for Goodyear to collect PII may arise from the nature of the relationship between Goodyear and the individual, or an individual’s interaction with Goodyear, such as by using a Goodyear website or engaging in a transaction with Goodyear.
When you provide PII to Goodyear, you acknowledge that you have read this Policy and, where required under applicable law, consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your PII in accordance with this Policy and other applicable Goodyear privacy policies, such as Goodyear’s Online Privacy Policy.
You may, as provided by applicable law, be free to refuse or withdraw your consent.
Goodyear, and third parties on its behalf, use the PII collected from you for purposes such as, but not limited to, user registration.
administering and tracking a purchase, payment, return, warranty or rebate.
arranging for services.
inviting participation in online surveys.
requesting feedback on products and services.
and otherwise communicating with you through various channels.
Choice.
Subject to any stricter requirements under applicable law, Goodyear will endeavor to offer persons whose PII it possesses an opportunity, where feasible and reasonable under the circumstances, to choose whether their PII is to be (a) disclosed to a third party, or (b) used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.
Goodyear will endeavor to provide individuals with mechanisms, reasonable under the circumstances, to exercise their choices.
If your PII is originating from or processed in the EEA, please refer to the section “Your Rights” in the EU Addendum for an overview of your rights in this context.
Access and Correction.
Upon request and/or when required or otherwise appropriate, and within periods (if any) set by applicable law, Goodyear will endeavor to grant individuals reasonable access to the PII that Goodyear holds about them.
Such access may be denied by Goodyear where the denial is permitted by applicable law and every request from an individual will be assessed on a case by case basis.
In the event a request is denied, Goodyear will notify the individual regarding the reasons for denial in writing.
Consistent with how your PII is maintained in the ordinary course of Goodyear's business, Goodyear will provide the information in an understandable form.
We may impose a reasonable charge when a request is made (e.
g.
, for photocopying or postage) to the extent permitted under applicable law.
In addition, Goodyear will endeavor to take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete PII that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete.
To guard against fraudulent requests for access, Goodyear may require sufficient information to allow it to confirm the identity of the individual making the request before granting access.
If your PII is originating from or processed in the EEA, please refer to the section “Your Rights” in the EU Addendum for an overview of your rights, including your right of access and correction.
Data Integrity.
Subject to any stricter requirements under applicable law, Goodyear will endeavor to use PII only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which the PII was collected or in ways that are subsequently authorized by the individual.
Goodyear will endeavor to take reasonable steps to ensure that PII is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.
Disclosure and Transfer to Third Parties.
Goodyear is not in the business of selling PII to others, but may share your PII with subsidiaries or affiliates controlled by Goodyear, and with third party service providers that perform services on Goodyear’s behalf.
Examples of these services include fulfilling orders, sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, providing customer service, requesting feedback on products and services, and sending you marketing and promotional materials, service updates and reminders.
For PII originating from or processed in the EEA, a list of the relevant categories of third-party recipients can be found in the EU Addendum (see section “Third-Party Recipients”).
Goodyear may buy or sell stores, subsidiaries or business units.
In these types of transactions, PII is generally one of the business assets that is transferred.
That PII remains subject to the obligations stated in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.
In the event that Goodyear or substantially all of its assets are acquired, PII will be one of the transferred assets.
Cross-Border Transfers Originating From the EEA.
If your PII is originating from or processed in the EEA, please refer to the paragraphs “Legal Basis for the Processing” and “Transfers Outside the EEA” in the EU Addendum.
Cross-Border Transfers Not Originating From the EEA.
Because Goodyear does business in many countries, PII collected by Goodyear in one country may be processed in another country, the laws of which may provide different levels of protection from those in the country where the PII was first collected.
PII gathered in one country may be subject to access by and disclosure to law enforcement agencies of jurisdictions other than the country where the PII was first collected.
Goodyear also may share PII with organizations and entities that perform services on its behalf, and these organizations and entities may be located in countries other than the country in which the PII was first collected.
Goodyear will endeavor to obtain appropriate and reasonably enforceable assurances from third parties, including its subsidiaries and affiliates, to which it discloses or transfers PII that these third parties will safeguard PII in a manner consistent with this Policy.
When Goodyear becomes aware that a third party is using or disclosing PII in a manner contrary to this Policy, Goodyear will endeavor to take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such use or disclosure.
To the extent applicable law requires an individual’s consent before disclosing PII to third parties, Goodyear will endeavor to obtain the individual’s consent prior to such transfer.
There may be circumstances where Goodyear is required to transfer PII without obtaining prior consent, including (i) where required by a court order.
(ii) where Goodyear believes, upon reasonable grounds, that it is necessary to protect the rights, privacy, or safety or property of a person or group of persons.
(iii) where it is necessary to establish or collect monies owing to Goodyear or to complete a transaction with a third party.
(iv) where it is necessary to permit Goodyear to pursue available remedies or limit any damages we may sustain.
or (v) where the information is public.
When Goodyear is obliged or permitted to disclose PII, Goodyear will endeavor not to disclose more than is required.
Goodyear may also make disclosures permitted by its Online Privacy Policy.
Security.
Goodyear takes reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect PII in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, and to respond to the misuse, loss or unauthorized use of such PII.
Governance.
Goodyear will regularly review compliance with this and other Goodyear privacy policies.
Except to the extent otherwise prohibited by applicable law, any Goodyear employee, associate or contractor that Goodyear determines is in violation of this Policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or engagement.
Dispute Resolution.
Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of PII should be directed to Goodyear at the address given below.
Goodyear will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of PII in accordance with the principles contained in this Policy.
Changes to this Policy.
From time to time, Goodyear may revise this Global Privacy Policy, in which case the date indicated at the beginning of this Global Privacy Policy will be updated.
