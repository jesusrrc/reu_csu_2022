Transfers within AVEVA will be covered by an agreement entered into by the members of AVEVA (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each group company to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within AVEVA.
How long we keep your personal data.
We only keep your personal data for as long as we actually need it.
This would be considered from the perspective of whether or not you would still be interested in receiving information from us about our products and services.
Generally, this means that if you have not replied to our marketing emails or purchased any of our products or services for a period of one year we will remove you from our database.
For further details please contact us at [email protected].
