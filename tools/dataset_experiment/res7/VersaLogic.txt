Information From Your Computer VersaLogic may itself, or through VersaLogic’s third party service providers, collect information about your computer, such as the browser, operating system, IP address, country and other geolocation data, date and time of visit, whether you are using a mobile device, referring websites, the search engine queries you used to get to the Website, the pages of the Website you visit and your activities on the Website such as what images, videos, or other embedded media you view, as well as the amount of time spent on the Website pages, and the number of pages visited.
Some of this information may be collected using cookies, as further explained below.
This information is used for a variety of purposes to improve the Website and its content, including without limitation to gather broad demographic data, identify trends and statistics, help diagnose problems with VersaLogic’s web server, and to administer the Website and its content.
VersaLogic may also collect and share information between pages of the Website for the proper functioning of the Website, as well as authentication.
VersaLogic may also use this information to provide you with information and advertising regarding VersaLogic’s products and services.
Cookies The Website may use “cookies” to provide information on your computer.
Cookies are pieces of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer or device.
VersaLogic may use both session and persistent cookies on VersaLogic’s own or through VersaLogic’s third-party service providers as described below.
Cookies may save your preferences while you are at the Website, such as allowing for persistent login on pages that require logging in, and VersaLogic may use them to provide you with tailored information as you use the Website services.
By modifying your browser preferences, you may have the choice to accept cookies, to be notified when a cookie is sent, or to reject cookies.
The rejection or limitation of cookies by your browser may limit your ability to use the Website.
Third-Party Service Providers VersaLogic may use a variety of third-parties to help provide VersaLogic services, to help VersaLogic understand the use of VersaLogic services, provide information and provide advertising regarding the Website and VersaLogic products and services.
Third-party services providers may include, but are not limited to third party web analytics services and a variety of third party social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

Google Analytics and Facebook VersaLogic may use services through companies such as Google to target ads to you related to your usage of the Website, such as to display advertising for the Website, products, and services, on other websites you visit based on your activities on the Website in the past.
Google may use the data collected to track and examine the use of the Website, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services.
Google may also use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.
Google Analytics uses “cookies” — text files that are saved on your computer and that enable the analysis of your use of the Website.
The information generated by the cookie about your usage of this Website is generally transmitted to a Google server in the United States and saved there.
Due to the activation of IP anonymization on these Web pages, however, your IP address will be truncated by Google beforehand within the member states of the European Union and other signatory states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be passed to a Google server in the United States and truncated there.
On behalf of the operator of this Website, Google will use this information to evaluate your usage of the Website, to compile reports about Website activities, and to render further services for the Website operator in relation to Website and Internet usage.
The IP address transmitted by your browser for the purposes of Google Analytics will not be associated with other Google data.

The Website may use Google conversion tracking.
If you reach VersaLogic’s Website via an ad controlled by Google, Google AdWords places a cookie on your computer.
The cookie is used for conversion tracking if a user clicks on an ad controlled by Google.
If the user visits certain pages on VersaLogic Website and the cookie has not yet expired, VersaLogic and Google are able to detect that the user in question clicked the ad and was forwarded to the relevant page.
The information collected using the conversion cookie enables the creation of conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have chosen to use conversion tracking.
The customers are told the total number of users who clicked their ad and were forwarded to a page with a conversion tracking tag.
However, they do not receive any information using this system that can be used to personally identify users.
If you do not wish to take part in tracking, you can decline the setting of the relevant cookie by means of a browser setting that generally deactivates the automatic setting of cookies.
Please note that you must not delete the corresponding opt-out cookies if you wish to continue preventing measurement data from being recorded.
If you delete all of the cookies in your browser, you must set any required opt-out cookies again.
You can prevent the collection of the data generated by Google Analytics in relation to your use of the Website and the processing of this data by downloading and installing the browser plug-in, with more information regarding how you can opt out of Google Analytics data collection as instructed here.
This link provides instructions for installing an opt-out cookie on your device.
As a result, the collection of data by Google Analytics is prevented in future for this Website and for this browser as long as the opt-out cookie remains installed in your browser.

In addition, VersaLogic may use and disclose customer information in special instances when VersaLogic has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to investigate, identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with VersaLogic’s rights or property, or the rights or property of others.
VersaLogic may disclose visitor information when subpoenaed, if ordered or otherwise required by a court of law, arbitrator, or other similar proceeding or the rules governing such a proceeding, for government investigations, with government agencies if required by law, and when VersaLogic otherwise believes in good faith that any applicable law requires it.
