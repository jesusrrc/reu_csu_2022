Privacy Policy​.
Serious Integrated, Inc.
(“SERIOUS,” “We,” or “Company”) is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected.
This Privacy Policy explains how We use the information We collect about you, how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and the procedures that we have to safeguard your privacy.
This Privacy Policy applies to the information requested from you when you access  or  (the “Sites”).
Other websites that may be affiliated with SERIOUS may have different privacy policies.
Information Collected.
We may collect your personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) when you use our Sites.
Most of the Personal Information you give us is collected when you request literature/ information, participate in a contest, fill out a questionnaire/survey, or participate in an on-line discussion.
If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site(s), you may be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Company.
This may happen when you purchase product, sign up for services, or if you desire to receive marketing materials and information.
Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your full name, username, password, email address, mailing address, time zone, telephone number, location, application information, buying preferences and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in any online profile.
We use the information that you provide us to respond to your requests, customize your interactions with us, improve our offerings, provide materials or offers to you, allow you to participate in contests, and communicate with you.
We may also collect information that is provided to us by your browser or your interaction with our Sites.
This may include information on the browser you used to come to our web site, the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the web site that you visited just before visiting our web site, which pages on our web site you visit, your activities on our web site, any search terms you entered, which URL you go to next, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.
Use of Cookies and Web Beacons.
A “cookie” is a small data file that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system.
We use cookies to better serve you when you return to our web site.
Some of our web pages may send cookies when you visit our web site, make purchases, respond to online surveys or promotions, participate in a contest, or request information.
Accepting the cookies used on our Sites enables our web servers to identify your system by reading the cookie that has been stored on your system, but our web server cannot identify you unless you enter your Personal Information.
Cookies that are placed when visiting our Site cannot be used to obtain your Personal Information at another site.
Cookies may also enable you to register and login to access different portions of our Sites that may require a username and password.
The information collected online permits us to analyze traffic patterns on our Site and is used on an anonymized basis.
This can enable us over time to provide users with a better experience on our Site(s) by improving the content and making it easier to use.
The information collected online also allows us to contact you (but only to the extent permitted by applicable law), regarding our products and services that may be responsive to your needs or browsing history.
Depending on the browser used, you can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it, and you can also set your browser to turn off cookies.
However, if you do so, some areas of the Sites may not function properly, or you may be required to re-enter your Personal Information to use an area of the Sites.
We may also use web beacon technologies to better tailor the Sites to provide better customer service.
A web beacon is a single pixel GIF that allows a web site to count users who have visited that page or access certain cookies.
These web beacons may be placed on specific pages across this web site.
When a visitor accesses these pages, an anonymous notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our vendors.
These web beacons work in conjunction with cookies.
If you don’t want to associate your anonymous cookie information with your visits to these pages, depending on the browser used, you can set your browser to turn off cookies.
Certain services or features can use information about your location to provide services you request or personalize your experience.
Location information may include data identifying nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, as wells as Global Position System (GPS) data.
The Sites utilize Google Analytics for collection and processing of anonymous data and statistics.
More information is available at .
Use of Your Information.
Information is collected and used in various ways, including the following.
Browsing – When you visit the Sites, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website as Log Data.
This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the websites you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click.
For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on.
We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Sites, for technical administration, to help run our Sites more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, to monitor the nature and level of activity on our Sites, to contact you regarding our products and services (but only to the extent permitted by applicable law), and to evaluate the effectiveness of any advertising and promotions.
If required by applicable law, such information is only used on an anonymous basis to the extent technically possible, unless you expressly consent otherwise.
We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Site Usage or this Privacy Policy.
Technical Support – When you request technical support for your SERIOUS products, this information is necessary to identify your products or systems, understand the configuration of the products, diagnose your questions, and provide solutions.
Online Surveys and Opinion – When you volunteer to complete surveys or participate in opinion polls, We use this information to improve our products and services.
Promotional Activities – When you enter a contest or other promotion, We may ask you for information such as your name, address and e-mail address to administer the program or activity, to send you promotional e-mails (provided that, if required under the applicable law, you consented to the receipt of the emails), notify winners and make the winners’ list publicly available in compliance with laws which may apply to such activities.
Newsletters and Promotional E-mails – As a service to our customers, we may e-mail to you newsletters, promotional information and other information, using your Personal Information collected online.
These e-mails will only be sent to you if you have agreed to receive them or, insofar this is sufficient under the applicable data protection laws, if you have the right to opt out from further receiving them.
Contact Information – If you contact us, We may keep a record of your correspondence or comments, including any information therein, but only to the extent permitted by applicable law.

You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity’s planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of the Company or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the laws of the State of Arizona.
