General information.
Personal data are all types of information that refer to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”), such as your name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and IP address.
We collect and use personal data only to the extent necessary to provide a functioning website and our content, products, and services.
We collect and use our users’, customers’, and business partners’ personal data only with the consent of the data subjects or if the processing of the data is permitted by statutory regulations.

1 For what purpose are my data processed.
We use the personal data you supply to answer your inquiries, provide services, process your orders, and develop and manage our business relationship with you, your company, or your employer.
You can find details in sections 2-6.
1.
2 How and for what purpose are my data disclosed to third parties.
We only disclose or otherwise transfer your personal data to third parties if this is necessary for the purposes of establishing a contractual relationship, entering into or implementing a contract, invoicing, collecting charges (for example, shipping companies or payment service providers), asserting our claims or in the course of the (partial) sale of our company.
In addition, we are authorized by order of the competent public authority in each specific case to provide information about data to the extent that this is necessary for the purposes of criminal prosecution, for the prevention of danger by the police authorities of the federal states, in performance of the statutory tasks imposed by the federal and state constitutional protection authorities, the Federal Intelligence Service (Bundesnachrichtendienst), or the Military Counterintelligence Service (Militärischer Abschirmdienst), or for the enforcement of intellectual property rights.
In these cases, the legal basis is Art.

If your personal data are processed, you are a data subject as defined by the GDPR and you have the following rights in relation to the data controller.
a) Access, rectification, restriction of processing, and erasure.
You have the right, at any time and free of charge, to access your personal data stored by us and to obtain information about the source and recipients of the data and the purpose of the data processing via our websites.
Furthermore, you have the right to the rectification, erasure, and restriction of processing of your personal data, provided that the statutory requirements for this are met.
b) Right to data portability.

We can fulfill this right by providing an export of your personal data that we have processed.
c) Right to information.
If you have exercised your right to have the data controller rectify, erase, or restrict data processing, the controller is obliged to inform all the recipients of your personal data of the rectification, erasure, or restriction of processing unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.
You have the right to be informed by the controller about these recipients.
d) Right to object.
You have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to object at any time to the processing of the personal data concerning you, that may be processed in accordance with Art.
6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR.
this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
If you object, the controller will no longer process your personal data unless the controller has compelling, legitimate reasons for processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or unless the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims.
If the personal data concerning you are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of the personal data concerning you for the purpose of this marketing.
this also applies to profiling, to the extent that it is associated with this direct marketing.
If you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data concerning you will no longer be processed for these purposes.
You have the option to exercise your right of objection in connection with the use of information society services by means of automated procedures using technical specifications, notwithstanding the provisions of Directive 2002/58/EC.
e) Withdrawal of declarations of consent under data protection law.
In addition, you may withdraw your consent at any time, with future effect, by contacting us using the contact details given below.
For information about withdrawing your consent in connection with our use of cookies and similar technologies, please see section 2.
3 e).
f) Automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling.
In accordance with Art.
22 GDPR, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.
This does not apply if the decision.
(1) is necessary for entering into or performance of a contract between you and the data controller.
((2) is authorized by European Union or Member State law that the controller is subject to and that also lays down suitable measures to safeguard your rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests or.
(3) is based on your explicit consent.
However, these decisions must not be based on special categories of personal data according to Art.
9(1) GDPR unless Art.
9(2)(a) or (g) GDPR applies and appropriate measures have been taken to safeguard your rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests.
In the cases referred to in (1) and (3), the controller must take reasonable measures to safeguard your rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests, including at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express your own point of view, and to contest the decision.
g) Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to complain to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State where you are resident or working or where the alleged infringement occurred, if you believe that the processing of personal data concerning you infringes the GDPR.
The supervisory authority where the complaint has been lodged will inform the complainant of the status and the results of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Art.
78 GDPR.
1.
4 What security measures have we taken to protect your data.
We have adopted a large number of security measures to provide adequate and appropriate protection for personal data.
Our databases are protected by physical and technical measures as well as procedural measures that restrict access to information to specifically authorized people in accordance with this privacy policy.
Our information system is protected by a software firewall in order to prevent access from other networks connected to the Internet.
Only employees who need the information to perform a certain task receive access to personal information.
Our employees are trained in security and data protection practices.
When collecting and transferring data via our websites, we use standardized SSL encryption technology.
In the order process, personal data are protected by SSL encryption, identifiable by the padlock icon and the prefix “ in the address bar.
If a password is necessary for access to our websites, you should never disclose it to third parties and you should change it regularly.
In addition, when accessing our websites you should not use the same password that you also use on other websites with password-protected access (email account, online banking, etc.
).
When you have left our pages, you should log out and close your browser to prevent unauthorized users from accessing your user account.
If you communicate with us by email, we cannot guarantee full data security.
1.
5 Transfer to third countries.
If the recipients of your data and their service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or process your data outside the EEA, we will ensure that your personal data are adequately protected (e.
g.
by means of an adequacy decision).
The data protection regulations that apply in countries outside the EEA may be different from those in the country where you are resident.
Under certain circumstances, the national law may provide less protection than that of the country where you are resident (e.
g.
because national regulations allow investigative bodies more far-reaching rights of access to personal data).
WPlease note that the USA is a third country that does not provide adequate data protection.
This means that the level of data protection in the USA is not comparable with that of the EU.
If data are transferred to the USA, there is the risk that the US authorities will access the data via monitoring programs based on Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Executive Order 12333 or Presidential Police Directive 28, without EU citizens having effective legal protection against accesses of this kind.
If your personal data are transferred to third countries that do not provide adequate data protection, we will take measures to ensure that your personal data have appropriate protection in these countries (e.
g.
among other things by using the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission, if necessary with additional protective measures).
We can provide information about the protection mechanism via the contact details given in the first subsection of sections 2 ff.
1.
6 Amendments to this privacy policy.
The date of this privacy policy is given directly under the heading.
We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy as required and without prior notification.

3 Cookies.
We use cookies on our websites.
Cookies are small amounts of data in the form of text information that the web server sends to your browser.
These cookies are only stored on your hard disk.
Cookies can be read only by the server that previously placed them on your device.
Cookies do not store any personal information, such as your name.
The data stored in the cookies are not linked to your personal data (name, address, etc.
).
a) Transient and persistent cookies.
Transient cookies are automatically deleted when you close your browser.
These include, in particular, session cookies.
They store a session ID, which is used to assign different requests from your browser to the joint session.
This enables our website to recognize your computer next time you visit.
The session cookies are deleted when you log out or close the browser.
We use transient cookies to make our website more user-friendly.
Some elements of our website require the calling browser to be identified even after a page change.
The following data, for example, are stored and transferred in the cookies.
Browser settings regarding cookies (whether they are activated or not).
Language settings of the user.
Login information.
We also use persistent cookies on our website that enable us to analyze users’ browsing behavior.
Persistent cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period, which can vary depending on the cookie.
This allows us to record and analyze the click behavior of users on our websites (the data recorded include, for example, browser data, click frequency, click-through rate, etc.
).
The data collected via persistent cookies are pseudonymized using technical measures, which means that it is no longer possible to associate the data with the user.
The relevant data are not stored together with other personal data belonging to the users.
b) Tracking/web bugs.
Some of our services also use tracking/web bugs or tracking pixels.
These are usually code snippets measuring only 1x1 pixel, which are able to identify and recognize your browser ID – the individual fingerprint of your browser.
This allows the service provider to see when and how many users have accessed the pixel, or whether and when an email was opened or a website visited.
To block web bugs on our websites, you can use tools such as webwasher, bugnosys, or AdBlock.
To block web bugs in our newsletter, please change the settings of your email program so that no HTML is displayed in messages.
You can also block web bugs by reading your emails offline.
Unless you give your explicit consent, we will not use web bugs to collect personal information about you or to transfer this information to third parties and marketing platforms without your knowledge.
c) Local storage.
To adapt our services to your needs and make you tailored offers, we use local storage technology in addition to cookies.
This technology involves storing certain data in the local cache of your browser.
These data are retained after you have closed the browser and can be accessed and read by us again on your next visit to our websites.
Local storage enables us to store your preferences for the use of our websites.
The data from the local storage are used on our websites so that, for example, you do not have to make certain selections again after your initial input (Jobcenter/FAQ), so that your choice of certain formats on our websites is retained the next time you visit, or that you are shown an initial selection of interesting articles when you visit the websites.
d) Legal basis for the use of cookies, web bugs, tracking pixels, etc.
The legal basis for the processing of personal data using technically necessary cookies is Art.
6(1)(f) GDPR in conjunction with section 25(2)(2) of the German Telecommunications and Telemedia Data Protection Act (TTDSG).
The purpose of using necessary cookies is to simplify the use of websites for users.
Some functions of our website cannot be offered without the use of cookies.

The user data collected by necessary cookies are not used to create user profiles.
Technologies for increasing the functionality and for analytical and marketing purposes are used to improve the quality of our website and its content.
The analysis cookies enable us to learn how the website is used and to continuously optimize our offering.
Processing, in particular on your device, that is based on cookies or other identifiers (e.
g.
browser fingerprints, pixels, local storage) (referred to as “cookies”) and is not technically required for the function of our websites, will be carried out by us only with your consent, which you can grant via our cookie banner when visiting our websites for the first time.
The legal basis for this cookie-based processing is Art.

After the conclusion of the contract, it may be necessary to store the contractual partner’s personal data in order to comply with contractual or statutory obligations.
As a user, you can cancel your registration at any time.
You can have your stored data modified at any time.
Simply email us at info[at]durr.

If the data are necessary for the performance of a contract or for steps prior to entering into a contract, premature erasure of the data is only possible if this is not prevented by contractual or statutory obligations.
c) Contact options, chat function.
We offer you various contact options, e.
g.
contact via the email addresses provided, a chat function, and a contact form, for certain functions of our website (e.
g.
inquiries from customers, visitors, or the press).
We use the services of HubSpot in this connection as well (see section 5.
2 b)).
The data transferred via the contact form or chat function, and the fact of its use, and the user’s data transferred in the email are stored.
This includes the participants in the chat, the time and content of the messages, the users, and the forms they used.
HubSpot evaluates this information in aggregated form against the total number of uses of the respective form.
We use your data solely to process your request and can contact you for this purpose using the contact data provided.
The legal basis for processing data that are transferred in the course of contacting us is Art.
6 (1)(f) GDPR and our legitimate interest in responding to the inquiry.
If the aim of making contact is to enter into a contract, then the legal basis for processing is Art.
6 (1)(b) GDPR.
The data are erased as soon as they are no longer needed for the purpose they were collected for.
The personal data that you have sent to us for the purpose of making contact will be erased once the relevant conversation with you has come to an end.
The conversation is deemed to have ended when it is clear from the circumstances that the matter in question has been conclusively resolved.
We generally store the written transcript of the chat together with the conference for a period of four weeks after the chat occurred only insofar as separate erasure from the conference recording is not possible.
However, under some circumstances we are entitled and, in some cases, obligated to store the data for longer, e.
g.
due to a statutory documentation obligation.
d) Video and audio chats and video conferences (e.
g.
webinars or presentations).
As a registered user of our website on the basis of Art.
6 (1)(b) GDPR, when you log in to the website you can visit dedicated chatrooms for your event, where you can speak to our employees, the moderators, and other guests.
Additionally, on our website we offer the option of participating in video conferences of various types (e.
g.
webinars, presentations, panel discussions, networking events).
(1) Microsoft.
In this area, we work with a third-party provider, depending on the format and technology, such as Microsoft and its “Teams” video conference service.
Please note the following information.
Microsoft processes the personal data of the visitors to the events, which we organize using Microsoft Teams, as our processor (we remain the controller responsible for the processing).
However, Microsoft also processes some data (e.
g.
data generated by cookies for measuring the use of the services or other telemetry data) for its own business purposes (e.
g.
invoicing and account management), for Microsoft internal reporting and business modeling (e.
g.
forecasts, revenue, capacity planning, product strategy), combating fraud, and improving core functionality.
This applies regardless of whether or not you yourself have a Microsoft user account and whether or not you are logged in.
Microsoft is a subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation in the USA.
It is therefore possible that your data may be transferred to a data center in the USA.
The transfer is based on the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission and on additional assurances made by Microsoft to the users.
Please refer to the general Microsoft privacy policy at  We base our use of services such as Teams and the processing of the provider associated with this for its own limited purposes on Art.
6(1)(f) GDPR and our legitimate interest in holding the events in digital form.
(2) b&b Digital GmbH.
To live stream an event, we use the service provided by b&b Digital GmbH (“b&b”).
b&b processes the personal data of the visitors to our events, where we use the streaming service of b&b, as our processor (we remain the controller responsible for the processing).
b&b collects the following personal data.
Login and logout are stored with the time stamp, name and IP address.
Additionally, the streams may be recorded (see “Recordings”).
We base our use of the streaming service of b&b and the processing associated with this on Art.
6(1)(f) GDPR and our legitimate interest in holding the events in digital form.
(3) Sli.
do.
We use the chat function of the service provider sli.
do s.
r.
o.
, Vajnorská 100/A, 831 04 Bratislava, Slovakia (“slido”), which is part of the Cisco Systems Inc.
Group and which, as our processor, processes personal data of the participants (e.
g.
name, email, company), as well as data shared by the participants with other participants via the service (e.
g.
questions, ideas, chat messages).
We base our use of slido’s service and the processing associated with this on Art.
6(1)(f) GDPR and our legitimate interest in communicating with the participants while holding the events in digital form.
If slido transfers the data to third countries, this transfer is based on standard contractual clauses.
(4) Vimeo.
For the purposes of video streaming, we use the services of Vimeo, LLC, 555 West 18th Street, New York, New York 10011, USA (“Vimeo”).
When you view the video stream, information (including your IP address, time stamp, browser, operating system, device information, use behavior, etc.
) is sent directly to the Vimeo servers and transferred to the USA.
If you are logged into Vimeo, Vimeo can directly associate your visit to our website with your Vimeo account.
In accordance with Art.
6(1)(a) GDPR, our data processing is based on your consent, which you give when you register and can withdraw at any time with future effect.
Your consent includes the transfer of your personal data to the USA.
If you do not want Vimeo to directly associate the data collected via our website with your Vimeo account, you must log out of Vimeo before visiting our website.
Please consult the Vimeo privacy policy for information about the purpose and scope of the data collection by Vimeo and the additional processing and use of the data by Vimeo.
.
Recordings.
In individual cases, a recording may be made of the chat, your participation, or your spoken message.
By switching on your camera or your microphone and participating in our event, you consent (in accordance with Art.
6(1)(a) GDPR) to the recording of your image and/or your voice.
If you do not want your voice or image to be recorded, you can withdraw your consent at any time by switching off your camera and/or your microphone.
Please note that withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of any processing that had already occurred.
Even if you switch off your microphone and/or your camera, it is possible to ask questions in writing, either during the event or afterwards.
We store the chats for a period of four weeks after they were recorded, unless separate erasure from the conference recording is not possible, e.
g.
because you asked a question during a conference and your spoken message was recorded along with the conference.
Depending on the event, we keep the recording of the event accessible on the Internet for as long as we deem reasonable.
However, under some circumstances we are entitled and, in some cases, obligated to store the data for longer, e.
g.
due to a statutory documentation obligation.
e) Advertising messages (e.
g.
email newsletters, invitations).
You can register on our website for advertising messages from Dürr AG (e.
g.
newsletters) to obtain more detailed information about our offering or to receive invitations to future events.

Future invitations (tracking).
If you also want to be invited to our events in the future, you can register for the corresponding information service, which is also provided by our service provider HubSpot (for details of HubSpot, see Section 5.
2.
b)).
HubSpot Tracking.
The invitation emails sent by HubSpot on our behalf contain a tracking pixel, which transfers information to HubSpot when you open the email.
We receive this information from HubSpot’s servers to generate statistical analyses, to measure the success of our invitations, and to check whether you were invited, when you register for a future event.
The tracking pixel in the emails is used to track whether the email or a link in the email was opened and also, in some cases, for how long.
If an email is sent to multiple recipients, it is not possible to know who opened the email/link, but only that the email or link was opened by one of the addressees.
This information is also used to produce anonymized analyses, statistics, and evaluations.
