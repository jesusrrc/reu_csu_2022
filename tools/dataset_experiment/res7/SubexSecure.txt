Equal Opportunity Policy.
Objective .
India has enacted the ‘The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act’, 2016 (“RPWD Act”) under which Subex is required to develop and publish a policy, with certain required provisions, related to employment of persons with disabilities (Chapter IV (8)(3)).
The objective is to provide the policy required under the RPWD Act.
The RPWD Act also provides that employers must.
manage complaints related to the Act (Chapter II (3)).
maintain certain records related to employment of persons with disabilities and provide the records for inspection by Authorities (Chapter IV (9)).
and.
maintain certain standards related to accessibility (Chapter VI (15)).
More important than complying with the RPWD Act, this policy is intended to state Subex’s commitment – even without the RPWD Act — to non-discrimination in the workplace and to clearly state that includes both a commitment to ensuring a workplace free of discrimination based on disabilities and a workplace where Subex will make reasonable accommodations to assist persons with disabilities with success in their jobs.
The full policy is stated below but the short form of this policy is.
Subex does not allow discrimination against any person based on Subex makes employment decisions based on merit and provides and promotes equal opportunity to all regardless of disability.
Subex will make reasonable accommodations to persons with disabilities to assist them in succeeding in their jobs.
and.
Subex will comply with applicable law including the RPWD A copy of the RPWD Act is attached for easy reference.
When and to whom does this policy apply.
This policy’s specific provisions apply to Subex Limited and its affiliates in India (together, “Subex” or “Company”).
However, the fact that this policy’s specific provisions only apply to Subex Limited and affiliates in India is not meant, in any way, to undermine or minimize Subex’s general, global, commitment to compliance with the law and to fair, non-discriminatory treatment.
This policy of equal opportunity is applicable to all the aspects of employment cycle, including the application and hiring process, corrective action, promotion and transfer, selection for training opportunities, compensation, termination and the application of service, retirement and employee benefit plan policies.
Consistent with this policy, Subex is committed to making employment decisions based on merit, qualifications, business needs and other job-related criteria and as opposed to caste, creed, disabilities, sex, age, religion etc.
This policy covers all person with disabilities at all stages, including job applicants, interns/trainees, contractors, part-time & full-time employees and including those employees who acquire any disability during their work tenure in Subex.
Standards related to Employment (RPWD Act, Chapter IV, Clause (8)(3)).
Subex will make reasonable accommodations for an individual’s disabilities by reasonably providing facilities and amenities to enable such persons to effectively perform their jobs.
Exactly what accommodations are made will be decided on a case-by-case basis dependent both on the job function and the particular disability.
(Chapter IV (8)(3)(a)).
Subex will also provide a list, as appropriate, of jobs that may have been identified as suitable for persons with disabilities.
However, generally, it should be assumed that most, if not all jobs at Subex can be performed by persons with disabilities with Subex making reasonable accommodations.
Thus, while the RPWD Act appears to require posting a list of jobs, it should simply be assumed that jobs posted by Subex are open for all applicants regardless of disability.
(Chapter IV (8)(3)(b)).
Reasonably accommodations will be provided to any person with a disability during the job application and interviewing process, during on-boarding with the company and post-recruitment such as with respect to performance review, career advancement and training to provide a non-discriminatory environment for all of these purposes.
For example, if accommodations are needed to ensure an employee has wheel chair access to attend an offsite training session, Subex will take reasonable efforts to ensure such access is provided or the training is provided at an alternative location.
Subex will also reasonably accommodate special leaves required as a result of the disability (such as for medical treatments).
(Chapter IV (8)(3)(c)).
In general, reasonable accommodations will be made to ensure assistive devices, barrier free accessibility and other provisions are provided for persons with disabilities.
(Chapter IV (8)(3)(d)).
Subex has appointed a Liaison Officer who will assist with and review the recruitment process and provision of facilities and amenities for compliance with this policy.
The Liaison Officer is also responsible for ensuring Subexians are educated and aware of this policy.
If, at any time during the employment relationship with Subex (whether during the recruiting phase or during employment), an employee with disability requires any accommodation, he/she can immediately bring the issue to the attention of the Liaison Officer.
The Liaison Officer can be contacted at.
EO-Liaison- (Chapter IV (8)(3)(e)).
In no case will a person with a disability be required to pay any part of the costs for providing the reasonable accommodation.
(Chapter IV (8)(4)).
Standards related to Accessibility (RPWD Act, Chapter VI, Clause 15).
Subex will comply with all Guidelines Standards as mentioned under the RPWD Act and Rules 2017, to the extent as applicable.
Subex will comply with standards of accessibility relating to information and communication technology.
Subex will comply with transport (bus) requirements to the extent applicable to Subex.
However, such regulations are generally only applicable to use of cabs with 13 or more seats and, thus, generally not applicable to Subex.
Any person facing accessibility issues with facilities should report to the facilities team or to the Liaison Officer.
Any person facing accessibility issues with the website should contact Marketing team or the Liaison Officer.
Records (RPWD Act, Chapter IV, Clause 9).
As required by the RPWD Act, Subex shall maintain records with the following information.
The number of persons with disabilities who are employed and their dates of employment.
The name, gender and address of each such person.
The nature of the disability for each such person.
The nature of the work being done by each such person.
The kind of facilities and accommodations made for each such.
Maintaining these records shall be the responsibility of the Liaison Officer.
The information shall be maintained in a confidential file which shall only be made available to.
(a) the HR and Legal teams as necessary for evaluation and analysis of obligations of Subex under this policy.
(b) supervisors and managers for the purposes of assuring they understand the accommodations that will be made.
(c) security personnel to the extent required for evacuation planning for emergencies.
and (d) authorities as required under Chapter IV, Clause 9(2).
In all cases, the information that is shared will be limited to only information that is required to be shared to accomplish the purposes of this policy.
Questions, compliments and complaints (RPWD Act, Chapter II, Clause 3).
If you have any questions, compliments or complaints regarding this policy, the primary point of contact should be the Liaison Officer who can be reached at .
If any aggrieved person raises a complaint related to discrimination based on a disability, Subex will conduct an investigation and provide information to the aggrieved person regarding the outcome of the investigation.
Any person who has any questions, concerns or complaints about this policy or any issue related to it, the company encourages the employee to talk to the Liaison Officer, his/her Supervisor, Department Head, respective Human Resources Business Partner, the Corporate Human Resources Department or the Legal Team.
Under no circumstance shall any Subexian (including the Liaison officer, a supervisor or manager or a member of HR or legal) take any retaliatory action based on any person raising any good faith complaint (whether to Subex or to any government official) regarding Subex’s actions related to this policy.

Introduction .
Subex, like all employers, must collect, store and process data relating to its employees, contractors and applicants in order to manage the employment relationship or potential employment relationship.
Subex is committed to being transparent regarding how it collects and uses that data and is committed to meeting its data protection obligations.

Subex collects and processes a range of information about you and the list of such data may seem lengthy at first glance.

Subex collects this information in a variety of ways.
For example, data is collected through application forms, CVs or resumes.
obtained from your passport or other identity documents such as your driving licence.
from forms completed by you at the start of or during employment (such as benefit nomination forms).
from correspondence with you.
or through interviews, meetings or other assessments.
In some cases, Subex collects personal data about you from third parties, such as references supplied by former employers, information from employment background check providers, information from credit reference agencies and information from criminal records checks permitted by law.
Data is stored in a range of different places, including in your personnel file, in Subex’s HR management systems and in other IT systems (including Subex’s email system).
Why does Subex process personal data.
Subex needs to process data to enter into an employment contract with you and to meet its obligations under your employment contract.
For example, it needs to process your data to provide you with an employment contract, to pay you in accordance with your employment contract and to administer benefit and insurance entitlements.
In some cases, Subex needs to process data to ensure that it is complying with its legal obligations.
For example, it is required to check an employee’s entitlement to work in the country of employment, to deduct tax, to comply with health and safety laws and to enable employees to take periods of leave to which they are entitled.
For certain positions, it is necessary to carry out criminal records checks to ensure that individuals are permitted to undertake the role in question.
In other cases, Subex has a legitimate interest in processing personal data before, during and after the end of the employment relationship.
Processing employee/applicant data allows Subex to.
run recruitment and promotion processes.
maintain accurate and up-to-date employment records and contact details (including details of who to contact in the event of an emergency), and records of employee contractual and statutory rights.
operate and keep a record of disciplinary and grievance processes, to ensure acceptable conduct within the workplace.
operate and keep a record of employee performance and related processes, to plan for career development, and for succession planning and workforce management purposes.
operate and keep a record of absence and absence management procedures, to allow effective workforce management and ensure that employees are receiving the pay or other benefits to which they are entitled.
obtain occupational health advice, to ensure that it complies with duties in relation to individuals with disabilities, meet its obligations under health and safety law, and ensure that employees are receiving the pay or other benefits to which they are entitled.
operate and keep a record of other types of leave (including maternity, paternity, adoption, parental and shared parental leave), to allow effective workforce management, to ensure that Subex complies with duties in relation to leave entitlement, and to ensure that employees are receiving the pay or other benefits to which they are entitled.
ensure effective general HR and business administration.
provide references on request for current or former employees.
respond to and defend against legal claims.
and.
maintain and promote equality in the workplace.
Where Subex relies on legitimate interests as a reason for processing data, it has considered whether or not those interests are overridden by the rights and freedoms of employees or workers and has concluded that they are not.
If we keep certain special categories of personal data, such as information about health or medical conditions, it is processed to carry out employment law obligations (such as those in relation to employees with disabilities and for health and safety purposes).
Where Subex processes other special categories of personal data, such as information about ethnic origin, sexual orientation, health or religion or belief, this is done for the purposes of equal opportunities monitoring.
Who has access to data.
Your information will be shared internally within the Subex companies, including with members of the HR and recruitment team (including payroll), your line manager, managers in the business area in which you work and IT staff if access to the data is necessary for performance of their roles.

Subex may also share your data with third parties, for example, in the context of a sale of some or all of its business.
In those circumstances the data will be subject to confidentiality arrangements.
Subex also shares your data with third parties (including Subex (UK) affiliate companies) that process data on its behalf in connection with payroll, the provision of benefits and the provision of occupational health services and travel advisors and travel agencies in connection with your business travel needs.

For how long does Subex keep data.
Subex will generally hold your personal data for the duration of your employment and for seven years following the end of your employment.

If you believe that Subex has not complied with your data protection rights, you may also contact the Information Commissioner.
What if you do not provide personal data.

You may also have to provide Subex with data in order to exercise your statutory rights, such as in relation to statutory leave entitlements.
Failing to provide the data may mean that you are unable to exercise your statutory rights.
Certain information, such as contact details, your right to work in the UK and payment details, have to be provided to enable Subex to enter a contract of employment with you, to process payment of your salary and to administer certain benefits.
If you do not provide other information, this will hinder Subex’s ability to administer the rights and obligations arising as a result of the employment relationship efficiently.

Anti-Bribery Policy.
Introduction .
Subex believes in high principles of integrity in doing its business.
This Policy sets forth the respective principles and rules and how anti-bribery practices are implemented.
This Policy addresses a variety of contexts in which bribery issues may arise.
Applicability & Purpose.
This policy apply to all officers, directors, managers, employees (hereinafter referred as to the “Subexians”) of any Subex group company (“Subex”) (including employees temporarily transferred to affiliates and vendors), agents, representatives or anyone else doing business in the name of or with Subex, including the suppliers, contractors, or subcontractors (collectively referred to herein as “Covered Parties”).
Subex has a zero-tolerance approach to acts of bribery, by Subexians or Covered Parties.
Any breach of this policy will be regarded as a serious matter of concern by Subex which is likely to result in disciplinary action.
It is our policy to conduct all our business in an honest and ethical manner.
The purpose of this policy is to establish controls, implement and enforce effective systems to ensure compliance with all applicable anti- bribery and corruption regulations.
Definition of Bribery.
Bribery means offering, giving or promising (or authorizing someone to offer, give, or promise) an improper benefit, directly or indirectly, with the intention of influencing or rewarding the behavior of someone to obtain or retain a commercial advantage.

Bribes.
A Bribe is an inducement or reward offered, promised or provided in order to gain any commercial, contractual, regulatory or business or personal advantage.
*An inducement is something which helps to bring about an action or desired result.

3.
Extortion.
Directly or indirectly demand or accept a bribe, facilitation payment or kickback through force or threat.
Gifts & Hospitality.
The policy does not prohibit normal and appropriate hospitality to or from third parties.
The practice of giving gifts and hospitality is recognized as an established and important part of doing business.
However, it is prohibited when they are used as bribes.
Subexians must consider that practice of gifts and hospitality varies between countries and sectors and what may be normal and acceptable in one country may not be so in another.
To avoid committing a bribery offence, the gift or hospitality must be.
Reasonable and justifiable in all the circumstances.
Intended to improve the image of Subex, better present its products and services or establish cordial relations.
The giving or receiving gifts or hospitality is acceptable under this Policy if all the following requirements are met.

It complies with local laws and customs.
c.
It does not include cash or a cash equivalent (such as gift certificates or vouchers).
