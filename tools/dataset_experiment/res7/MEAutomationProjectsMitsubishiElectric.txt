Privacy Policy.
We collect various personal data from you when you visit our website.
Personal data are data with which you can be personally identified.
We attach great importance to the issue of data protection.
We handle your personal data confidentially in compliance with the statutory data protection regulations and with this privacy policy.
We would therefore like to inform you in the following privacy policy about the handling of your personal data when you visit our website, in particular which data we collect, what we use this information for and the purpose of the collection.
We would like to point out that the transfer of data via the Internet (e.
g.
during communication via email) may be subject to security gaps.
Complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.

Storage period.
Unless a more specific storage period is indicated in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until such time as the purpose of the data processing is no longer given.
Your data will be deleted if you assert a legitimate right to deletion or if you withdraw your consent to the data processing, provided we have no other legally permissible grounds for the storage of your personal data (e.
g.
retention periods dictated by fiscal or commercial law).
in the latter case the data will be deleted once these grounds no longer apply.
Note on the transfer of data to the USA and other third countries.
Tools from companies located in the USA or other third countries considered not secure with respect to data protection are integrated, among others, in our website.
If these tools are activated, your personal data may be transferred to these third countries and processed there.
We would like to point out that a level of data protection comparable with that of the EU cannot be guaranteed in these countries.
US companies, for example, are obliged to surrender personal data to security authorities without the data subject having recourse to legal action.
It cannot therefore be excluded that US authorities (e.
g.
secret services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on US servers for surveillance purposes.
We have no influence over such processing activities.
We will inform you in this privacy policy which of the technologies and systems used are subject to a data transfer to the USA or another third country.
Your rights in connection with the data processing carried out by us.
You have the right to receive information about the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data at any time and free of charge.
You also have the right to demand the rectification or erasure of these data.
If you have given your consent to the data processing, you can withdraw this consent with future effect at any time.
You also have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances.
Furthermore, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.
You will find more detailed information in this regard and concerning the exercising of your rights at the end of this privacy policy.

Data collection on this website.
Cookies.
Our website uses cookies.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your end device.
So-called session cookies are stored only temporarily and only for the duration of the session and deleted again when you leave our website.
Permanent cookies by contrast remain on your end device until you delete them yourself with your browser or they are automatically deleted by your web browser.
A difference must be made between technically essential cookies and cookies that are not technically essential (e.
g.
for analytical purposes).
Technically essential cookies are necessary for the execution of the electronic communication process or for the provision of specific functions you have requested (e.
g.
for the shopping cart function) or for optimizing the website (e.
g.
cookies for measuring the web audience).
These cookies are stored on your end device at the time you visit our website.
Unfortunately, the operation of our website is not possible without these technically essential cookies.
We use these cookies based on our legitimate interest pursuant to Art.
6 (1)(f) GDPR.
We have a legitimate interest in the storing of cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of our services.
You can set your browser in such a way that you are informed about the placement of cookies and so accept these on a case-by-case basis, accept specific cookies or generally reject all cookies or activate the automatic deletion of cookies when the browser is closed.
Deactivating cookies could restrict the functionality of this website.
Our website uses only technically essential cookies.
No cookies from external companies (so-called third-party cookies) are used nor cookies for analytical purposes.
Server logfiles.
Technical data are collected (so-call server logfiles) when you visit our website.
These include the browser type and version you use, the operating system, the referrer URL, the host name of the accessing computer, the time of the page hit, your IP address and the type of transfer protocol, e.
g.
https.
The collection of these data is carried out based on our legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of our website pursuant to Art.
6 (1)(f) GDPR.
This is only possible with the collection of server logfiles.
Such data is not merged with other data sources.
Making contact by email or telephone.
If you contact us by email or telephone, your contact data, inquiries and the associated information are saved by us.
If your contact with us concerns the performance of a contract or steps to be taken before entering into a contract, your data are collected based on Art.
6 (1)(b) GDPR for the purpose of the performance of a contract.
If this is not the case, the processing of your data is based on our legitimate interest in the fast and effective processing of inquiries we receive pursuant to Art.
6 (1)(f) GDPR.
The inquiries you send to us and their associated information remain with us until they are no longer necessary for the purpose of the storage (especially if the matter has been dealt with) or until you request us to delete the data.
This in no way affects any statutory retention periods.
4.
Social media presence.
We maintain publically accessible profiles in social networks.
You can find the individual networks we use further down.
As a rule these networks can extensively analyze your user behavior.
Visiting our social media presences therefore triggers numerous processing operations relevant for data protection.
When you log in to your social media account and visit our social media presence, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account.
Under certain conditions your personal data can also be collected even if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social network.
In this case data collection is effected via cookies, for example, that are saved on your end device or via the collection of your IP address.
With the aid of these collected data the social media portals can compile user profiles in which your preferences or interests are stored.
This enables the display of interest-based advertising within and outside of the respective social networks.
Insofar you have an account with the respective social network, this interest-based advertising can also be displayed on all the devices on which you are logged in or were logged in.
Our intention with our social media accounts is to ensure the most extensive presence on the Internet as possible and where applicable to promote our company.
This constitutes a legitimate interest pursuant to Art.
6 (1)(f) GDPR.
In addition, we collect your personal data if you contact us via one of our social media accounts.
The type of data collected depends on the data you give us in your message.
At all events we collect the content of your messages, your user name, the date and time you made contact as well as information as to via which social network you contacted us.
We process these data for the purpose of dealing with your inquiry.
The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in the fast and effective processing of all inquiries we receive pursuant to Art.
6 (1)(f) GDPR.
If you contact us via a social network with the aim of concluding a contract for the supply of goods or for the provision of services, we process your data for the purpose of the performance of the contract or execution of the steps to be taken before entering into the contract or the provision of the desired services.
In this case the legal basis for the processing of your data is Art.
6 (1)(b) GDPR.
Data we collect ourselves is deleted by our systems as soon as they are no longer necessary for the purpose of the collection or if you have exercised your right of withdrawal or objection.
This in no way affects any statutory retention periods.
Processing operations of the social networks on the other hand could possibly be based on other legal bases.
These must be indicated by the operators of the social networks.
We have no influence over the storage period of data processed by the social networks for their own purposes.
Please refer to the respective social networks for more detailed information.
