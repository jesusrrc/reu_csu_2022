SketchUp, Trimble, and Your Privacy.
As part of Trimble, we are dedicated to keeping your data private and            secure.
We are also committed to transparency, so we want you to understand            the information we may collect from you and why we collect it.
The            following is a supplement to Trimble’s privacy commitment.
The information we collect falls into three categories.
Purchase Information.
When you purchase or use one of our free products, we collect basic                            information provided by you to ensure a record of your purchase and                            entitlements.
Usage Information.
We capture information that helps us understand your experience with SketchUp, so that we can offer you more helpful content to help you get better at the software you're working with.
We do use some of this information to serve you applicable content through digital advertising, email, and web properties.
Profile Information.
We store information you provide to us to maintain a profile associated                            with your Trimble account.
We use this information to communicate with you,                            and we never share it with third parties unless you explicitly ask us to, helpful content to help you get better at the software you're working with, and you will always have the ability to update, remove, or add information as desired.
You can always manage your SketchUp privacy preferences, and below you’ll find a more detailed look at how our products and services utilize your data.
SketchUp Pro.
What we collect.
SketchUp Pro validates the software license at the time of installation,            and collects activation details when the product starts up.
The activation            details provide anonymized information regarding the environment the            application is running in.
Specifically, we capture the following.
Globally unique user ID - Completely anonymous.
License state - Trial vs Purchased.
Basic product information such as version, operating environment,                language, and OpenGL version.
Network versions of SketchUp Pro also collect information to make sure            that the software is used in compliance with the number of licenses            purchased.
If, for example, a user purchased a network license with 200            seats, we will count how many seats are currently being used and will allow            200 clients to runs concurrently.
SketchUp Pro uses third-party software to collect error and crash            information.
The collection and submission of data is voluntary and you            will be asked whether or not you would like to submit the information at            the time of the crash.
SketchUp Pro relies on Trimble ID for authentication and does not store any            user information within the product.
Trimble ID collects your first and last name, and email address.
This information is required to utilize any products            which require authentication (sign in).

How to access, update, and protect information.
You can access your license information from the SketchUp menu bar.
Updates            to licenses must be made through the                            help of a customer service representative                        in order to protect the validity of the license.
You may also review your license through our license manager.
