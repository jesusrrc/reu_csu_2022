Key ASIC Berhad (“Company”).
Code of Conduct and Ethics for Directors.
1.
Introduction.
A director should recognise that, as a member of the board, he/she has individual and collective responsibility and the exercise of commercial judgement in the Company.
Each director should endeavour to ensure that the Board of directors (“Board”) fulfils its key purpose of safeguarding and improving the Company’s prosperity.
This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors (“Code”) is intended to focus the Board and each director on areas of ethical risk, provide guidance to directors to help them recognize and deal with ethical issues, provide mechanisms to report unethical conduct, and help foster a culture of honesty and accountability.
The Code is part of the Company’s commitment to promote ethical behaviour among the directors and enhance the high standards of personal integrity and professionalism of the directors.
While covering a wide range of business practices and procedures, these standards cannot and do not cover every issue that may arise, or every situation where ethical decisions must be made, but rather set forth key guiding principles and Company policies.
Directors are encouraged to bring questions about particular circumstances that may involve one or more of this Code to the attention of the Chair of the Nomination Committee, who are primarily responsible to administer the Code.
All of our directors must conduct themselves according to the language and spirit of this Code and seek to avoid even the appearance of improper behaviour.
2.
Conflicts of Interest.
Our directors have an obligation to act in the best interest of the Company.
All directors should endeavour to avoid situations that present a potential or actual conflict between their interest and the interest of the Company.
A “conflict of interest” occurs when a person’s private interest interferes in any way, or even appears to interfere, with the interest of the Company, including its subsidiaries and affiliates.
A conflict of interest can arise when a director or a director’s family member takes an action or has an interest that may make it difficult for that director to perform his or her work objectively and effectively.
Conflicts of interest may also arise when a director (or his or her family member) receives improper personal benefits as a result of the director’s position in the Company.
Although it would not be possible to describe every situation in which a conflict of interest may arise, the following are examples of situations where the rules are clear.
•  Accept any benefit, gift or entertainment that would be illegal or result in any violation of law.
•  Accept any gift of cash or cash equivalent (such as gift certificates, loans, stock, stock options) from persons or entities who deal with the Company in those cases where any such gift is being made in order to influence the directors' actions as members of the Board, or where acceptance of the gifts could create the appearance of a conflict of interest.
•  Accept or request anything as a “quid pro quo,” or as part of an agreement to do anything in return for the benefit, gift or entertainment.
•  Participate in any activity that you know would cause the person giving the benefit, gift or entertainment to violate his or her own employer’s standards.
The following are examples of situations which may constitute a conflict of interest.
Situations such as these should be brought to the attention of the Chair of the Nomination Committee for review and clearance before any action is taken.
•  Competing with the Company in similar business.
•  Having an interest in a transaction involving the Company, a customer or supplier (other than as a director of the Company and not including routine investments in publicly traded companies).
•  Receiving a loan or guarantee of an obligation as a result of your position with the Company.
•  Engaging in any conduct or activities that disrupt or impair the Company’s existing or potential commercial relationships.
•  Accepting compensation, in any form, for services performed for the Company from any source other than the Company.
•  Either a director or a member of a director’s family receiving benefits, gifts or entertainment from persons or entities who deal with the Company where a benefit, gift or entertainment is intended to influence the director’s actions as a member of the Board, or where acceptance could create the appearance of a conflict of interest.
Situations involving a conflict of interest may not always be obvious or easy to resolve.
Conflicts of interests involving the directors, or questions concerning potential conflicts, shall be brought to the Chair of the Nomination Committee, who may consult with the Company’s legal counsel as appropriate.
It shall be noted that the above conflict of interest principles and conduct does not apply to actions or transactions that are duly tabled and approved by the shareholders in accordance to the Listing rules of Bursa Malaysia.

The fit and proper assessments on each director within the scope                                                    of                                                    this Policy shall be conducted by the Company both prior to initial                                                    appointments and at regular intervals of at least annually or                                                    whenever the Company becomes aware of information that may                                                    materially compromise a director’s fitness and propriety.

The Company will consider the factors set out in criteria above                                                    in                                                    assessing a director’s fitness and propriety.
The factors shall be                                                    assessed individually, as well as collectively, taking into account                                                    their relative importance.
Failure to meet one factor on its own                                                    does not necessarily mean failure to meet the fit and proper                                                    criteria.
The Company will consider the specific circumstances                                                    surrounding a director’s failure to meet specific factors, such as                                                    the lapse of time since the occurrence of events, other                                                    contributing factors and the significance of the event from the                                                    perspective of potential risks posed to the Company.
