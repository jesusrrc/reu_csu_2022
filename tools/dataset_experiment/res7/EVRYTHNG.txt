Use of the EVRYTHNG Product Cloud.

You agree that EVRYTHNG shall have the right to collect and analyse data and other information relating to the provision, use and performance of various aspects of the Product Cloud Services and related systems and technologies.
EVRYTHNG will be free to (i) use such information and data to enhance its services and for other development, diagnostic and corrective purposes in connection with its services, and (ii) maintain anonymised data, which is obtained in the course of performing services, in EVRYTHNG’s databases for continuous product enhancement, validation of its professional norms and standards development, and for benchmarking and industry standards, provided that (i) such data will only be used or disclosed in an aggregated or other de-identified form (not capable of identifying any individual), and (ii) EVRYTHNG will ensure that where such data is derived from a customer or subscriber’s data, neither customer, subscriber nor any specific transaction or event will be identifiable from any such data or information.

International transfers.
Some of our external third parties are based outside the UK and/or EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they have entered into a contract with us which incorporates the European Commission’s Model Clauses.
