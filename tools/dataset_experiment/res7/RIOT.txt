We do share non-contact info (like your Summoner Name, match history, game stats, and other aggregate or anonymous info), including publicly via the Riot Games API.

Expand.
We share the info we collect with Riot Games-controlled subsidiaries and affiliates that provide services to us so we can more seamlessly operate, support, and improve the Riot Services (such as to facilitate account transfers and provide Player Support in your local language).
Since we’re a global company, this means your info may be transferred to or stored in locations outside your country of residence (see International Data Processing).
To learn more about the Riot Games entity or, where applicable, entities that control and are responsible for your info, see Contact Us below.
We also share info with service providers that operate on our behalf for the purposes discussed in this notice (see Using Info).
For example, when you buy something on the Riot Services, we’ll share your payment-related info with entities we’ve engaged to process payments and provide similar financial services (like fraud prevention).
Other common examples include partners that help us store data, send marketing emails, and provide Player Support services, assist with research and analysis of our services (like research institutions or universities), and third-party social media platforms or apps we permit to link to our products or Riot Services.
We may also transfer your info in some cases to our professional advisers (who are sometimes independent “data controllers”) such as lawyers and accountants (e.
g.
when enforcing our contract with you).
If you share info publicly through interactive features we control, such as voice and text chat, you should understand that this info becomes viewable and/or accessible to others.
We reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor and record your use of them, including for purposes like enforcing our Terms of Service and applicable player behavior requirements (see Communication & Player Behavior and Anti-Cheat & Fraud Prevention.
We may disclose player info in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).

D.
Communication & Player Behavior.
We’ve empowered our players to help enforce our policies (e.
g.
the acceptable use and behavioral policies that we publish from time to time on our websites, apps and games) related to certain in-game behavior.
For example, players may report each other and submit information about their in-game activity and actions to help us determine if the reported behavior constituted a violation of rules and procedures that apply to player conduct, as well as any potential repercussions (such as temporary or permanent account suspensions or chat restrictions).
We also record and store, and reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor voice and text chat and similar details about optional interactions for a period we determine is appropriate to help us, among other things, address disruptive behavior, improve our services, enforce our rules and policies and Terms of Service, and foster a more positive gaming community for our players.
We engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, comply with a legal obligation (e.
g.
to keep the Riot Services safe and secure), and/or because we have a legitimate interest (e.
g.
understanding how the Riot Services are used, keeping them secure, and improving them).
We use both manual (like enabling you to report such behavior through Player Support tickets) and automated (such as machine learning, transcription, and analysis) tools and techniques to support these efforts.
To enable us to monitor compliance with our policies, we develop template patterns of inappropriate behavior (e.
g.
abuse, hate speech, cheating, threats, offensive or inappropriate names), which we consider indicative of prohibited behaviors.
We do this based upon an analysis of actual behaviors on the Riot Services.
We grade these patterns of inappropriate behavior based upon their severity with different consequences (e.
g.
temporary or permanent account restrictions or communications restrictions) for players based upon how serious their conduct is.
If another player makes a complaint about your behavior, our automated tools use these patterns of inappropriate behavior and grading system to compare your behavior over time with these patterns of inappropriate behavior and, if you have engaged in inappropriate behavior, make a decision as to the consequences for you of your behavior.
This primarily helps us enforce our rules and policies, secure the Riot Services, detect and prevent unauthorized activity, and maintain the competitive integrity of our games.
Our complaints procedure may allow you to appeal a decision.
In this case, we may provide you with information that illustrates our rationale and factors that contributed to our decision, along with some tips on how to avoid repeating such behavior in the future.
If you still wish to appeal, you may request one of our agents to review your case who will make a final manual determination as to the correct outcome based on the available evidence.
Please be kind to other players, observe our policies related to player behavior (including our Terms of Service), and always be thoughtful about how you communicate with others.
E.
Anti-Cheat & Fraud Prevention.
We always seek to offer players a fair, fun, and competitive gaming experience on the Riot Services.
Our Terms of Service strictly prohibit use of unauthorized third-party programs that interact with the Riot Services, including mods, hacks, cheats, scripts, bots, trainers, and automation programs.
When you create or use a Riot Games account, purchase things from us, play our games, or otherwise interact with the Riot Services, we may use anti-cheat and fraud prevention technologies (such as anti-cheat software that may run in the background of your device), that may make automated decisions (such as temporary or permanent account suspensions, communications restrictions, removal of content, or limited access to game content) based on the info we collect from or about you (see Info We Collect).
We engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, to comply with a legal obligation (e.
g.
to keep the Riot Services secure), and/or because we have a legitimate interest (e.
g.
understanding how the Riot Services are used, keeping them secure, and improving them).
To enable us to monitor compliance with our anti-cheat and fraud prevention policies, we develop template patterns of inappropriate behavior (e.
g.
cheating, fraud), which we consider indicative of prohibited behaviors.

VI.
YOUR RIGHTS, CHOICES AND CONTROLS.
Summary.
You have rights and choices regarding your use of the Riot Services and the ways we process info.
Since you can interact with us in many different ways, the particular controls available to you often depend on the nature of our relationship.
Expand.
You can use many parts of the Riot Services without ever creating an account, purchasing our products or services, or otherwise submitting info like your name or email address to us.
If you do choose to visit or use the Riot Services, we generally retain the related personal information as long as your account is active or as is otherwise necessary to provide the Riot Services, operate our business (including for legitimate purposes like complying with our legal obligations, managing internal books and records, preventing fraud, resolving disputes, and enforcing our contracts and terms, such as this notice and the Terms of Service) or to achieve the purposes set out in this notice, unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by law.
The precise periods for which we keep your personal information vary depending on the nature of the information, why we need it and relevant legal or operational retention needs.
Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to a contract or other matter, whether the personal information has been aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria.
For example, the retention period applicable for your personal data needed to provide the Riot service to you (such as accessing the games) is limited to your account life.
When your account is deleted, Riot will delete the relevant information for that purpose (providing the service to you) but will keep some personal information (Summoner Name or Riot ID, for instance) for other defined purposes such as security and fraud detection.
As another example, communications logs/history data is retained at minimum for a period of time sufficient to allow any complaints to be filed after a match, and if such a complaint is filed, for a period of up to two years from their creation or a period of time sufficient to investigate the complaint.
This is to enable Riot to properly investigate infringements of our rules and policies such as fraud, cheating and disruptive behavior.
You can also limit the info you share with third parties, such as by choosing not to link your Riot Games account with third-party services (see Third-Party Websites and Services).
We offer players choices about the types of communications they receive from Riot Games.
If you choose to receive marketing and promotional emails from us but later change your mind, simply “unsubscribe” by following the instructions in the relevant email.
These choices don’t apply to mandatory communications that are part of the Riot Services, like important account-related notices.
The Riot Services also have many built-in tools to help players exercise control over their info directly.
For example, you can generally mute or disable voice or text communication functionality and change other preferences from your account settings.
If you need help with any of these options, be sure to Contact Us.
Many Internet browsers allow you to reject, manage, and delete cookies.
You may also be able to manage other similar technologies, like HTML5, by changing your browser settings (see Info We Collect Automatically).
If you don’t want to take advantage of the services that third-party analytics and advertising companies provide on the Riot Services, you may be able to opt out (or opt in if you are in the EU) of some of them by visiting YourAdChoices.

If you’re concerned with the way we’re handling your info, or if you would like to request to access, correct, update, restrict or delete your personal info, object to or opt out of the processing of your personal info, withdraw your consent to our use of your info, or if you would like to request a copy of your personal info for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent these rights are provided to you by applicable law), please Contact Us.
Your right to object includes where we process your info for direct marketing, for performing a task in the public interest or pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party.
You can also learn more about how to request access to your account info, or about how to delete your account.
You also have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights.
If you withdraw your consent (including for marketing purposes), it does not affect the lawfulness of what we did up until that point.
Before we process such requests, we may ask you to verify your identity (like by logging-in to your account or providing us with certain info to help us confirm ownership) and we may request payment where allowed by law.
Note that asking us to remove personal info or refrain from processing it may also result in account suspension or termination where this info is necessary to make Riot Services available to you (we normally tell you this at the point we collect the info), in which case you’ll no longer be able to access those Riot Services.
We may also retain certain info associated with your account for purposes like complying with our legal obligations, managing internal books and records, preventing fraud, resolving disputes, and enforcing our contracts and terms, such as this notice and the Terms of Service.
If you’re in the EEA/UK, you may lodge a complaint with an EU/UK/EEA data protection authority for your country or region where an alleged infringement of applicable data protection law occurs.
Riot Games lead supervisory authority under the GDPR is the Irish Data Protection Commission [dataprotection.
ie].
If you’re in Australia, please note that you generally have the right to deal with us anonymously or using a pseudonym (unless it’s not practicable for us to deal with you on this basis).
Also, please Contact Us if you would like to complain that we have breached the Australian Privacy Principles or any applicable code.

SECURITY.
Summary.
We’re committed to securing player info and complying with our obligations towards applicable data protection laws, but can’t absolutely guarantee the security of any data we collect from you.

Expand.
We use appropriate physical, technical, and organizational security safeguards to help protect your info from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure both during transmission and in storage.
For example, we use computer systems with limited access in controlled facilities to store info.
We also use technologies like encryption and hashing to protect some of the info we collect.
However, please note that no server, communications network, or data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.
The Riot Services are no exception.
We can’t guarantee the security of any info transmitted through the Riot Services and make no assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss or misuse.

When we do make changes, we’ll update the “Last Modified” date at the top of the notice and post it to the Riot Services.
If we make material changes to the notice or the ways we process player info, we’ll provide you additional notice as well (such as by prominently posting a notice of the changes on the Riot Services before they take effect or sending you a notification directly).
