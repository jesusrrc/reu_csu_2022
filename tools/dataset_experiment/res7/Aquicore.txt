How Do We Protect Your Information.
We will take reasonable precautions to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, alteration and destruction.
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Email Communications.
Our software does not encrypt email messages.
Email messages traveling through the Internet are subject to viewing, alteration, and copying by potentially anyone on the Internet.
Please keep in mind that transmitting information via email over the Internet is never completely secure and thus any information submitted may be intercepted, collected, used, or disclosed by others.
If you are concerned about the security of your communication(s), we encourage you to send your correspondence through the United States Postal Service or use the telephone to speak directly to us.
We are not responsible for the security or confidentiality of communications you send to us through the Internet using email messages.

However, non-personally identifiable user information may be provided to third parties as described in this Policy.
This Site is geared towards U.
S.
residents.
Given that the Internet operates in a global environment and that, if you operate outside of the United States, transfer of your data is necessary for you to use our Services or request information from us, using the Internet to collect and process your Personal Information necessarily involves the transmission of data on a cross-border basis to the United States.
By registering for the Site or accessing the Services, and/or communicating with us by email outside of the U.
S.
, you acknowledge and expressly consent to our processing, disclosure and transfer, including cross-border transfer, of your Personal Information in this way.
For users who are located outside the United States, Personal Information will be transferred to the United States where our servers are located and where it will be processed and stored.
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy in respect of such transfer, but will not otherwise take steps to ensure compliance with applicable laws in each user’s country of residence.
By registering for the Site, by accessing the Services and/or by emailing us, you expressly agree to such transfer and disclosure.
We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our Site policies, or protect our or other’s rights, property, or safety.
Because our servers, which store your information, are located in the U.
S.
A.
, your information may be available to U.
S.
government entities or agencies under a lawful court order in the U.
S.
