Use of Personal Information.

This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis so as to prevent identification of personal information relating to any one individual.
We may share the aggregated data with our business partners.
Legal Basis.
On what legal basis do we process personal information.

European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK) Data Protection Rights.
What about my rights under EEA & UK law.
Individuals whose personal information is collected and/or used in Europe have the rights described in our BCR-C’s.
The capitalized terms used in this section and not otherwise defined in this Statement have the same meaning as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
What are your rights in relation to Personal Data.
Subject to applicable law, you may have a number of rights regarding the Processing of your Personal Data, including.
The right to request access to, or copies of your Personal Data that we Process or control, together with information regarding the nature, processing and disclosure of those Personal Data.
The right to request rectification of any inaccuracies in your Personal Data that we Process or control.

Information Security.
What about information security.
When you place an order or provide personal information, we employ certain technical and organization security measures, such as encryption where appropriate.
Encryption scrambles the information in your purchase, including your credit card number, so this information can only be viewed by Motorola Solutions.
Motorola Solutions currently uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, where appropriate, for Internet-based transactions.
However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we have taken appropriate steps to protect your personal information, Motorola Solutions cannot ensure or otherwise warrant the security of any information you provide to us or from our Web site, and therefore you use our site at your own risk.
International Data Transfers.
Where will my personal information be transferred.
As a global company Motorola Solutions has international sites and users all over the world.
The personal information you provide may be transmitted, used, stored and otherwise processed outside of the country where you submitted that information, including jurisdictions that may not have data privacy laws that provide equivalent protection to such laws in your home country, including primarily the United States where our global headquarters is located.
Our BCR-C’s govern transfers between our group companies and require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“UK”) in accordance with applicable data protection law.
For all other personal information, we take steps designed to protect personal information in a similar manner.
We have implemented similar transfer safeguards, such as entering into the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, with our third party service providers and partners.
Further details can be provided upon request.
Retention.
For how long will Motorola Solutions keep my personal information.
We apply a general rule of keeping personal information only for as long as required to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.
However, if necessary, we may retain personal information for longer periods of time, until set retention periods and deadlines expire, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements, set by a legislator, regulator or supervisory authorities.
In specific circumstances we may retain your personal information until the statutory limitation periods have expired (usually three years, but up to thirty years in some cases), when this is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion or anonymization is possible.
Children's Privacy.
What about my child’s privacy.
Web sites and other online services operated by or on behalf of Motorola Solutions, Inc.
and its world-wide affiliated companies and subsidiaries are not intended for use by persons under the age of 13.
We do not seek to or knowingly collect or solicit information about children under the age of 13.
No information should be submitted to or posted on our web sites or other online services by users under 13 years of age.
If a child under the age of 13 provides personal information to us, we encourage the child’s parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the personal information from our systems.
If we learn that any personal information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete the information.
