We are therefore interested in showing you advertising that is of interest to you, to make our website more interesting for you and to achieve a fair calculation of advertising costs.
These advertising materials are delivered by Google via so-called “ad servers”.
For this purpose, we use ad server cookies, through which certain parameters for measuring success, such as the insertion of ads or clicks by users, can be measured.

These cookies enable Google to recognize your internet browser.
If a user visits certain pages of the website of an Ads customer and the cookie stored on their computer has not yet expired, Google and the customer can recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page.
A different cookie is assigned to each Ads customer.
Cookies cannot therefore be tracked via the websites of Ads customers.
We ourselves do not collect and process any personal data in the advertising measures mentioned.
We only receive statistical evaluations from Google.
Based on these evaluations, we can see which of the advertising measures used are particularly effective.
We do not receive any further data from the use of the advertising material, in particular we cannot identify the users based on this information.
