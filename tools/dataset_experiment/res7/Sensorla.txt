Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an AdWords customer.

Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page.
However, advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to personally identify users.
If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt out of this by disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie by changing your browser settings.
In doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.
