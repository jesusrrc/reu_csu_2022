Conflict Minerals StatementAcrosser Technology Co.
, Ltd.
(Acrosser) supports its customers’ and suppliers’ efforts to comply with section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
Conflict minerals have been identified as those originating from the "Conflict Region," which includes the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries that were outside of the supply chain prior to January 31, 2013.
The minerals in question are tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold.
Acrosser does not directly purchase these minerals from smelters or mines and will work closely with suppliers throughout its supply chain to produce evidence of compliance that minerals are procured only from smelters and refiners that have been found to be compliant with the Conflict-Free Smelter.
Acrosser is fully committed to fulfilling its obligations regarding Conflict Minerals and supports the humanitarian goals and objectives underlying the Dodd-Frank Act provisions and related rules to Conflict Minerals.
Acrosser will support its customers in their Conflict Minerals compliance efforts and is committed to undertaking initiatives that work towards a DRC Conflict Free supply chain.
Please contact us at telephone +886-2-2999-9000, or email us at for more information on our conflict minerals program.
Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy1.
Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights.
It takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labor, and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s 6 liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.
We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.
2.
We are also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to tackling modern slavery throughout our supply chains, consistent with our disclosure obligations under the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers, and other business partners, and as part of our contracting processes, we include specific prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory, or trafficked labor, or anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children, and we expect that our suppliers will hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.
3.
This policy applies to all persons working for us or on our behalf in any capacity, including employees at all levels, directors, officers, agency workers, seconded workers, volunteers, interns, agents, contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives, and business partners.
4.
This policy does not form part of any employee’s contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.
Gifts and Entertainment PolicyThe acceptance of gifts and entertainment by employees and directors or members of their family may present a conflict of interest.
While employees and directors are permitted to accept gifts of nominal value, they are prohibited from accepting anything that might influence their judgment on Company matters affecting the donor or that might be accompanied by any express or implied understanding that the recipient is in any way obligated to take some action which would benefit the donor to the detriment of the Company in exchange for the gift.
Similarly, employees may accept entertainment, but only insofar as it is reasonable in the context of the business at hand and facilitates the Company’s interests.
When practical and appropriate, hospitality should be reciprocated.
Employees are strictly prohibited from soliciting gifts, gratuities, or business courtesies for the benefit of any family member or friend.
Anti-bribery policy We define and understand bribery as the act of giving or promising financial or other advantages to induce an individual to make decisions that are unlawful, unethical, or that – more in general - they would not otherwise take under the circumstances.
Corruption is an abuse of a position of power to get an illicit advantage and includes, but is not limited to, bribery.
We also define bribery and corruption as active or passive, depending on whether the individual is on the giving or receiving end.
We reject any form of bribery and corruption - whether active or passive, public or private - not only because it is a crime, but also because it is completely against all ethical and sound business practices.
Members of the personnel or their families must not give or receive personal rewards when dealing with customers and suppliers, beyond what is considered reasonable within the normal business practice.
Any deviation from this code of conduct will not be tolerated.
Human Rights Policy and Statement Acrosser is committed to maintaining a corporate culture that respects the principles aimed at promoting, protecting, and supporting all internationally recognized human rights.
We recognize our responsibility to respect human rights and avoid complicity in human rights abuses.
ApplicabilityThe Company’s commitment to promoting human rights applies to all persons involved in the Company’s operations including, but not limited to, Company employees, officers, contractors, leased workers, suppliers, vendors, and customers.
In situations where Acrosser does not have overall control of operations, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that involved parties follow human rights principles similar to those stated herein.
PurposeRespect for human rights is a fundamental value of the Company.
Acrosser strives to respect and promote human rights in our relationships with our employees, customers, communities, indigenous communities, and other business stakeholders.
Modern Slavery StatementAlthough the Acrosser Technology is not required to make a modern slavery statement under section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act.
2015, we are making voluntary modern slavery and human trafficking statement to show our commitment to ethical trading principles and to set out the steps we are taking to tackle modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and in our supply chains.
Occupational Safety and Health ManagementAcrosser Technology set up a Employees' Welfare Committee according to the Organization Regulations on Employee Welfare Committee and provides employees regular corporate retreats, health checks, and occupational safety and health education and training.
