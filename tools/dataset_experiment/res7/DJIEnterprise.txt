Please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (e.
g.
, via fax or social media).
We will review the information provided and may request additional information to ensure we are interacting with the correct individual.
If you have an online account with us, you may be required to log-in to your account for identity verification.
If you do not have an account with us, additional information to verify your identity may be required by law before we may take action upon such a request.
This additional information may vary depending on the nature of your request and/or the nature of the information about which your request relates.
In some cases, we may also be required by law to obtain a signed declaration under penalty of perjury from you that you are the subject of the request being made.
If we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity on or from your account, we will delay taking action on your request until we can appropriately verify your identity and the request as authentic.
By law, we are not required to collect personal information that we otherwise would not collect in the ordinary course of our business, retain personal information for longer than we would otherwise retain such information in the ordinary course of our business, or re-identify or otherwise link information that is not maintained in a manner that would be considered personal information.
If we have not requested specific additional information from you to verify your request, please do not send such information.
We generally will aim to avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification.
However, if we cannot reasonably verify your identity or more information is needed for security or fraud-prevention purposes, we may consider any of the following factors, alone or in combination, in requesting additional information.
The type, sensitivity, and value of the personal information collected and maintained about the consumer, as applicable law requires a more stringent verification process for sensitive or valuable personal information.

If your request is regarding household information, the same verification steps above are required before we can provide you with aggregate household information.
For us to process a request for access to or deletion of specific pieces of information regarding your household, all members of the household must make the request, and we must be able to verify each household member.
In some cases, we may not have sufficient information about you or your household to be able to verify your identity or sufficiently differentiate you from another consumer or household to the degree of certainty required by law, in which case, we will not be able to act upon your request.
In such cases, it may be unlikely that we would be able to identify you or your household in the future without collecting significantly more information or seeking to re-identify de-identified information.
At this time, we do not intend to take such steps in response to a request made pursuant to this Privacy Policy and applicable law does not require that we do so.
If, in the future, we determine a reasonable method to identify you or your household absent such steps, we will provide an update to you through this Privacy Policy and in response to any such request at that time.
Information that you submit for the purpose of allowing us to verify your identity in furtherance of a consumer-related or household-related request pursuant to California law will only be used by us, and our service providers if any, for that purpose and no other.
Except where we are required by law to maintain such information for record-keeping purposes, we will take steps to delete any new personal information collected for the purpose of verification as soon as practical after processing your request.
Please also be aware that making any such request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal or deletion of Personal Information or content you may have posted, and there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow us to fulfill your request, including, for example, where fulfilling your request may infringe upon the rights and freedoms of other consumers.
We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee or take other appropriate action in response to requests from a consumer or household that are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character.
You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf pursuant to applicable law.
We accept documentation of your designation in the form of a valid power of attorney and/or a notarized statement.
You must submit evidence of your designation of an authorized agent in writing to.
