3 Web analysis and optimization.
We use web analysis and range measurement tools to enable us to evaluate the streams of visitors viewing our website.
For this purpose, we collect information about the behaviour, interests or demographic information of visitors, for instance their age, gender or similar.
This helps us to recognise the times at which our website and its functions or content are most frequently used or to invite users to visit our site again.
We can also use the collected information to determine whether our website needs to be optimised or adapted.
The information collected for this purpose is stored in cookies or similar processes and used for range measurement and optimisation.
The data stored in the cookies may include viewed content, visited websites, settings and any functions and systems used.
However, no clear user data is regularly processed for the purposes described.
If clear data is processed, the data will be changed in such a way that the actual identity of the user is not known to us, nor does the provider of the tool used know the actual identity of the visitor.
The changed data is often saved in user profiles.

4 Online marketing.
We process personal data as part of online marketing to continuously increase our reach and awareness of our website.
In particular, we process this data with regard to potential interests and to measure the effectiveness of our marketing measures.
Relevant information is stored in cookies or similar processes for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of our marketing measures and identifying potential interests.
The data stored in the cookies may include viewed content, visited websites, settings and any functions and systems used.
However, no clear user data is regularly processed for the purposes described.
The data is then changed in such a way that the actual identity of the user is not known to us, nor does the provider of the tool used know the actual identity of the visitor.
The changed data is often saved in user profiles.
If user profiles are stored, the data can be read out, supplemented and added to the server of the online marketing tool when the user visits other websites that use the same online marketing tool.
We can determine the success of our advertisements based on summarised data made available to us by the provider of the online marketing tool (known as conversion measurement).
As part of these conversion measurements, we can track whether a marketing measure has led to a visitor of our website making a purchase decision.
This evaluation serves to analyse the success of our online marketing.

Our newsletters are designed to enable us to gain insights into improvements, target groups or the reading behaviour of our subscribers.
This enables us to use a web beacon or tracking pixel that reacts to interactions with the newsletter.
It informs us, for example, whether links are clicked, whether the newsletter is opened at all or at what time the newsletter is read.
We can assign this information to individual subscribers for technical reasons.
