The security of your personal information is very important to us.
We take all reasonable and appropriate measures to guard against accidental, unauthorized or unlawful loss, access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of your Personal Information, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.
We use industry-standard security measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of any Personal Information we own or process on behalf of our customers and visitors, including, in appropriate circumstances, the use of firewalls, restricted access and encrypted transmissions.
We limit access to Personal Information to those persons in our organization who have a business need to process such Personal Information.
Additionally, Swrve requires any sub-processers that it may use to adhere to the foregoing security measures.
Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Information, any transmission is at your own risk and we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site.
If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting by any means set out in the How Can I Contact Swrve.
section below.

How Does the Swrve Service Use My Personal Information.
The Swrve Service may be used by Swrve customers without providing Swrve with any Personal Information regarding end users of its applications (the “End User PII”).
However, in the event a Swrve customer wants to personalize the experience of the end users of its applications using the Swrve Service or use certain features, some End User PII may be processed through the Swrve Service.
End User PII is collected directly by the Swrve customer, not by Swrve, and therefore is controlled by the customer’s privacy policy, including the ways in which a Swrve customer may use End User PII on our platform.
In such cases, Swrve processes End User PII according to the limited and specified purpose of fulfilling instructions of its customers (as a Data Processor).
Swrve does not control a customer’s use of its End User PII, and is not responsible for the behavior of its customers.
We do not review, comment upon, or monitor our customers’ compliance with their respective privacy policies, nor do we review customer instructions to determine whether they are in compliance or conflict with the terms of a customer’s published privacy policy.
However, in the event we determine that we cannot process End User PII according to the appropriate level of protection, we will notify the customer and stop processing such End User PII.
