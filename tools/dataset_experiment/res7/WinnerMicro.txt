Pixel Tags.
We and our service providers may also use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") in connection with our website pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, track the actions of website users and email recipients, to determine the success of marketing campaigns and to compile aggregate statistics about website usage and response rates.
A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to website visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors' hard drives.
Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of our websites, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.

We take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this Policy is processed according to the provisions of this Policy and the requirements of applicable law.
We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection.
For example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints.

As further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, binding arbitration is available to address residual complaints not resolved by other means.
Security.
We seek to have security measures and tools (such as firewalls, digital SSL certificates, intrusion detection systems, and database encryption) in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

You acknowledge and agree that any information you transmit through our websites or upload for storage in connection with our websites is so transmitted or stored at your own risk.

, 5th Floor, Pittsburgh, PA 15237, Attention.
Privacy (note however that if you choose to notify us via physical mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem).
