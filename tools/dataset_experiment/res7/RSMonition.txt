With whom does RS share my information.
The company named on this site is a distributor of RS for your country, and RS operates this site on behalf of that distributor.

What does RS do to protect your personal data online.
In order to ensure the security and protection of your personal details whenever you submit any sensitive information such as credit card number and account details, we use 128 bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption - the latest technology to encode and protect your data - which is your guarantee for a safe and secure transaction.
The RS VeriSign Security Guarantee pops up whenever you submit sensitive information as an indication that the current information will be encrypted.
This means that your information is protected and safe to submit.
Sensitive credit card information stored on our in-house systems is also held in encrypted format.
Note.
If you rely upon the graphical indication on your browser screen (such as the padlock icon in Internet Explorer) this may not always indicate that a secure communication is taking place.
This is because RS Online uses frames to display certain information and the security icon may not always detect that a secure connection has been established in another frame.
What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information.
Your RS Online Account Information and RS Online Personal Profile are password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information.
