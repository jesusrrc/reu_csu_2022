Q.
Do you share personal information with any other parties, and if so, who.
A.
We understand “personal information” broadly.
customer name & address, payment information, and account activity like volume of data transferred, to be sure.
but also identifiers like IP addresses, MAC addresses, and anything else that, when added to what many third parties already know, could identify you personally.
We do not share personal information with anyone outside the All Telecom Korea Companies where we can avoid it.
However, there are contractual, court-ordered, and emergency circumstances when we have to do so.
When we do, we limit it to the information required in the circumstances, inform you where allowed, provide it only for the purpose stipulated, and make it subject to strict terms of confidentiality.
When a court orders us to provide personal information, we tell you about it unless we have been ordered by law not to.
Third parties to whom we provide personal information, and are held to the above standards, include.
Service providers acting on behalf of a All Telecom Korea  Company.
This, notably, includes wholesale network access providers.
But it may also include other service providers.
those hired to perform installation or maintenance on our behalf.
a collection agency, for the express purpose of collecting past due bills.
an emergency services provider (9-1-1).
Other communications service providers, to offer efficient and effective communications services.
For instance, we participate in CRTC-mandated number portability and other activities which require providing clearly-identified information elements to your new provider.
Where required by law, such as by court order or warrant.
in exigent circumstances, where the law would have required it were there time.
and for internal security matters.
These have almost always been law enforcement or emergency services, but from time to time, third parties have gone to court to seek pre-trial “Norwich Orders” compelling us to provide information in our possession.
Where they have, we have always insisted on providing our end-users with as much notice as is feasible in order to give them the opportunity to oppose such motions.
Third parties to whom we may have to provide personal information include.
An agent acting on behalf any one of the All Telecom Korea Companies, such as an entity hired to perform installation or maintenance on our behalf.
Another communications service provider, in order to offer efficient and effective communications services (e.
g.

A collection agency, for the express purpose of the collection of past due bills.
Law enforcement agencies, in emergencies, for internal security matters, or where required by court order or search warrant.

In all cases, information is retained in secure facilities, protected from unauthorized access and kept only as long as is reasonably required.
For example, our electronic files are backed up for redundancy, password protected and accessible only by authorized employees, on a need-to-know basis.
Q.
How long does All Telecom Korea store IP address log information.
A.
Log information remains within the database system for 30 days after a session is terminated.
We have no purpose for that information beyond that point, so it is automatically deleted, on a rolling basis.
However, end-users have the ability to maintain a single session indefinitely through persistent use.
IP address log information is only deleted 30 days after the session has ended, whether through inactivity, the most common reason a session ends.
a modem power-cycle.
or some other external event.
In isolated cases, we are required to extract certain information from that system in order to preserve it for longer than 30 days.
Occasionally we are required to do this by a court order in a criminal matter, but the most common reason for a mandated longer preservation period is to comply with the Copyright Act.
Since January 2, 2015, we have been required to forward notices of claimed copyright infringement to the account information that matches the IP address and timestamp indicated on the notice.
When we do so, we are also required to retain that IP-address-to-account correlation information, and the associated accountholder’s identity, for six months.
If the copyright owner who sent the notice commences court proceedings, we may be required to retain it for more than six months.
