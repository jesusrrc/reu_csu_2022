Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking.
This website uses Google AdWords.
AdWords is an online advertising program of Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States ("Google").
In the context of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking.
When you click on an ad served by Google, a cookie is set for conversion tracking.

These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used to personally identify users.
If the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not expired, Google and we may recognise that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to that page.
Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie.
The cookies cannot be tracked on the websites of AdWords customers.
The information collected using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted in to conversion tracking.
Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag.
However, you will not receive information that can be used to identify users personally.
If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this use by slightly disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie on your web browser under User Preferences.

on some websites.
Hotjar Ltd.
is a European company based in Malta (Hotjar Ltd, Level 2, St Julians Business Centre, 3, Elia Zammit Street, St Julians STJ 1000, Malta, Europe).
With this tool, movements on the websites where Hotjar is used can be traced (so-called heat maps).
For example, you can see how far users scroll and which buttons users click on how often.
Furthermore, the tool also allows you to obtain feedback directly from the users of the website.
In this way, we obtain valuable information to make our websites even faster and more customer-friendly.
The securatek GmbH & Co.
KG pays particular attention to the protection of your data when using this tool.
So we can only understand which buttons are clicked, the course of the mouse, how far it scrolls, the screen size of the device, device type and browser information, geographic location (country only) and the preferred language to display our website.
Areas of the websites in which personal data of you or third parties are displayed are automatically hidden by Hotjar and can therefore not be traced at any time.
Hotjar offers each user the possibility of preventing the use of the Hotjar tool by means of a "Do Not Track" header so that no data about the visit of the respective website is recorded.
This is a setting that all common browsers support in current versions.
For this purpose, your browser sends a request to Hotjar with the information to deactivate the tracking of the respective user.
If you use sipgate websites with different browsers/computers, you will need to set up the "Do Not Track Header" for each of these browsers/computers separately.
You can find detailed instructions with information about your browser at.
