More detailed information on Belden’s data retention programs may be provided upon receipt of an appropriate request.

In some instances, our use of your personal information may result in automated decisions being taken that legally affect you or similarly significantly affect you.

130(a)(5)(c), 1798.
130(c), and 1798.
140 indicate that organizations should disclose whether certain categories of personal  information are collected, “sold” or transferred for an organization’s “business purpose”(as those terms are defined under California law).
You can find a list of the categories of information that we collect and share here.

If you would like more information concerning the categories of personal information (if any) we share with third parties or affiliates for those parties to use for direct marketing, you can submit a request using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.
We do not discriminate against California residents who exercise any of their rights described in this Privacy Notice.
Modifications to Our Privacy Notice.
Belden reserves the right to change our Privacy Notice at any time, except as may be prohibited by law.
We will post revisions online and note the effective date of the latest version at the bottom of the Privacy Notice.
To the extent that our policy changes in a material way, the Privacy Notice that was in place at the time that you submitted personal information to us will generally govern that information unless we receive your consent to the new Privacy Notice.
Privacy Shield Provisions.
From the period shortly after its inception through April 1, 2021, Belden participated in both the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Programs.
In 2020, the Privacy Shield Program was invalidated by European Data Protection Authorities as a mechanism through which the transfer of data to the United States is permitted.
As a result, Belden elected not to renew its certifications on April 1, 2021.
We are actively monitoring developments in this area as U.
S.
and European regulators attempt to devise a satisfactory replacement framework and Belden will look forward to a new cooperative data sharing framework in the future.
Even though Belden Inc.
and its subsidiaries are no longer a part of the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield programs, we remain committed to the principles enshrined in each program.
We have always taken, and we will continue to take, the privacy of our associates, partners and other stakeholders very seriously and will continue to take appropriate steps to protect your personal information.
As disclosed above, Belden may share Personal Data with third parties that provide certain services to Belden, including but not limited to, outside accountants and lawyers, consultants and service providers.
Prior to transferring Personal Data within the Belden Group, Belden will ensure that the protection and transfer of such Personal Data complies with appropriate data protection and privacy principles.
Belden may transfer Personal Data to a third party acting as an agent for Belden by having the third party enter into an agreement with Belden in which the third party promises to provide appropriate safeguards regarding the protection of your Personal Data.
If the third party agent does not comply with its privacy obligations, Belden will take commercially reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure of Personal Data.
Belden acknowledges that it remains potentially liable under the Privacy Shield Principles for the actions of its agents.
Belden may also transfer Personal Data to a third party without your consent in response to requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, including, for example, if we are required to do so by law, regulation, subpoena, court order or any other government, judicial or regulatory process.
