Note on data transfer to the USA and other third countries.
Among other things, we use tools from companies based in the USA or other third countries that are not secure under data protection law.
If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to these third countries and processed there.
We would like to point out that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these countries.
For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take legal action against this.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that U.
S.
authorities (e.
g.
intelligence agencies) may process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on U.
S.
servers for monitoring purposes.
We have no influence on these processing activities.
Revocation of your consent to data processing.
Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent.
You can revoke consent you have already given at any time.
The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 21(1) DSGVO).
IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING.
THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING.
IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 (2) DSGVO).
Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority.
In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right of appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged violation.
The right of appeal is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.
Right to data portability.
You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in performance of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format.
If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.
SSL or TLS encryption.
For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or requests that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption.

For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.
If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art.
21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your and our interests must be carried out.
As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.

Newsletter data.
If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require an e-mail address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified e-mail address and agree to receive the newsletter.
Further data is not collected or only on a voluntary basis.
For the handling of the newsletter, we use newsletter service providers, which are described below.
MailChimp.
This website uses the services of MailChimp for sending newsletters.
The provider is Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.
MailChimp is a service with which, among other things, the sending of newsletters can be organized and analyzed.
When you enter data for the purpose of receiving newsletters (e.
g.
e-mail address), this data is stored on MailChimp's servers in the USA.
With the help of MailChimp, we can analyze our newsletter campaigns.
When you open an email sent with MailChimp, a file contained in the email (so-called web-beacon) connects to the servers of MailChimp in the USA.
This makes it possible to determine whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links, if any, have been clicked.
In addition, technical information is recorded (e.
g.
time of retrieval, IP address, browser type and operating system).
This information cannot be assigned to the respective newsletter recipient.
It is used exclusively for the statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns.
The results of these analyses can be used to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients.
If you do not want any analysis by MailChimp, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter.
For this purpose, we provide a corresponding link in every newsletter message.
The data processing is based on your consent (Art.
6 para.
1 lit.
a DSGVO).
You can revoke this consent at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter.
The legality of the data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.
The data you have provided to us for the purpose of receiving the newsletter will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter.
Data that has been stored by us for other purposes remains unaffected by this.
Data transfer to the USA is based on the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission.
Details can be found here.

com/legal/data-processing-addendum/.
After you have unsubscribed from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist if necessary to prevent future mailings.
The data from the blacklist will only be used for this purpose and will not be merged with other data.
This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art.
6 (1) f DSGVO).
The storage in the blacklist is not limited in time.
You can object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.

Handling of applicant data.
We offer you the opportunity to apply to us (e.
g.
by e-mail, by post or via online application form).
In the following, we inform you about the scope, purpose and use of your personal data collected during the application process.
We assure you that the collection, processing and use of your data will be carried out in accordance with applicable data protection law and all other statutory provisions and that your data will be treated in strict confidence.
Scope and purpose of data collection.
When you send us an application, we process your associated personal data (e.
g.
contact and communication data, application documents, notes taken during interviews, etc.
) to the extent necessary to decide whether to establish an employment relationship.
The legal basis for this is Section 26 BDSG under German law (initiation of an employment relationship), Article 6 (1) (b) DSGVO (general contract initiation) and - if you have given your consent - Article 6 (1) (a) DSGVO.
The consent can be revoked at any time.
Your personal data will only be passed on within our company to persons involved in processing your application.
If the application is successful, the data you submitted will be stored in our data processing systems on the basis of Section 26 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and Article 6 (1) lit.
b DSGVO for the purpose of implementing the employment relationship.
Retention period of the data.
If we are unable to make you a job offer, if you reject a job offer or if you withdraw your application, we reserve the right to store the data you have submitted with us on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art.
6 (1) (f) DSGVO) for up to 6 months from the end of the application process (rejection or withdrawal of the application).
The data will then be deleted and the physical application documents destroyed.
This storage serves in particular as evidence in the event of a legal dispute.
If it is apparent that the data will be required after the 6-month period has expired (e.
g.
due to an impending or pending legal dispute), the data will not be deleted until the purpose for continued storage no longer applies.
Longer storage may also take place if you have given your corresponding consent (Art.
6 (1) a DSGVO) or if legal storage obligations prevent deletion.
Inclusion in the applicant pool.
If we do not make you a job offer, it may be possible to include you in our applicant pool.
If you are accepted, all documents and information from your application will be transferred to the applicant pool so that we can contact you in the event of suitable vacancies.
Inclusion in the applicant pool takes place exclusively on the basis of your express consent (Art.
6 para.
1 lit.
a DSGVO).

This includes in particular IP addresses, MAC addresses, device IDs, device type, operating system type and version, client version, camera type, microphone or speaker, and the type of connection.
