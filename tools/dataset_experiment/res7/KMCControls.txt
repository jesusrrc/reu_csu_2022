Please see the section toward the end of this Privacy Policy.
Personal Information does not include your personally identifiable information that has been deidentified, pseudonymized, anonymized, aggregated and/or otherwise processed so as to be unidentifiable in such a way that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific individual (by reasonable means) without the use of additional information, and where such additional information is kept separate and under adequate security to prevent unauthorized re-identification of a specific individual such that one could not, using reasonable efforts, link such information back to a specific individual (the foregoing in this sentence being referred to as “De-Identified Personal Information”).
This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect.

The Privacy Policy does not apply to Personal Information about you that we receive from other sources.
However, we may combine the information received from these other sources with Personal Information collected through this Website.
In those cases, we will apply the Privacy Policy to the combined information, unless specifically disclosed otherwise.
Other than as stated herein, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries), including through any application or content that may link to or be accessible from or on our website.

Certain features of our Website may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our Website.
Local storage cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies.
Web Beacons.
Pages of our Website and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).
Pixel Tracking.
In addition to using Cookies, the Website may employ “pixel tracking”, a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on other sites.
Pixel tracking involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user and consist of a few lines of computer code.
Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics.
A “pixel tag” is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites that is used to track an individual user’s activity.
We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our goods, services, and other offers with your interests and needs.
For example, if you visit our Website from an advertisement on another website, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that its advertisement brought you to the Website.
If you visit our Website, and we link you to another website, we may also be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third-party website.
This data is collected for use in our marketing and research.
GIF.

IP Address.
Our servers automatically record certain log file information reported from your browser when you access the Services.
These server logs may include information such as which pages of the Service you visited, your internet protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, and other information on how you interact with the Services.
These log files are generally deleted periodically.
