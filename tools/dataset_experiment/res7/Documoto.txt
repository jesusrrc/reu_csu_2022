Last Updated.
April 25, 2022.
At Documoto, we take your privacy seriously.
This Policy describes how we collect, use, process, and disclose personally identifiable information that we gather about you.
This information comes from our primary website  and other sites we use from time to time such as support.
documoto.
com (“Websites”).
from usage of the Documoto Web Application and Software through web browsers, APIs, and the Documobile application (“Services”).
and from your interactions with Documoto personnel through phone calls, emails, and other methods.
This Policy also outlines your rights and choices with regard to the information collected about you.
This policy applies to all visitors to our website, to all users of our Services, whether or not you are a paying customer, and to all other individuals that have interactions with Documoto, Inc.
When you use our Services, access our Websites, or contact Documoto personnel, you are accepting the terms, conditions and practices within this Policy.
For EU Residents, this Policy is intended to comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact us at .
Information We Collect About You.

Our Services are used by customers and their designated users to create, distribute, and share information (“Content”) from a variety of sources.
While principally technical in nature, this Content may include personal information about you, obtained by our customers or provided by you through provisioning the Services, through Services features such as comments, transactional activities such as shopping cart and order submittals, and other means.
All Content, including your login information under the customer’s account, is owned by our customers, and Documoto has no control over this Content.
As a provider of the Services, acting under the direction of our customers, Documoto is acting in the role of a “Processor” (as defined by the GDPR) for all Content managed by the Services.
Accordingly, the customer’s privacy policy, not this privacy policy, applies to information of which we are a processor.
Other Information.
Documoto collects data about you through your interactions with our Websites, through your interactions with our Services, and through your interactions with Documoto personnel.

Information Others May Provide.
