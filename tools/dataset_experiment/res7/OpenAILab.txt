The information we collect and how we use it.
We collect Your Information when you provide it to us when you register with us (if you are an API Customer), when you use the API, or when you access the Site.
Our primary purposes for collecting Your Information are to enable us to provide you with API services, to help ensure the quality of our services, to improve products and services of OpenAI and its affiliates, and ensure compliance with our Terms of Use.
More specifically.
Registration Data (API Customers only1)—The information you give us when you create an account includes your name, e-mail address, and whatever additional information you choose to provide (which might include your mailing information and phone number).
As part of the registration process, you will need to create a password for authentication purposes, which is stored not with us but with the service provider we use to store user passwords securely and to authenticate them when you seek to use the API.
We use the information you provide to establish and maintain your account, to deliver to you the services you request, to provide related customer service, to ensure quality, to send you email updates and otherwise communicate with you, to facilitate your use of the API and to improve products and services of OpenAI and its affiliates.
Data Submitted through the API (API Customers & End Users)—We store and process any data you chose to submit through the API in order to provide you with our API services.
We may also use that data to ensure quality, secure and improve the API (and any related software, models, and algorithms), and to detect and prevent misuse.

In addition to processing submitted data to generate output for you, other ways we may use such data include.
Spot checks and analysis to detect bias or offensive content and improve ways to reduce such occurrences.
Large scale analysis of anonymized submissions and completions to generally improve the API and underlying models.
Train and refine semantic search models to improve our search capabilities.
Train and refine classifier models to identify such things as bias, sentiment, and the like.
Train and refine aligned models (e.
g.
, the instruct series models) to generally improve future versions of the models.
andAnalysis to troubleshoot technical issues.
How we do not use it.
