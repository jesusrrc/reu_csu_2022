Privacy Policy.
Last Updated.
May 11, 2022.
HelpSystems is committed to protecting your privacy.
This Statement of Privacy (“Statement”) governs the data collection, processing, and usage practices of HelpSystems on its Website, the websites of its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “Website”) and in the other contexts outlined below.
In many cases, HelpSystems shares the various categories of personal information identified below with its affiliate and subsidiaries for a variety of purposes (as outlined below).
By using the Website and/or otherwise engaging with HelpSystems as described herein, you consent to the data practices described in this Statement.
Website Collection, Use Practices and Purposes.
We process personal information for a variety of reasons and we have set out below a description of various ways we may collect and use your personal data and the corresponding legal bases we rely on.
Information that you provide voluntarily.
We have a legitimate interest in receiving and processing your requests, administering our business activities, and providing customer service.
We also have a legitimate interest to use aspects of your data collected in this manner in order to improve our products, services and customer experience, and/or to draw from such communications for statistical and/or reference purposes.
When you participate in a survey or contest, we collect information that you provide through the survey.
If the survey is provided by a third-party service provider, the third-party’s privacy policy applies to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information.
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose additional information that may be requested.
Information requested via surveys and contests may include additional demographic information.
Information that we obtain from third-party sources.
From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from other sources, including third-parties, business partners, our affiliates, or publicly available sources.
The types of information we collect from third-parties may include marketing information provided by trade shows and professional and other relevant information available to us on social networks.
We have a legitimate interest to use the information we receive from these third-parties to allow us to make more informed decisions, improve the accuracy of records we hold, and occasionally to reach out to you regarding items or issues we believe interest you.
In addition to the purposes and uses described above, we may use personal information in the following ways.
to identify you when you visit our Website.
to provide products and services (“Services”).
to provide access to our Services.
to improve our services and product offerings.
to conduct analytics.
to verify the accuracy of data that we hold about you.
to manage the security of your information and our network and, more specifically, in relation to any steps we may take to protect your information against loss, damage, theft or unauthorized access or disclosure.
for the prevention of fraud and other criminal activities.
for the establishment and defense of our legal rights.
to respond to inquiries related to support, or other requests and more generally correspond or communicate with you.
to send marketing and promotional materials, including information relating to our Services, sales, or promotions.
for internal administrative purposes, as well as to manage our relationships.
and.
for other purposes that are not incompatible with the purposes we have disclosed to you (such as archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes) if and where this is permitted by applicable data protection laws.
Although the sections above describe our primary purpose in collecting and using your personal information, in many situations we have more than one purpose.
For example, if you complete an online purchase, we may collect your information to perform our contract with you, but we also collect your information as we have a legitimate interest in maintaining your information after your transaction is complete so that we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your order.
As a result, our collection and processing of your information is based in different contexts upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law, and/or our legitimate interest in conducting our business.
Social Media (Features) and Widgets.
Our Website includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, “Share This” button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our Website.
These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Website.
Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Links to Other Websites.
Our Website includes links to other website(s) whose privacy practices may differ from those of HelpSystems.
If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements.
We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website(s) you visit.
Testimonials.
With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name.
Public Forums and Comment Sections.
Our Website offers publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums.
Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through HelpSystems public message boards, blogs, or forums, this information may be collected and used by others.
Note.
HelpSystems does not share your private online communications with others.
Opt Out of Use of Personal Information and Unsubscribe.
You can withdraw your consent to use of your personally identifiable information at any time but withdrawing your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any communications HelpSystems has sent to you before your consent was withdrawn.

HelpSystems does not sell, rent, or lease its customer lists to third-parties in which we do not have a formal agreement to provide services to HelpSystems and our customers or prospects.
HelpSystems may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you.
In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (email, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third-party.
In addition, HelpSystems may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries or contact you based on your interest to receive such communications.

Such third-parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to HelpSystems, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
If the third-party agent does not comply with its privacy obligations, we will take commercially reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure of your personal information.

Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.
These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
Specifically, certain website assets and our corporate headquarters are located in the United States, and our group companies and third-party service providers and partners operate around the world.

Automated decisions mean that a decision concerning you is made automatically on the basis of a computer determination (using software algorithms), without human review.
When we make an automated decision about you, you have the right to contest the decision, to express your point of view, and to require a human review of the decision.
You can exercise this right by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “Contact Information” heading below.
