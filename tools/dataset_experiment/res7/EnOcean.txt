Our social media appearances.
Data processing through social networks.
We maintain publicly available profiles in social networks.
The individual social networks we use can be found below.
Social networks such as Facebook, Google+ etc.
can generally analyse your user behaviour comprehensively if you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.
g.
like buttons or banner ads).
When you visit our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant processing operations are triggered.
In detail.
If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media page, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account.
Under certain circumstances, your personal data may also be recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal.
In this case, this data is collected, for example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.
Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which their preferences and interests are stored.
This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and outside of your social media presence.
If you have an account with the social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on any device you are logged in to or have logged in to.
Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the social media portals.
Depending on the provider, additional processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media portals.
Details can be found in the terms of use and privacy policy of the respective social media portals.
