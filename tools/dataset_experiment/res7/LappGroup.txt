We use cookies for the following purposes (the individual cookies are described below in detail).
Absolutely necessary cookies, these are necessary for the function of the site, for example for the allocation of a shopping cart.
They cannot be deactivated in your systems.
As a rule, these cookies are only set in response to actions taken by you that correspond to a service request, such as updating your privacy settings, logging in or filling out forms.
You can set your browser to block these cookies or to notify you about these cookies.
However, some areas of the website may not function properly without them.
Performance cookies are used to determine how well the site performs on different browsers and to determine if there are any problems with load times.
This enables us to make technical improvements to the website.
These cookies enable us to count visits and traffic sources so that we can measure and improve the performance of our website.
They also help us to answer questions concerning which pages are most popular, which are least used and how visitors navigate on the website.
All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and is therefore at least pseudonymous.

6 (1) lit.
f.
GDPR are stored for 7 days.
This is done for our security in case someone leaves unlawful content in comments and posts (insults, prohibited political propaganda, etc.
).
In this case, we ourselves can be prosecuted for the comment or post and are therefore interested in the identity of the author.
Sec.
5 Objection or revocation against processing of your data.
(1) If you have granted your consent to the processing of your data, you may revoke your consent at any time.
Such revocation will impact the processing admissibility of your personal data after stating it.
(2) You may object against the processing inasmuch as we base the processing of personal data on a balance of interests.
This would be the case if processing is not required to fulfill a contract with you.
this is outlined in detail in the following description of functions.
On objecting we would request a statement of reasons as to why our company may not process personal data as usual.
In the event of your justified objection, we shall look into the matter and will either terminate or adjust data processing, or explain to you our compelling and legitimate grounds as to why processing will be continued.

6 Service providers.
hosting and operation of the website, technical service providers.
In the context of contract processing, the data is stored on the servers of Lapp Service GmbH.
Sec.
7 Website optimization econda.
For the demand-oriented design and optimization of this website, solutions and technologies of econda GmbH (econda GmbHZimmerstr.
6, 76137 Karlsruhe,  collects and stores pseudonymised data and creates user profiles from this data using pseudonyms.
econda anonymises the data already at the time of collection by shortening the IP address, therefore if used as intended it is not possible for econda to assign the data to a specific user.
The anonymized data remains on the econda servers (only in Germany) and can only be viewed there by us.
This aggregated data enables us to analyse e.
g.
visitor flows and click paths without being able to assign them to a specific user.
For this purpose, cookies can be used which enable the recognition of an Internet browser.
However, user profiles are not merged with data on the bearer of the pseudonym without the visitor’s express consent.
In particular, IP addresses are rendered unrecognisable immediately after receipt, which makes it impossible to assign user profiles to IP addresses.
Visitors to this website can object to this data collection and storage for the future at any time here.
The data is stored for a period of ten years.
You can find out more about econda’s data protection under this link.

Sec.
8 Storage period of personal data.
Unless stated to the contrary, the criterion decisive for our stipulating of storage periods is the respective statutory safekeeping period.
Data are deleted after such period has expired, provided they are no longer needed for contract performance or contract initiation.
Sec.
9 Legal or contractual rules on the provision of personal data.
The provision of personal data is partly prescribed by law, e.
g.
tax regulations, or may be the result of contractual arrangements (e.
g.
statements concerning a contractual party).
When signing a contract it may sometimes be necessary for data subjects to place their personal data at our disposal which, at a later stage, need to be processed by our company.
For example, the data subject may be under obligation to make personal data available to us when our company signs a contract with them.
A consequence of non-provision of personal data would be that no contract might be signed with the data subject.
Data subjects must contact a member of our staff prior to such person making personal data available.
In every individual case, our employee will advise data subjects if the provision of personal data is legally or contractually prescribed or required for signing a contract.
He will also inform on possibly existing obligations to provide personal data and possible consequences of not providing personal data.
Sec.
10 Automated decision-making.
There will be no automated decision-making or profiling.
Sec.
11 Legal basis as per art.
6 (I) lit.
f GDPR, our legitimate interests in processing.
Processing procedures may ultimately be based on art.
6 (I) lit.
f GDPR.
Processing procedures not captured by any of the legal principles stated in Sec.
14 rest on this legal basis, if the processing is required to protect a legitimate interest of our company or of a third party, providing the interest, fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects do not prevail.
A legitimate interest could be assumed, if the data subject is a customer of the person responsible (Recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR).
If the processing of any personal data takes place on the basis of art.
6 (1) lit.
f GDPR, our legitimate interest will be the performance of our business activity.
Sec.
12 Further information.
The customer is aware that, in light of the current state of technology, no full data protection can yet be guaranteed in data transmissions via internet.
As a result, and in terms of security of any data posted on the internet, the client takes full responsibility.
For this reason, data subjects are at liberty to transmit their data to us via alternative options, e.
g.
per telephone.
