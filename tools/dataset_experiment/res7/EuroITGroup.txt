We’re protecting your information.
We are committed to your upholding your privacy and protecting the information that we have.
So we describe how we collect, use, and share your personal information.
Privacy and data protection are ever changing and enhancing the rights of individuals.
As such, we review how we use personal information, and we may update this privacy notice from time to time to reflect changes in applicable laws or the way we use your personal information.
The privacy notice displayed on this page is always the most up to date version.
We would encourage you to re-visit our privacy notice from time to time so that you are aware of any relevant updates we have made.
What do we mean by personal information.
In recent years, the most widely talked about data protection law was the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, also known as the GDPR.
The UK adopted the GDPR into UK law and it’s commonly known as the UK GDPR.
As you’ll see below, the definition of personal information is quite broad, and we recognise and respect personal information, defined as.
-.
“any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject').
an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.
How do we categorise information.
To help explain the different types of information we use, we use categories.
Now, it’s worth pointing out that we only collect personal information that is appropriate and lawful, and we comply with data protection legislation around the world, and there may be locations where we are not permitted to collect the types of information we’ve listed below.
But in general terms, this describes the categories we use.
Identity information.
Information specifically related to your identity which includes, your full name, marital status, title, date of birth, national insurance details and other recognised official identity documents.
Contact information.
The contact information of you and others, including, email addresses and telephone numbers, postal address details and social media handles.
Technical data.
In this technical age there is quite a bit of technical data around, including internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.
With your permission, we’ll collect information about how you use our website.
Marketing and communications data.
We’d like to develop lasting relationships and to help with this we collect information about your marketing preferences.
But don’t worry, we’re not interested in bombarding you with marketing content, just timely and relevant information about services and products we care about and that we think are relevant to you.
We put you in control, so you always have the option to decline this or opt out at any point.
Special categories of personal information.
Specifically, through our Global Careers portal, for the purpose of employment and assessing the working capabilities of our employees, we may process special category personal information.
There may be instances where other special categories of personal information are disclosed to us, but this is incidental and not part of an organised processing activity.

There may be instances where we process criminal record checks, but this is only done where necessary, aligned to local laws and is strictly limited to specific people in our teams.
