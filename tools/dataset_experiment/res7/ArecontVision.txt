AV Costar ("us", "we", or "our") operates the  website (the "Service").
This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service.
Your use of the Service indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and agreement to abide by its terms.
If you do not accept and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Service.
Policy Summary.
We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
We use your Personal Information for providing and improving the Service.
By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible at .
Information Collection And Use.
While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you.
Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your email address, name, phone number, postal address, credit card number and billing address (if purchases or requests are made online through our Service), information gathered from “cookies” as discussed below, and other information ("Personal Information").
We collect this information for the purpose of providing the Service, identifying and communicating with you, responding to your requests/inquiries, servicing your purchase orders or other requests, and improving our services.
Again, we will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

We collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Service ("Log Data").
This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics.
In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to increase our Service's functionality.
These third party service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information.
Cookies.
Cookies are files with a small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier.
Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and transferred to your device.
We use cookies to collect information in order to improve our services for you.

The Help feature on most browsers provide information on how to accept cookies, disable cookies or to notify you when receiving a new cookie.
If you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some features of our Service and we recommend that you leave them turned on.
Do Not Track Disclosure.
We do not support Do Not Track ("DNT").
Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.
You can enable or disable DNT by visiting the preferences or settings page of your web browser.
Since we don’t support this feature, enabling it will not eliminate tracking when you use our Service.
Service Providers.
We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services and/or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use your information for any other purpose.
AV Costar does not keep a copy of credit card information submitted through our portal.
