Privacy Statement.
By using this Site, you acknowledge that you have reviewed the terms of our Privacy Statement and Consent to Use of Data (the “Privacy Statement and Consent”) and agree that we may collect, use and transfer your Personal Data and User Data in accordance therewith.
The legal basis for this processing of your data is Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR for the Personal Data we process that forms the basis of a contract.
If you do not agree with these terms, you may choose not to use our Site, and please do not provide any Personal Data through this Site.
You can always revoke this consent at any time.

Provided that we are basing the processing of your personal data on the need to balance interests, you can raise an objection to this processing of your data.
This is the case if the processing is not required (in particular to) fulfil a contract with you.
When exercising such a right of objection, we request that you outline the reasons why we should not process your personal data in the manner we have described.
If you present to us your reasons, we shall check the circumstances and either stop and/or adjust the processing of the data, or present compelling counterarguments for continuing with the data processing.
You can of course object to the processing of your personal data for purposes of advertising and data analysis at any time.
You can inform us of your objection to the use of your data for advertising through the contact details given at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.

Information That You Give Us.
We collect Personal Data such as your name, e-mail, or mailing address from you when you voluntarily choose to register for or use certain Monnit Services at this Site.
We use the Personal Data that we collect in an effort to provide you with a superior customer experience on the Site and to improve and market Monnit Services.
Monnit may store such Personal Data itself or it may be stored in databases owned and maintained by Monnit’s affiliates, agents or service providers.
Monnit retains its rights to these databases and the information contained in them.
If you register with Monnit or use certain other of the personalized options we offer, we will create a profile that includes your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and other information that you provide that is pertinent to your specific situation.
We may combine such information with data gathered from other sources.
For instance, if incorrect postal codes are received, we may use third party software to correct them.
We also may collect e-mail or other addresses from prospect lists of other companies, for example, in connection with a joint marketing effort.
When we do so, (1) we acknowledge in our correspondence how the recipient was added to our list and (2) we provide a means for recipients to opt out of further communications from us.
When you contact Monnit we may keep a record of that correspondence and may occasionally ask you to complete surveys for sales and research purposes.
In some instances, we contract with outside parties to collect and maintain our information collection servers and to perform technology and related services.
We seek to provide any such third parties with only the information they need to perform their specific function and we require them to protect your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement and Consent.
Wherever Monnit collects Personal Data we will provide a link to this Privacy Statement and Consent.
Passively Collected User Data.
When you interact with Monnit through this Site, we receive and store certain "User Data".
Such User Data, which is collected passively using various technologies, is not used to specifically identify you.
Monnit may store such User Data itself or it may be stored in databases owned and maintained by Monnit’s affiliates, agents or service providers.
Monnit retains all rights to these databases and the information contained in them.
This Site will use such User Data together with data provided by other parties and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the keywords visitors used to find our Site and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers.
We also may disclose User Data in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.

If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Monnit and the affiliates, agents and service providers referred to herein located in the United States and in other countries.

g.
photocopying, mail charges) to the individual making the request.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
Even if you have requested removal of your Personal Data from our lists, Monnit reserves the right to retain it in our files in some limited circumstances such as when such Personal Data may be necessary to honor your request to opt out of further communications, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems or as provided in our Terms and Conditions.

Further, you acknowledge that due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems, Personal Data may continue to reside in our systems even after deletion.
Therefore, you should not expect that your Personal Data will be completely removed from our systems in response to your request.
Monnit will not respond to repetitious or vexatious requests for access.
In determining whether a request is repetitious or vexatious, it will consider such factors as the frequency with which information is updated, the purpose for which the information is used, and the nature of the information.
Monnit uses the Personal Data you provide for our business purposes in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement and Consent.
If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, that Personal Data will be available to us for use in connection with the reason for which it was provided or for a consistent purpose, including, if applicable, processing an order placed by you or informing you that the product is no longer available.

In addition, Monnit, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions.
Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments.
When we retain another non-affiliated company to perform a function of this nature, we seek to provide them with only the information that they need to perform their specific functions, and we require them to protect your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement and Consent and Monnit 's restrictions.
In addition, if you input Personal Data on a co-branded registration page, relating, for example, to a contest co-sponsored by both Monnit and a partner company, then your Personal Data will be available both to Monnit and to such partner company.
While Monnit will only use such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement and Consent, such partner company's use of your Personal Data will be subject to the privacy policy of that company and Monnit cannot be responsible for their use of your information.
We encourage you to review the privacy policy of such partner company before providing information on any such co-sponsored page or promotion.
