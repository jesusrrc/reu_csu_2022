We rely on that Personal Data for the legitimate commercial purposes of providing our products and services to you.
Where we need to collect Personal Data by law or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that Personal Data when requested, we may not be able to provide you with our products or services.
We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights before we process your Personal Data.
We do not use your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law.

We also may rely on your consent to collect, use or disclose your Personal Data.
If we are relying on your consent to process your Data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the information below.
We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the legal basis that allows us to do so.
If you are located in the EU and have any complaints regarding our privacy practices as a data controller, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to your local Supervisory Authority.
However, we would appreciate the chance to address your concerns before you approach your Supervisory Authority, so please contact us first at the information provided in this Privacy Notice.

Please note that there are certain exemptions and restrictions of these rights under the European data privacy laws that enable Personal Data to be retained, processed or withheld from access and we will inform you of these exemptions and restrictions, if applicable.
International Data TransfersWe offer European Union Model Clauses, also known as Standard Contractual Clauses, to meet the adequacy and security requirements for our customers that operate in the European Union and the United Kingdom, and make transfers of Personal Data from those jurisdictions to the United States and other countries that lack adequacy determinations.
