What data do we use for what purposes.
In the following we explain which personal data we process.
As far as such data is processed or stored, this occurs on your smartphone and /or in a IT environment.
Unless it is explicitly stated otherwise in the following sections the legal basis for this processing of data is Art.

different identification numbers in order to be able to uniquely assign the device to you.

3.
2 Tracking.
In order to display personalized content, we use service providers to track the usage of the app.
Please find below in this document all service providers we use for personalization purposes.
4.
Registration.
In order to be able to use the functions of this app, you must set up a personal user account (hereinafter “account”).
You can store your personal information (e.
g.
floor plans) in the account.
In order to set up a personal account, users must enter their email address and a freely selectable password, which at the same time serve as an access code for the account.
With the same access data, the user can also log on the magicplan cloud, which is part of the app, at                                    .
After successful registration, the user automatically receives confirmation by e-mail.
In this way, the user concludes the contract for the provision of the account with us.
In addition, users can store their personal contact details in their account and update these details at any time.
Unless you “log off” by clicking, so-called persistent cookies are stored on your terminal device, which serve to ensure that the user does not have to log on again during subsequent visits to the app.
The legal basis for the associated processing of your data and for the display of corresponding information in the App is Art.
6 (1) b) GDPR (performance of contract) or Art.
6 (1) f) GDPR (balancing of interests, based on our legitimate interest in providing users with a simple and customer-friendly user experience).

6.
App permissions.
In order to provide you with the functionalities of the app, the app must be able to access various functions and data on your mobile device.
For this purpose, it is technically absolutely necessary that you grant the app the following access permissions for the purposes described in each case.
Otherwise, the app is not fully usable for technical reasons.
The reason for this is that the permission settings in smartphone operating systems are usually programmed in such a way that some authorizations can only be granted or requested together and not in the form of individual partial authorizations.
Therefore, Sensopia is dependent in such cases on requesting the entire authorization from customers, even if only part of it is required and used specifically.
In the following, we will inform you about the permissions required by this app, whereby we will only use these to the extent required in each case, even if an authorization technically includes more.
The legal basis for the associated processing of your data is Art.
6 (1) b) GDPR (performance of contract) respectively Art.
6 (1) a) GDPR (your consent).

1 Your location.
Your consent to the collection of your current location is required for location-based services.
If you give your consent, your device may use your GPS data, WLAN identifiers and/or Bluetooth to determine your location, depending on what you have activated.
In any case, the app only collects your location only if you have previously agreed to this in the corresponding device settings.
For Android versions, consent is given after confirmation when downloading the app or in the device settings.
For Windows Mobile and iPhone versions, consent is given in a dialog box when the app is first opened as well as in the device settings.
Right of withdrawal.
You are entitled to revoke your consent at any time for the future.
Such revocation may be effected in the settings of the app under “Preferences -> Send data to improve magicplan”.
The legal basis for location processing is Art.
6 (1) a) GDPR (your consent).
6.
2 Card functionality.
Our app allows you to display your location on a map, provided you have consented to the collection of your location.
The app on the Android operating system uses the Google Maps service of Google Inc.
(1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA), which receives your IP address to display the map.
The legal basis for this is Art.
6 (1) f) GDPR (balancing of interests, based on our interest in offering you the most attractive app possible).
The relevant privacy policy of this third-party provider can be found at                                    .

(1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA 95014, USA).
