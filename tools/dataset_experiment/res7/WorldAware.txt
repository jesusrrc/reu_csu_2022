What Information is Collected.
Crisis24 Commercial Services.
Crisis24 collects both Personal Information and Other Information when you register for or use the Services.
Crisis24 does not collect any Sensitive Personal Information, known as Special Categories under GDPR, unless expressly directed to do so by your employer, whereby your employer would need to secure a lawful processing ground for such data.
“Personal Information” is any information or set of information relating to an identified person or an identifiable person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more factors specific to physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity.
For example, Personal Information includes name, address, email address, employer’s company name, job title, phone or fax number, employee ID, travel itineraries, including emergency contact information and, if requested by a client, passport numbers.
“Sensitive Personal Information” means Personal Information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, that concerns an individual’s health or sex life, criminal proceedings, or that is designated in writing by a third party as Sensitive Personal Information.
“Other Information” is any information that is not Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information.
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, Personal Information does not include information that is anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information.
For individuals residing in the European Union or in the United Kingdom, where Crisis24 collects Personal Information directly from you, we will inform you about the type of Personal Information collected, the purposes for which we collect and use the Personal Information, and the types of non-agent third parties to which Crisis24 discloses or may disclose that information, and the choices and means, if any, Crisis24 offer individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Information.
Under these circumstances, notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when you are first asked to provide Personal Information to Crisis24, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before Crisis24 uses or discloses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected or discloses it for the first time to a third party.
We collect Personal Information for the Crisis24 Commercial Services in the following circumstances.
You provide certain Personal Information to us when you.
(a) register to use the Services, (b) order products and services from us, and (c) send email messages, submit forms, or send other information to us.
Crisis24 may obtain Personal Information about you from third parties.
For example, we may receive data feeds, including your past, current, or future travel plans, from a travel agency, Global Distribution System (GDS) such as Sabre, or a data aggregator, such as itinerary aggregators in order to provide risk management services.
When you complete a profile form to obtain personalized Crisis24 reports, you are required to give your contact information (such as name and email address).
This information is used to contact you about Crisis24 services about which you have expressed interest.
It is optional for you to provide additional Personal Information (such as health and activity information) and unique identifiers (in the case of employees), but doing so permits Crisis24 to provide a more report.
If you use our Apps, Crisis24 may request to collect information about the precise location of your device using GPS, WiFi, or cellular network signals from your device.
Keep in mind precise location data cannot be collected unless you allow the app to use your terminal equipment location.
In particular, our Mobile App collects precise location when you use the “Crisis” or “Check In” buttons or when you use the App to learn about information that is relevant to your current location.
The app may collect precise location from your device on a real-time, continuous basis to inform you, and allow your organization to inform you, of incidents and threats near your current location.
In addition, our Critical Trac® app may collect precise location from your device on a real-time, continuous basis for tracking purposes and when you use the “Panic” and “Check In” buttons.
If you would like Crisis24 to stop collecting precise location from your device, please follow the instructions in the section below titled “The Choices Available to Users Regarding Collection, Use, Sharing, and Correction of Personal Information” and in our Cookie Policy.
In the event of a complaint, we may receive Personal Information about you from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to that complaint.

We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose.
Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity.
For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific feature of the Crisis24 platform or our websites.
However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
