ABOUT GDPR.
The European Union has made changes to its data protection laws following the introduction of its new General Data Protection Regulation which came into effect on May 25th.
​.
Whilst the new law only applies to the individual data of those based in Europe, the global nature of the internet means that every online service will be affected by the integration of the EU’s new data protection laws.
