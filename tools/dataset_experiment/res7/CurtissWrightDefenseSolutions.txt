THE LAWFUL BASIS ON WHICH WE RELY TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.
Curtiss-Wright will process your personal information for lawful reasons only.
As required by law, we will ensure there is a lawful basis for the processing of your personal information.
Where the processing is necessary for the performance of a contractual arrangement with you, we will process your personal data under the lawful basis of CONTRACT.
For example, we need to process your personal data to pay you in accordance with the requirements of any contract you may have with us, either on your own behalf, or on behalf of your employer.
Where the processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, such as compliance with applicable law, regulations, or court orders, we will process your personal data under the lawful basis of LEGAL OBLIGATION.
For example, we often must process personal information with organisations such as tax authorities, credit reference agencies, criminal records and disclosed barring services and restricted party screening agencies.
Where the processing is necessary to meet our legitimate business interests and there is a compelling justification for the processing and the processing is conducted in a way that is reasonably expected with minimal impact to an individual’s privacy rights, we will process your personal data under the lawful basis of LEGITIMATE INTEREST.
Where the processing is necessary to obtain an individual’s consent to process their data, we will process your personal data under the lawful basis of CONSENT.
We ensure that any consent is obtained via a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the individual’s agreement to the processing of their personal data (i.
e.
a positive opt-in).
When the processing has multiple purposes, consent will be obtained for each of them.
EXPLICIT CONSENT will be obtained using very clear and specific statements and any request for consent to process will be prominent and separate from our terms and conditions.
Individuals can withdraw consent at any time and refuse to offer consent without detriment.
SHARING YOUR PERSONAL DATA.
Curtiss-Wright will not sell or swap your information with any third party.
In accordance with applicable law, and only when such disclosure is necessary to enable our service providers to deliver the contracted services, Curtiss-Wright will share your personal information with third parties as defined below.

For example, we are required to provide relevant personal information to tax authorities or other legally mandated activity such as criminal investigations, court proceedings, the protection of your rights, the health and safety of our employees, customers, vendors, and visitors.
Service Providers.
Curtiss-Wright will share your personal information with approved third-party providers that we have contracted with to provide confidential services on our behalf.

PROTECTING YOUR PERSONAL DATA.
Curtiss-Wright takes the security of your personal information seriously.
We use technical and organisational measures to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.
These measures prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, accessed, altered, used or disclosed in an unauthorised way.
In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.
International transfers.
Curtiss-Wright is a US global organization, and your personal information may be transferred to, held, stored, or used across various locations worldwide such as, but not limited to, the US, UK, European Union, Costa Rica, Canada, Mexico, China and India.
This means that when we collect your personal information it may be processed in countries that may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
We transfer personal data from the UK, EU, and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not been determined by the UK, EU, and Switzerland authorities to have an adequate level of data protection.
For example, their laws may not guarantee you the same privacy rights or they may not be capable of addressing your complaints.
When we engage in such transfers, we use mandated legal mechanisms, such as the European Commission standard contractual clauses or the UK International Data Transfer Agreement to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data.
Technical and organisational measures.
All Curtiss-Wright affiliates and third-party agencies are required to comply with the provisions of this Privacy Notice and will implement contractual or other safeguarding measures to ensure an adequate level of protection to protect your rights to privacy and your personal information, appropriate to the laws of your country of residence.
These measures mandate a duty of confidentiality and an obligation to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of your personal data.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
STORING YOUR INFORMATION.
Your personal information will be stored on systems and in facilities owned or operated by Curtiss-Wright or those of our approved third-party suppliers.
It may be stored on systems and in facilities located both within and outside the EEA.
Your data may be stored on systems and in facilities located within countries approved by the EU and the UK and on servers located within countries not approved by the EU and the UK.
Within Curtiss-Wright, your information will be stored on our secured systems.
Retention of your personal data.
Curtiss-Wright policy is to retain only those records that are required for the effective running of our businesses and to meet our obligations to the individuals whose personal information we process.
Curtiss-Wright will retain your personal data in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements.
This means we will retain your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which we are processing it.
As soon as the personal information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected, it will be either anonymized (where permitted by applicable law), deleted or destroyed.
