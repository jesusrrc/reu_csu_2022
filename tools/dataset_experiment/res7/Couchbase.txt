COUCHBASE PRIVACY POLICY.
Introduction.
Your privacy and trust are important to us.
This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to websites, products, services, events and experiences (including the website  provided by Couchbase, Inc.
and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Couchbase”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
This Privacy Policy describes how Couchbase collects, uses, shares, and secures the personal data we collect.
It also describes your choices regarding use, access, and correction of personal data.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our information practices.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected, stored, shared, or distributed by our customers who may use Couchbase services to process personal data.
Nor does it apply to the practices of any other third-party.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected about our employees, who are covered by our internal notices, policies, and procedures, or about any employment candidates, who are covered by our Candidate Privacy Notice.
Additionally, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any websites, products, services, events, experience or any other content offered by third parties, which we do not review and for which we cannot be responsible.
Please review this Privacy Policy together with any other privacy notice we may provide to you in special circumstances (for example, if you attend any event), as this Privacy Policy supplements any such notice.
Couchbase is committed to the responsible handling and safeguarding of personal data about you.
We collect, use, disclose, transfer and store personal data to the extent needed to deliver our services and for operational business purposes as detailed in this Privacy Policy.
Personal Data We Collect.
The personal data we collect depends on how you interact with us and how you use our services.
We collect information about you from different sources and in various ways when you use our services, including information you provide directly, information collected automatically, and third-party data sources.
Information you provide directly.
You may provide us with personal data through day-to-day interactions, including registering for an event, posting a comment on our website, requesting information on our products and services, or requesting customer support.
For example, we may request the following types of personal data as necessary to develop or support our business relationship.
• Business contact details, such as name, address, phone number, and email address.
• Credentials, such as user name and password when you create an account or in connection with any troubleshooting or support inquiry.
• Payment information, such as credit card numbers, financial account information, and other payment details as needed when you make a purchase.
• Communications and content, such as information you enter as ‘free text’ content on our forms, forums, websites and in any communications with us.
Information we collect automatically.
When you interact with us or use our services, we may collect certain information automatically via technology.
For example.
• Identifiers and device information.
When you visit our websites, our web servers automatically log your Internet Protocol (IP) address, and information about your device, including device identifiers (such as MAC address).
device type.
your device’s operating system, browser, and other software including type, version, language, settings, and configuration.
and information about which website elements you interact with and your activity on the website and our services.
As further described in the Cookies and Similar Technologies section below and our Cookie Policy, we may collect certain technical information about your interaction with our services to help us improve our services, analyze usage, deliver advertising and improve your user experience.
• Product usage data.
Where available, to make our products and services more useful to you, we collect aggregated and individually identifiable product usage data, which includes product type, login date/time, pages and features used and other similar product metrics.
We automatically log your activity on our website including the URL of the website from which you came to our site.
Our emails may include links to open attachments, visit pages on our website, download content, launch surveys or take other actions.
If you are in our customer or prospect contact database, or have previously interacted with us online, then we may be able to link this usage data to your identity.
• Video imagery.
We employ video surveillance (CCTV) at our physical offices, for purposes of office access, safety and security.
Information we receive from other sources.
Not all of the information that Couchbase holds about you will always come directly from you.
For example, it may come from your employer if they are a customer using our products or services.
Or it may come from someone who has written a reference for you in relation to a job application.
We may also receive information about you from other sources, such as marketers, partners and service providers in order to offer services we think may be of interest to you.
If you provide us personal data about others, or if others give us information about you, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.
For example, we may obtain marketing data from other sources such as data brokers and combine that data with information we already have about you, to create more tailored advertising, products or services.
Children’s personal data.
Couchbase is committed to providing excellent products and services for enterprise customers.
Couchbase does not provide services for purchase by children, and this website is not intended for children.

Laws in these countries may differ from the laws applicable to your country of residence.
We take appropriate steps to ensure that personal data is processed, secured, and transferred in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
Where we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to other countries in which applicable laws do not offer the same level of data privacy protection, we rely on appropriate safeguards to help ensure an adequate level of data protection, such as ensuring any such transfer is subject to the terms of the applicable EU Model Clauses or other required and adequate transfer mechanism.

European Privacy Rights.
If you are a resident of the EU, EEA or UK, you have the following rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) with respect to our processing of personal data about you.
1.
Right to access and rectification.
You can request access to the personal data about you that we hold.
For personal data that is inaccurate or incomplete, you have a right to request that we correct or amend such data.
If any automated processing of personal data is based on your consent or a contract with you, you have a right to transfer or receive a copy of the personal data in a usable and portable format.
2.
Right of erasure.
Under certain circumstances, and subject to several exceptions, you have a right to request that we delete personal information about you.
3.
Right to withdraw consent.
If the processing of personal data is based on your consent, you can withdraw consent at any time for future processing.
4.
Right to object.
You can to object to, or obtain a restriction of, the processing of personal data under certain circumstances.
To make such requests, contact us at the address provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
California Privacy Rights.
If you are a California resident and the processing of personal information about you is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), you have certain rights with respect to that information.
1.
Right to know.
You have a right to request that we disclose to you certain information covering the 12 months preceding your request regarding the personal information we have collected about you.
You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such personal information.
Note that we have provided much of this information in this Privacy Policy.
2.
Right to request deletion.
You also have a right to request that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions.
3.
Right to opt-out.
You have a right to opt-out from future “sales” of personal information.
Note that although we do not sell personal information in the commonly-understood sense, the CCPA defines “sell” and “personal information” very broadly, and some of our data sharing described in this privacy statement may be considered a “sale” under those definitions.
In particular, we let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses, cookie IDs, and mobile IDs through our website, and in some cases making that information available to our advertising and analytics partners could be a “sale” under the CCPA.
For more information, including how to opt-out, please see our Cookie Policy.
You may make a request to know or a request to delete by contacting us through the methods provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA.
Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.
Further, to provide or delete specific pieces of personal information we will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law.
Finally, you have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights set out in the CCPA.
If you are a California resident, you or an authorized agent may exercise your rights under the CCPA by contacting us through one of the methods below, by calling us at +1-855-925-1356 or by submitting our webform available here.
How We Secure Personal Data.
We take reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical security measures to help protect personal data against unauthorized access, loss, destruction or alteration.
Such safeguards are selected based on the level of sensitivity of the information we collect, process, and store and the current state of technology.
Some of the safeguards we employ are firewalls, data encryption, and information access controls.
To help us protect personal data, we request that you use a strong password and never share your password with anyone or use the same password with other sites or accounts.
How Long We Keep Personal Data.
We retain personal data for as long as we reasonably require it for legal or business purposes, taking into consideration local laws, contractual obligations, and the expectations and requirements of our customers.
When we no longer need personal data, we securely delete or destroy it.
Anonymous Data.
We may create and use De-Identified Data from personal data about you by excluding elements of information that identify you from such data.
We use this De-Identified Data to improve our website and our product offerings and for marketing and analytics purposes by analyzing search, traffic and usage.
We may disclose De-Identified Data to third-party companies in our sole discretion.
“De-Identified Data” means data that has been rendered anonymous in such a way that you are not or are no longer identifiable based on that data.
Your Right to Access and Control Personal Data.
Upon request, Couchbase will provide you with information about whether we hold any personal data about you.
You may access, correct, or request deletion of such personal data by logging into your account or contacting us at We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe, and no later than within one month of receipt of such request.
Where we may process data on behalf of another party that is the “data controller,” (such as a Couchbase customer), we may not have any ability to know to whom it relates, thus, you should direct any request to access, correct, amend, or delete such data to that party.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns.
In certain circumstances, we may be required by law to retain personal data or may need to retain personal data in order to continue providing a service.
Cookies and Similar Technologies.
We and our partners use cookies, web beacons, unique identifiers and other similar technologies to provide our services and help collect data.
We do this to understand your use of our websites, emails, mobile applications and services, improve your user experience and enable personalized features and content, optimize our advertisements and marketing, and to enable third party advertising companies to assist us in serving advertising specific to your interests across the internet.
For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.
(“Google”), to collect and prepare information about the traffic on our websites.
You can find more information about the use of Google Analytics in Google’s privacy policy, and about the currently available opt-out options provided by Google here.
For more information about our use of cookies and related technologies and how you can control or opt-out of interest-based advertising on your browser or device usage and manage them, please see our Cookie Policy.
Couchbase currently does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals from browser or mobile application settings due to lack of standardization regarding how such signals should be interpreted.
Couchbase will continue to monitor industry activity in this area and reassess our DNT practices as necessary.
Changes to this Privacy Policy.
We will update this Privacy Policy as needed to reflect changes in our services or the applicable legal requirements.
If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on this website, and in the case of any material changes we shall notify you before such material changes take effect.
Your continued use of the services after the date the changes take effect shall be subject to the revised Privacy Policy.
