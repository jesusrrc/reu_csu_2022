WEBALO PRIVACY POLICY.
Effective Date.
June 27, 2020.
This Privacy Policy covers the practices of Webalo, Inc.
and our affiliates (“Webalo,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) concerning personal information that we obtain about personnel of our past, present and prospective customers, business partners and suppliers, subject to the important exception described below.
A special note about data processed by our software and services.
Webalo software and services allow Webalo customers to collect, distribute, visualize, and otherwise manage their own data.
In many use cases, this data stays entirely within the customer’s network, and Webalo has no access to it.
In the limited situations and configurations in which Webalo has access to a portion of a customer’s data, Webalo processes it solely to provide our service to that particular customer.
Webalo handles that data solely pursuant to our contract with that customer, not pursuant to Webalo’s own Privacy Policy.
Thus, for example, the references in this Privacy Policy to performing our own analytics on the data we collect do not apply to that customer data.
To the extent the data we receive through our services relates to an identified or identifiable individual, Webalo handles such data solely as the customer’s “processor” within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and similar laws, and solely as the customer’s “service provider” within the meaning of the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).
We handle all data received through our services in that manner, regardless of whether those laws apply.
Any inquiries or requests relating to such data should be directed to the relevant customer, not to Webalo.
This Privacy Policy contains the following sections.
