The different ways we collect personal information and the types of personal information we collect are described below.

Connected Devices.

Device network identifiers and connectivity data related to the use of voice telecommunications service is commonly referred to as Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”).
CPNI is subject to special Federal laws and regulations, with which Kajeet fully complies.
Aggregate Customer information (“ACI”) is collective data that relates to a group or category of services or customers, from which information identifying individual Customers and Users have been removed.
It is the policy of Kajeet to treat all CPNI and ACI in a confidential manner and to limit access, disclosure and use of such information in a manner that is compliant with the 1996 Telecommunications Act and by the FCC.
All employees or representatives of Kajeet, including those who have access to or use CPNI or ACI, receive mandatory annual CPNI training, including, without limitation, training with respect to when they are and are not authorized to access and use CPNI or ACI.

Kajeet Websites.
When visitors browse Kajeet websites, Kajeet may collect certain electronic information, such as the IP address of the visitor’s computer.
Kajeet websites also use cookies (i.
e.
, a small piece of code stored on your device for record-keeping purposes) or similar mechanisms to better understand how visitors use our website and for analytics purposes.
At times, Kajeet may utilize third-party providers that collect certain electronic information, such as your computer’s IP address and how you use Kajeet’s websites, directly from Kajeet websites.
Finally, Kajeet may collect information that is provided by visitors to Kajeet websites by contacting Kajeet directly through email links to ask questions or make comments.

Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features.
Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked.
Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, Kajeet does not currently respond to those signals.
