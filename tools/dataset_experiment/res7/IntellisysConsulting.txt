Additional information, such as dietary preferences, preferred location, events, or group bookings, enable us to provide the best possible service to you in person or digitally based on your needs and communicated interests.
You may also be given the opportunity to provide your cell/mobile phone number during various processes, or through a separate email from one of our affiliates.

We may also collect personal data in other contexts that we will notify you of at the time.
Information We Obtain.
Information You Provide.
Personal data you provide directly to us will be apparent from the context in which you provide it.
For example.
If you fill out a form, you generally will provide your name, contact details, and any other information requested on the form, such as the reason for your inquiry or your product preferences.

Each form varies in the information required and collected.
In most cases, an asterisk (*) indicates the required information on a form.
You may choose to provide additional information within fields that are not required.
If you participate in web-based contests or surveys, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, so you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
Intelisys may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests.
That company is prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with any third party, unless we give you prior notice.
Information We Collect Automatically.
Our web servers may log information such as your operating-system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located.
The web server logs may also record information such as the address of the web page that referred you to one of our sites, and the IP address of the device you use to connect to the internet.
They may also log information about your interaction with the sites, such as which pages you visit.
To control which web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags called web beacons—small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies.
We also may collect information from your browser, such as your browsing history, and use it in conjunction with data gathered from forms and emails—to help us understand and respond to your needs.

These widgets may collect information about which pages you visit on our sites, and the IP address of the device you use to connect to the internet.
Any of the widgets may also set cookies to ensure the features are functioning properly.
Social- media functions and widgets are hosted either by a third party or directly on our sites.
Your interactions with the social-media functions and widgets located on our sites are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.
If you use any of the social-media functions or widgets on our sites, we strongly suggest you review the privacy policies of the companies that provide those functions and features.
WordPress Plug-ins and third-party web platform toolsSome of our sites are built on the web content management system (CMS) WordPress.
Each of these sites incorporates functionality from a number of third-party plug-ins which may gather aggregate or general data in order to properly deliver the service or function they provide, such as your IP address and derived geographic location in order to serve you location-specific content, what browser your or using, or your device type in order to alter the layout or function of the plug-in content to best suit your needs.

Those countries may not have the same data-protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the personal data.

Information collected by our digital properties, or transferred to us from other sources, will be processed in the United States, Europe, or Latin America.

In all cases, we keep it for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it.
We will then delete the personal data—unless we are legally required to retain it, or we need to retain it in order to comply with our legal obligations (for example, for tax and accounting purposes).
