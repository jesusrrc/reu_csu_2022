Enterprise Online Privacy Statement.
Privacy and data protection at DXC.
This policy has been updated on June 9, 2022 to reflect DXC’s continued efforts in striving to provide best-in-class privacy and data protection.
The section ‘Information Security, Accuracy and Retention’ has been updated to make available to you an overview of the technical and organizational measures (“TOMs”) implemented by DXC.
Moreover, as indicated by the TOMs, DXC now maintains a formal Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) that achieved formal certification as defined in ISO/IES 27701 for its global and regional delivery centers.
At DXC our commitment to privacy goes beyond the minimum legal and regulatory requirements.
We strive for best-in-class data protection and privacy management, which requires a sound data privacy governance structure and an effective data privacy compliance and best practices program to ensure DXC meets ever-changing and increasingly complex regulatory standards and all contractually agreed privacy obligations.
DXC's Global Privacy and Data Protection Office has strategic and operational responsibility for this program, which is adequately resourced and appropriately organized to ensure the policies and compliance processes, technology and physical controls and security we rely upon to govern the collection, use, storage and transfer of personal data all over the world meets statutory and regulatory requirements.
Therefore, DXC's approach is to coordinate the contribution of several corporate disciplines - including ethics and compliance, legal, human resources, and information and physical security - to achieve our "best in class" data protection and privacy management objectives.
Highlights of This Approach.
Strong board and executive management commitment to DXC's compliance with privacy law through appropriate organizations and programs.
DXC’s Ethics and Compliance.
The Ethics and Compliance organization’s charter and responsibilities are evidenced by Board resolution, which assigns day-to-day management responsibility for DXC’s ethics and compliance program to DXC’s Vice President, Ethics and Compliance.
The Ethics and Compliance Mission.
Promote throughout the global DXC Technology community a culture of performance with integrity that encourages ethical conduct and values, and drives compliance with the Code of Business Conduct, internal policies, and the law.
DXC's Global Privacy and Data Protection Office (PDPO).
Led by DXC’s Group Data Protection Officer based in the European Union (EU), DXC's global PDPO is a well-resourced and qualified strategic compliance function that operates under the authority of DXC's Ethics and Compliance organization.
The PDPO is responsible and accountable to advise DXC's businesses on best practices in privacy compliance, and to develop policies, procedures, training, risk assessment and monitoring programs that enable DXC to provide adequate levels of personal data protection for its clients, employees and other relevant individuals in all geographies and jurisdictions the world over.
Compliance Policies, Standards, and Processes.
A strong, globally applicable Privacy and Data Protection Policy which reflects the Generally Accepted Privacy Principles ("GAPP") applicable to the collection, use, storage, and processing of personal data.
Comprehensive and cohesive compliance standards, processes, and procedures, which ensure consistent privacy and data protection across all of DXC's legal entities and businesses.
Employee Training and Awareness.
DXC takes a holistic approach to ensure privacy-aware employees throughout the employment lifecycle including new-hire instructions, annual awareness briefings, targeted training for high-risk populations, and periodic awareness messaging.
Strong Risk Management Programs.
In light of the inherent exposures to DXC's operational and strategic goals, DXC is committed to ensuring that risk management is a core competency, and an integral part of DXC's business operations that supports and informs reliable, quality decision making.
Subject to the Chief Risk Officer’s management and direction, the resources in both the Ethics and Compliance organization and its Privacy and Data Protection Office are integral parts of DXC's overall risk assessment program and posture, which includes internal and external audit and monitoring functions.
With regular privacy risk assessments, the PDPO monitors emerging exposures and remediates weaknesses in an effort to constantly mature DXC's compliance capabilities.
A consistent Privacy Impact Assessment program is carried out on new and changed services, systems, and processes, aiming to disclose potential issues before they become a problem.
Formal data breach handling procedures and a robust 24/7 operated incident response center supplement regulatory and contractual notification requirements, enabling constant vigilance and readiness in case of a crisis.
Strong, Collaborative Cross-Disciplinary Partnerships.
Inclusive of key internal stakeholders, including strong collaborative ties to DXC’s information and physical security, legal, human resources, and key business unit personnel without whom strict compliance with privacy laws is not possible.
Flexible Service Delivery Model.
A strong and robust global service delivery model that is flexible enough to meet the privacy requirements of the highly sensitive, regulated, and classified data environments.
Formal Dispute Resolution Mechanism.
A one-stop point of contact for our employees and clients for any privacy related matters regardless of the geography, business, or service.
If you have specific concerns or requests, please feel free to send an email to .

SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA.
DXC will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others.

INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS.
DXC recognizes and respects the varying national laws and obligations and their impact on cross-border data transfers.
When transferring personal information outside of the country of collection for the purposes identified above, DXC will do so in compliance with applicable law.
In the development of DXC’s privacy policies and standards, we respect and take into account the major privacy and data protection principles and frameworks around the world and any amendments applied thereto from time-to-time, including as examples the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the UK Data Protection Act, the APEC Privacy Framework, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and the Australian Privacy Act.
EU Personal Data Transfers.
For personal data originating from a European Union (EU) member state, DXC uses a variety of lawful data transfer mechanisms for this purpose, including EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).
DXC has an intragroup agreement on the transfer and processing of personal data within the DXC group worldwide which has the EU Standard Contractual Clauses incorporated.
This agreement allows DXC to ensure that personal data, including data originating from the EU, which is transferred cross-border and processed by other DXC group companies, including those located outside the EU, is adequately protected in accordance with applicable data protection law.
PRIVACY SHIELD FRAMEWORK.
The decision of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) invalidating the Privacy Shield framework ─ in place to streamline and legitimize data transfers between the US and EU member nations ─ led DXC to suspend its participation in this framework.
Although DXC had been certified for compliance with the Privacy Shield framework, we have used and maintain properly executed data transfer agreements, including the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), to legitimize all of our customer personal data transfers globally, including those that were necessary to conduct customer and company business between the US and EU nations.
These agreements continue in full force and effect today.
CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT - CCPA.
DXC is committed to the lawful treatment and confidential handling of sensitive information, including personal information about California residents, and has adopted a set of global information management policies including privacy and data protection, security, system access, information classification, and other relevant policies governing the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, retention, and deletion of information.

(2) only in accordance with the contract and Business’s prior written instructions, if any.
unless (3) as otherwise required by the CCPA.
DXC confirms that it will not process personal information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the services specified in the contract.
