Customer Data.
You may provide us with Personal Data such as your name, workplace and position, contact details (such as e-mail, phone and address), as well as any other data you choose to provide in order to procure our Service or contact us.
To the extent that such data concerns a non-human entity, we will not regard it as “Personal Data” and this Privacy Policy shall not apply to it.
Moreover, we collect or generate certain technical data concerning your use of the Service.
We collect or generate such data either independently or with the help of third-party services (as detailed in Section 4 below), including through the use of “cookies” and other tracking technologies (as further detailed in Section 5 below).

Data Controller/Processor.
Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data.
the “Data Controller” (or under the CCPA, “business”), who determines the purposes and means of processing.
and the “Data Processor” (or under the CCPA, “service provider”), who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller (or business).
Below we explain how these roles apply to our Service, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.
Sternum is the “Data Controller” of its Customers’ Personal Data, and with respect to which, assumes the responsibilities of Data Controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Only to the extent that a Customer has submitted any Consumer Personal Data to the Service, such data shall be processed by Sternum on behalf of our Customer, and may be shared with such Customer in accordance with this Privacy Policy and in accordance with their reasonable instructions and our agreements with them.
Such Customer shall be deemed the “Data Controller” of its Consumers’ Personal Data and Sternum will process such data on this Customer’s behalf, as its “Data Processor”.
The Customer will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to Data Controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).
