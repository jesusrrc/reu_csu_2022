If Wiliot processes any End User Personal Data on behalf of a Customer, such Customer shall be deemed the “Data Controller” of its End Users’ data, and Wiliot will generally process such data on this Customer’s behalf, as its “Data Processor”.
This means that in such cases, we will process such End Users’ data on behalf of our Customer and in accordance with its reasonable instructions, subject to our Terms of Service and other commercial agreements.
The Customer will be solely responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to Data Controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).

Data Subject Rights.

Please note that once you contact us by e-mail, we may require additional information and documents, including certain Personal Data, in order to authenticate and validate your identity and to process your request.
Such additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.
g.
as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in accordance with Section 3 above.
If you would like to make any requests or queries regarding Personal Data we process on a Customer’s behalf, please contact such Customer directly.
For example, if you are an End User who wishes to access, correct, or delete data processed by Wiliot on behalf of a Customer, please direct your request to the relevant Customer (who is the “Data Controller” of such data).
