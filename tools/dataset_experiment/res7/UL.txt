When placing an order or carrying out a transaction on the Site, you may be asked for financial information such as credit card details.
You may also voluntarily share other information such as feedback, opinions, or information shared via the Contact Us feature.
Cookies – A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s computer that is tied to information about the user.
When you visit the Site, we send one or more cookies to your computer or other browsing device.
We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, some UL features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
Web beacons – Web pages may contain electronic images (called a “single-pixel GIF” or “web beacon”) that allow a web site to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.
We use web beacons to track the effectiveness of an email campaign and to transfer an individual’s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) and associate your updated information into our database.
Our practice is to include web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages (messages that include graphics) that we send directly or through third parties in order to determine, among many other items, which email messages were opened and to note whether a message was acted upon.
In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.
Log information – When you access the Site via a browser, application or other client, our servers automatically record certain information.
This may include information such as your web request, your interaction with a service, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.
Please see our Cookie Policy for more detailed information regarding cookies and web beacons.

We provide such information to our subsidiaries and affiliated companies where it is necessary to meet the purpose for which you have submitted your personal data and in particular if necessary for the provision of services, account administration, sales, marketing and support.
We take steps to ensure that UL companies follow our data protection policy, this privacy notice and applicable local law when handling personal data.
This includes having in place proper data transfer mechanisms such as EU standard contractual clauses.
To third party contractors and providers that perform certain functions on behalf of UL, such as sending email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data and processing credit card payments, direct marketing services, and cloud hosting services.
These parties only have access to such information as necessary to perform their functions and may not use it for any purpose other than to provide services to us.
UL, like all companies, is required to respond to lawful requests from law enforcement bodies to access UL premises and systems for purposes relating to national security.
This will be strictly limited to the data relevant to the scope of a request and to data subjects covered by the legal jurisdiction of requests.
We may also process personal data directly relevant to investigating and handling a criminal or civil lawsuit or to take action to prevent fraud, abuse or other violations of our Site Terms of Use.
For other lawful purposes that may arise such as due to any merger, acquisition, financing, sale of company assets or interests in the company, or transition of service to another provider, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership.
Safeguarding your information.
UL uses commercially reasonable efforts to employ security measures designed to protect your personal information from loss, destruction, or access by unauthorized persons.
These include, but are not limited to.
Physical safeguards such as locked doors and file cabinets, controlled access to our facilities and secure destruction of media containing your personal information.
Technology safeguards, like the use of anti-virus and endpoint protection software, and monitoring of our systems and data centers to ensure that they comply with our security policies.
Organizational safeguards, like training and awareness programs on security and privacy, to make sure employees understand the importance and means by which they must protect your personal information.
Data Retention.
We will retain your information for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.
The criteria used to determine our retention periods include.
How long is the data needed to provide you with our products or services or to operate our business.
