How Grabit                      Shares Information It Collects From Users.
5.
1.
Sharing between Customers and Couriers.
Once a Courier accepts a delivery request from a Customer, the Customer can see the Courier’s first                  name and last initial and the Courier can see whatever name the Customer provided when signing up.
A                  Customer is also able to see a Courier’s photo.
During a delivery, the Customer in some instances is                  able to see the Courier’s real-time location, and the Courier is able to see the Customer’s delivery                  address.
During a delivery, Customers and Couriers are able to call and text each other.
Customer and                  Courier phone numbers are masked and, only in rare instances, may they be able to see the other’s                  phone number.
As described above, Customers are able to see a Courier’s aggregate ratings during a                  delivery.
After a delivery, we may share feedback or comments that a Customer provides with a                  Courier, but we will not identify the Customer.
We may also share with Couriers their aggregate                  ratings.
