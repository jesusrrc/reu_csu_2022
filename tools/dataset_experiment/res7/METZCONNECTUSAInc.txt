This includes all data with which you can be personally identified with.
We treat your data confidentially and in accordance with the legal data protection regulations.

Processing of your personal data.
Visiting our Website.
When you visit our website, data is automatically collected by our IT systems.
This is mainly technical data (e.
g.
internet browser, operating system or time at which the page was accessed).
This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter our website.
Part of the data is recorded to ensure that the website works without any errors.
Other data can be used to analyse your user habits.
Personal data such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or other identifying information is not collected.
We will only collect this data if you provide us with this information voluntarily, for example by sending an e-mail or using the contact form.
You can therefore visit our website without providing personal data.
We reserve the right to make the data you provide anonymous, store it in aggregated form and, if necessary, combine it with other data in order to compile anonymous statistics (e.
g.
on-site traffic).
If you contact us by e-mail, the data you provide will be stored automatically.
We process your personal data exclusively for the purpose of answering your enquiries and in the event of follow-up questions, or we store it in order to contact you in the future.
We would like to point out that data transmission on the internet, for example when communicating by e-mail, can have security gaps and therefore a complete protection of data against access by third parties cannot be guaranteed by us.
4.
Storage, use and processing of your data.
We use, process and store your personal data for the purpose of fulfilling your requests, such as answering your enquiries, processing orders, preparing, negotiating, handling and fulfilling contracts and sending you specific information.
5.
Passing on your data.
Your data will only be passed on the basis of contractual agreements (Art.
6 para.
1 lit.
b) or legal obligations (Art.
6 para.
1 lit.
c).
Within the framework of order processing in accordance with Art.
28 GDPR, we make use of external service providers (e.
g.
in the field of IT services).
These have been carefully selected and commissioned by us and are bound by our instructions.
6.
Your rights when processing your personal data.
To exercise your rights, please contact the responsible office of METZ CONNECT GmbH.
For this, an informal notification sent to us by e-mail to is sufficient.
The legality of the data processing carried out up to the point of revocation remains unaffected.
a) Right of access to information.
You have the right to request information about your personal data processed by us.
Within the scope of your rights as a data subject, you can request the following.
Information about processing purposes and categories of personal data.
Categories of recipients to whom your personal data has been or will be disclosed.
Storage duration.
Existence of a right of rectification, erasure, restriction of processing or opposition.
Existence of a right of appeal to the supervisory authority.
Origin of your data, provided it was not collected by us.
The existence of automated decision making, including profiling.
b) Right of rectification.
You have the right to correct incorrect or complete incomplete personal data without delay.
c) Right of deletion (“right to be forgotten”).
You have the right to obtain the immediate deletion (“right to be forgotten”) of your personal data, if, for example, the purpose of the processing is no longer necessary, if you revoke your consent or if there is no legal basis.
d) Right to restrict processing.
You have the right to limit the processing of your personal data, for example, if the accuracy of the data is disputed, if the processing is unlawful and you refuse to have it deleted and instead request the limitation of use, provided that we no longer need it for the purposes of the processing but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or if an objection to the processing has been lodged.
e) Right to data transferability.
You have the right to have personal data that you have provided us with handed over or transferred to another responsible person in a structured, common and machine-readable format, if the processing is automated.
A direct transfer of your personal data to another responsible person will only take place to the extent that this is technically possible.
f) Right of objection.
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation.
Your data will no longer be processed after revocation, unless we can prove compelling reasons for processing worthy of protection that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
Furthermore, you may at any time object to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of direct marketing.
g) Right to automated decisions, including profiling.
You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects vis-à-vis you or significantly affects you in a similar way.
This means that you have the right to question this decision and, if necessary, to obtain rectification.
h) Right of appeal to a supervisory authority.
In the event of violations of data protection laws or if you believe that the processing of your personal data is unlawful, you have a right of appeal to a supervisory authority.
The supervisory authority responsible for our location is the State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information in Baden-Württemberg.
7.
Protection of your data when visiting our website.
For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption.
You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from “ to “ and by the lock symbol in your browser line.
If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
8.
Contact form.
If you send us enquiries via the contact form, your details from the enquiry form, including the contact data you provide there, will be stored by us for the purposes of processing the enquiry and in the event of follow-up enquiries.
The processing of the data entered in the contact form is thus exclusively based on your consent (Art.
6 para.
1 lit.
a GDPR).
You can revoke this consent at any time.
For this purpose, an informal notification sent to us by e-mail is sufficient.
The legality of the data processing operations carried out up to revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
The data entered by you in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent for storage or the purpose for which the data was stored ceases to apply (e.
g.
after your request has been processed).
Mandatory legal provisions – in particular retention periods – remain unaffected by this.
As we exclusively maintain business relations with companies according to §14 BGB, it is necessary to provide the complete company address.
When sending the contact form, therefore, only the full name and e-mail address are personal.
We collect this data in the legitimate interest according to Art.
6 paragraph 1 lit.
f, in order to ensure a smooth establishment of contact and to be able to assign you to the responsible contact person.
9.
Application procedure.
We collect and process the personal data of applicants for the purpose of processing the application procedure.
The processing can also take place electronically.
This is particularly the case if an applicant submits the relevant application documents to us electronically, in the applicant portal, by e-mail or via the contact form.
If the person responsible for processing concludes an employment contract with an applicant, the transmitted data is stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with the statutory provisions.
If no employment contract is concluded with the applicant, the application documents are automatically deleted 6 months after notification of the refusal decision, unless deletion would be contrary to any other legitimate interests for the processing.
Should we wish to keep your application documents for a longer period of time in order to offer you positions that may become vacant at a later date, we will ask you for your consent in advance.
Other legitimate interests in this sense are, for example, a duty of proof in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).
Further information on the handling of applicant data can be found here.
