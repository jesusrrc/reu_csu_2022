We may transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the UK government.
The list of countries that benefit from adequacy decisions will change from time to time, but includes the EEA.
We will usually seek to rely on an adequacy decision where one exists.
‍.
Where we use certain service providers or are otherwise transferring your personal data to a country for which there is no adequacy decision, we will only do so if we are satisfied appropriate safeguards are in place and enforceable rights and effective legal remedies are available for data subjects.
These safeguards will usually include using specific contracts approved for use for international transfers which give personal data similar protection to that it has in the UK.

We may also transfer personal data where a specific exception applies under data protection law, for example if the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between us or to take pre-contract steps at your request, for a contract in your interests between us and another person, or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
