Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Commitment is jointly made by Sensors Data Network Technology (Beijing) Co.
, Ltd.
and related parties ("service providers").
Definitions.
Customer.
The party who uses the service provided by Sensors Data.
Sensors Data.
Sensors Data Network Technology (Beijing) Co.
, Ltd.
and related parties ("service providers").
Sensors Data solemnly promises not to touch any data.
All systems of Sensors Data adopt the system structure of privatization deployment.
Both the system is deployed in the customer's server room or the customer's public cloud.
All security measures and permission restrictions are controlled by the customer, and Sensors Data cannot obtain customer data.
.

Sensors Data promises not to actively contact any unnecessary raw data or statistical results in the form of reports during product implementation and maintenance.
If Sensors Data proactively contacts relevant information and causes losses to customers due to leakage, Sensors Data will to bear corresponding legal liabilities.
The data products provided by Sensors Data can only be used for Legitimate uses.
Customers can only use the services provided by Sensors Data and related application software (including but not limited to SDK, software, and underlying storage) for Legitimate uses.
Customers need to ensure that their use of this service and related application software comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements, does not infringe the intellectual property rights and other legal rights of any third party, And does not violate the provisions of the binding legal documents.
If the customer violates the above agreement, Sensors Data has the right to suspend the customer’s use of this service and related application software or terminate this agreement.
The service fee collected will not be refunded, and Sensors Data is therefore subject to long-term third-party recourse, administrative investigation or involvement in other legal procedures, the client must also compensate for all losses suffered by Sensors Data (including but not limited to the costs of responding to the lawsuit, the costs incurred in cooperation with the investigation, media public relations costs, third-party recourse compensation, compensation, lawyers Fees etc.
).
How to use collected information.
