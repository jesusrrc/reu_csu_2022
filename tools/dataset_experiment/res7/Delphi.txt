it is necessary for Delphi to be able to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation or with any decision, request or requirement from a public authority.
or.
it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interest pursued by us or by a third party, such as to answer any queries from you or to provide support in relation to our services and products, to provide you with information about Delphi, to manage other requests made via the Websites (e.
g.
a job application) or to notify you about any changes to our services, to make statistics, to present our Websites and their content in a suitable and effective manner for you, to use essential cookies in relation to our Websites as described above and to enforce our Websites Terms & Conditions.

Delphi makes sure that only the Personal Data that are necessary to achieve the above-listed purposes are processed.

Delphi will endeavor to keep the Personal Data in our possession or control accurate.
Individuals providing Personal Data are therefore responsible for promptly informing Delphi of any change to their Personal Data.

Disclosure of Personal Data.
To achieve the purposes listed above, we may disclose Personal Data to the following categories of recipients.

public authorities and administrations.
affiliate companies of Delphi.

Transfer of Personal Data within the Delphi group.
Being a global company operating worldwide, Delphi processes Personal Data in several countries and from different origins, and transfers data all over the globe.
Delphi is sharing data in the normal course and scope of business with other affiliated companies, as well as third parties.
Data Subjects are informed that certain recipients may be located outside the territory of the European Union and in countries that do not offer a level of protection equivalent to the one granted in the European Union.
This is the case when Personal Data is shared with Delphi Technologies, Inc in the USA.
In this respect, Delphi has taken appropriate guaranties and concluded the necessary agreements to ensure complete security of the Personal Data transferred.
In addition, Delphi has decided that the adoption of Binding Corporate Rules is the most appropriate mechanism to ensure that intra-group transfers of Personal Data are compliant with Data Protection Legislation.
Copies of this document and of existing agreements can be provided upon written request at [email protected].
Other transfers to external third parties located outside the European Union in countries not deemed to offer an equivalent level of protection for personal data may also be authorized Data Protection Legislation under a derogation relating, as the case may be, to the performance of a contract concluded in your interest or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the performance of a contract between you and us.
