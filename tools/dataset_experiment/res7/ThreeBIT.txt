It does not include information relating to a company or other legal entity.
Three may engage third parties (other than its own employees) to provide services to it.
Any of those third parties who process personal data on our behalf is a “Data Processor”.
“Processing” means any action performed on personal data, including collection, storage, copying, consulting, disclosure or destruction.
Processing of Your Data.
We have extensive controls in place to maintain the security of our information and information systems.
Client files are protected with safeguards according to the sensitivity of the relevant information.
