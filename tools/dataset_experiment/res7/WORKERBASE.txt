When you click an ad delivered by Google, a cookie for conversion tracking is stored on your computer.
Cookies are small text files that are stored locally in the cache of the user’s browser.
These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user.
Should the user visit certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.
Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie.
Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an Adwords advertiser.
The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the Adwords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking.
The Adwords advertisers can find out the total number of users who have clicked on their ad and were directed to the page with a conversion tracking tag.
The advertisers do not, however, obtain any information that can be used to identify users personally.
If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can refuse by simply deactivating the Google conversion tracking cookie via your internet browser settings.
In doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.
For more information about Google AdWords and Google conversion tracking, please see Google’s privacy policy at.
