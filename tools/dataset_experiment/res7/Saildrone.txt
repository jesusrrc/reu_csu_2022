Disable pressure data in the Application settings menu to stop collection of pressure readings and associated location data.

CALIFORNIA DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURES.
Some browsers can transmit a “do not track” signal or other similar mechanisms.
Unfortunately, there is not yet an adopted standard for how to respond to these signals.
SAILDRONE does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
However, some third-party sites do keep track of Your browsing activities when they serve YOU content, which enables them to tailor what they present to YOU.
If YOU are visiting such sites, Safari, a feature that allows iOS users the ability to limit targeting and tracking of web browsing behavior by various web services, allows YOU to set the DNT signal on Your browser, so that third parties know YOU do not want to be tracked.
If YOU would like to learn how to set Safari so that websites do not track YOU, go here.
Third parties that have content embedded in the iOS environment and websites such as a social feature or a stock ticker may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited a specific iOS website from a certain IP address.
Third parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from Apple’s websites, unless YOU provide it to them directly.
