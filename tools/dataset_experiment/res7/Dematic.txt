In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.
They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
8.
Data Retention.
How long will you use my personal data for.
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Where by law we have to keep basic information including, but not limited to, Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data for six years after fulfilling the purposes for which we collected it for tax purposes, we will retain for 6 years.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data, by writing to us and asking us to delete the information.

Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).
This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND.
