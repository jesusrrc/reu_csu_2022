This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information we collect and use on our corporate websites, including  (collectively referred to as the “Site”), and does not apply to our data matching and advertising related services (“Traverse Products”).
Please see our Product Privacy Policy for information on our privacy practices and your choices as they relate to Traverse products and services.

Types of Information We Collect.
Information You Provide Us.
You may choose to voluntarily directly provide certain personal information to us — such as your first and last name, company, email address, postal address, and/or telephone number.
For example, you provide this information to us when you fill out a form, send Traverse a message requesting product and service information, or contact us with questions about this Privacy Policy.
Any information we retain would be used to assure the delivery of the services or information you requested, manage any follow-up questions you may have, and to tailor personalized communications or promotions to you in the future.
Information Collected Automatically.
We (or our third party service providers, which include advertising networks and other data brokers) may automatically collect information from your browser or your mobile device when you interact with the Site.
For example, this could include your web request, browser type, IP address, mobile device IDs, or the frequency and duration of your visits to the Site.
If you visit the Site on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent experience or to provide you relevant Traverse advertisements in the future.
If we do combine any automatically collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy.
Cookies, Pixels and Other Similar Technologies.
We (or our third party service providers, which include advertising networks and other data brokers) use cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies to identify your browser or mobile device.
Like many services, Traverse uses these technologies to track visits to and across our Site, analyze trends, gather demographic information about our Site visitors (such as age range or zip code), and administer our Site.
We (or our service providers) may also use these technologies in connection with advertising of our services that may appear on other websites.
Our Site uses cookies, which are small text files that are stored on your computer or device when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and actions.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies.
If you delete your cookies or if you set your web browser to decline cookies, some features of the website and/or online services that you are using may not work or may not work as designed.
To learn more about cookies generally, and how to disable them, the Interactive Advertising Bureau provides more information at .
Mobile Device Information.
Other technologies may also be used for similar purposes as cookies and pixels on platforms where cookies are not available or applicable, such as mobile device identifiers for advertising.
Most modern mobile devices running Apple, Android, and Windows 10 (and above) operating systems provide mobile advertising identifiers.
Mobile operating systems come with options to reset these randomly-generated identifiers and limit targeted advertising across apps and online.
In addition to mobile device identifiers we may also collect device-specific information such as your operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, and unique device identifiers.
This helps us measure how the Site is performing and improve the Site for you on your particular device.
Third-party Tracking and Analytics.
We may use third-party data analytics services to evaluate your use of the Service, compile reports on activity, collect demographic data, analyze performance metrics, and collect and evaluate other information relating to the Service and mobile and Internet usage.
These third parties use cookies and other technologies as described above.
Cookies may also be placed in your browser by third-party advertising companies to help deliver the ads you see online.
These “third-party cookies” may be used to “remember” parts of your online activities in order to deliver ads tailored to your interests.
For example, if you read an article online reviewing a movie you wish to see, a cookie may be used to note your interest in movies and television.
As you continue to surf the web, you may see movie trailers and coupons to save money at movie theaters near you.
Please see “Your Choices…” below to learn about how to opt-out of targeted advertising.
Information Provided by Third Parties.
We may work with companies who provide similar or complementary services to us (such as data brokers, advertising networks, and businesses that provide goods or services to consumers) to identify new customers or provide joint products and services.
For example, we may co-host and webinar or event, and receive your personal information as a result of these interactions.
In such an event, we will treat this information in accordance with this policy.
How We Use the Information We Collect.
We use your Information, including the personal information you volunteer to us, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including as set forth above under “Information You Provide Us” and “Information Collected Automatically”.
In addition, we may use this information to provide, operate, manage, maintain and enhance our Site.
We may aggregate your Information with other information and use it for reporting, research and analysis purposes, or for any other purpose for which the information was collected.
Please see our Product Policy about how we use your information through our products and services.
Sharing Your Information.
We do not share personal information with third parties except for the limited circumstances set forth in this Privacy Policy and our Product Policy, including.
Clients.
Unless you opt out of the sale of your information, we may share certain information about our website visitors and information about you to our clients, including but not limited to personal identifiers, internet or other electronic network activity information, and inferences drawn from this information.
Our clients include advertising networks, data brokers, and providers of products and services.
This allows them to customize their websites or mobile applications, display personalized advertisements, perform marketing attribution analysis, or in the case of data brokers, to share your information with their clients for their advertising purposes.
To learn more about how we share your information through our products and services, please visit our Product Policy.
Service Providers and Partners.
We work with certain vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Site and other services by performing tasks on our behalf.
These services include, but are not limited to, lead validation, industry engagement, marketing and analytics.
These entities may have access to your Information (including your personal information) to help them perform these business functions.
For example, allowing us to respond to your questions and provide you information about Traverse products and services.
Additionally, we may also share information with social networking (such as through a Facebook “Like” button) and other sites, applications or partners, for marketing and advertising our products or services on those sites and applications.
Generally, these third parties do not have the right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
We use commercially reasonable efforts to contractually obligate these third parties to only use your personal Information as necessary to provide us with their services, and to adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information.
We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly, including with users, partners or the press in order to, for example, demonstrate how Traverse benefits our clients, spot industry trends, or provide marketing materials for Traverse.
Any aggregated information shared this way will not contain any information that can be used to identify you, or allow a third party to contact you directly (for example your name or email address).
Change of Control.
In the event that all or a portion of Traverse or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third party, or in any other situation where personal information that we have collected would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third party, we may disclose, share or transfer the information.
You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website within thirty (30) days of any change of control or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
Under such circumstances we would use commercially reasonable efforts to require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, but we cannot guarantee that an acquiring company or the merged company will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy.
Legal Requirements.
We may also use or disclose your Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with valid legal process.
(b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Service or our clients, and (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of us, our affiliates, agents, our clients, or the public.
Data Security and Retention.
The security of your personal information is important to us.
We use commercially reasonable security measures to protect your Information, both during transmission and once we receive it.
Although we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our information systems, no method of transmission or safeguard is 100% immune.
Therefore we cannot guarantee the security of your Information.
We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfil the purposes outlined in the Privacy Policy and our Product Privacy Policy.
We we will not keep non-aggregated Information for longer than one (1) year unless a longer retention period is required, requested contractually by our clients, or is required or permitted by law.
