If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
If you choose not to provide your personal information to us for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, we may not be able to undertake certain activities for you such as providing you with requested information or products or services.
Disclosure of personal information.
dorsaVi will not otherwise disclose your personal information without your permission, unless the disclosure is.
In accordance with this Privacy Notice or any agreement you enter into with us.
or.
Required or authorised by law, including without limitation under the Acts, the GDPR and HIPAA.
dorsaVi may disclose, or provide access to, your personal information to third parties in connection with the purposes described in 3(b) of dorsaVi’s Privacy Notice.

For customers and other data subjects located in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’), your personal information will be transferred outside the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).
dorsaVi, its Related Entities and some of our third-party service providers may be based outside of the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your personal information out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented.
We transfer personal information pursuant to binding corporate rules of dorsaVi and its Related Entities.
We use specific contracts, or data protection clauses, which have been adopted or approved by the Information Commissioner’s Office or the European Commission which give personal information the same protection it has in Europe.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer information to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal information shared between the Europe and the US.
Please email if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal information out of the EEA.

Security of personal information.
Irrespective of whether personal information is stored electronically or in hard copy form, dorsaVi will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
However, except to the extent liability cannot be excluded due to the operation of statute, we exclude all liability for the consequences of any unauthorised access.
In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents and contractors who have a business need to know.
They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Information Retention.
We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Accessing and updating your personal information and further information.
Under certain circumstances, you will have certain rights in relation to your personal information, including to give you the right to access or correct your personal information.
In certain circumstances, as set out in the Privacy Laws we may not be required by law to provide you with access or to correct your personal information.
If that is the case, we will give you our reasons for that decision to the extent that it is reasonable to do so.
We take reasonable steps to make sure that the personal information we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up-to-date.
You have the right to.
Request access to your personal information.
This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you.
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal information.
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
You also have the right to ask us to delete, deidentify,  or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase or deidentify your personal information to comply with local law.
Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal information.
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios.
(a) if you want us to establish the information’s accuracy.
(b) where our use of the information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
(c) where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
or (d) you have objected to our use of your information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party.
We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time.
where we are relying on consent to process your personal information.
However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.
We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
No Fee Usually Required.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights listed in clause 7).
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What We May Need From You.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights).
This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our responses.
Time Limit To Respond.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 1 month.
Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.
In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
