The following data protection policy is to inform users of the website  about the character, scope and purposes of personal data that is processed by the responsible provider, MING Labs GmbH.
It also applies to the provider's external online presences such as social media profiles, and regardless of the used domains, systems, platforms and devices on which this website is run.
With regard to the terms used, such as "personal data", "user" or "processing", we refer to Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Personal data of users is processed solely in accordance with the relevant data protection regulations.
Based on Article 13 GDPR, we inform you about the legal basis of our data processing operations.
Unless the legal basis is specified within this data privacy policy, the following shall apply.
The legal basis for the processing of personal data with separate consent are Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7 GDPR.
The legal basis for the processing of data in order to fulfill our services and to execute contractual measures is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.
The legal basis for the processing of personal data in order to fulfill our legal obligations is Article 6(1)(c) GDPR.
The legal basis for the processing of personal data in order to preserve our legitimate interests is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Personal data may only be transferred to third parties based on legal permissions and within the legal requirements.
We only transfer user data to third parties as long as this is, e.
g.
, based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, required for contractual purposes, or when we make use of services within our legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR).
Provided that third parties are engaged in the processing of personal data under a "Data Processing Agreement", this happens on the basis of Article 28 GDPR.
As far as we make use of third-party services in order to provide our own services, we take appropriate measures to ensure the protection of personal data according to the relevant legal requirements.
This may include the transfer of personal data to servers outside the EU or to trusted third parties located outside the EU in order to process this data on our behalf.
Be aware that many countries do not offer the same legal protection of personal data as is the case within the EU.
While your personal information resides in another country, courts, prosecution and national security authorities of the respective country can access your data in accordance with its laws.
Subject to such legitimate requests for access, we promise that everybody involved in the processing of your personal information outside the EU has to take measures in order to protect them and is only allowed to process them in accordance with our instructions and applicable EU law.
We therefore only allow data to be processed in a third country provided that the specific preconditions of Article 44 ff.
GDPR apply.
This means that data processing happens, e.
g.
, based on special guarantees such as an officially acknowledged assessment in conformity with the EU's level of data privacy, based on compliance with specific contractual obligations (so-called "standard contractual clauses") or based on binding corporate rules in accordance with a certain consistency mechanism and further requirements.
What personal data we collect.
For questions and matters of any kind, you have a number of options to contact us (e.
g.
, via email, phone or our social media channels).
When doing so, the data and information provided by the person contacting us will be processed as far as this is necessary to reply to a specific request.
This can include personal data such as name, address, email address, phone number, but also content data such as images, videos or text input.
The processing of data for the purpose of making contact with us is carried out in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest), and if applicable, in order to fulfill contractual purposes or take precontractual measures (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).
Subject to your explicit agreement as per Article 6(1)(a) GDPR, we use your email address to send you our newsletter on a regular basis.
In case that the content of the newsletter is specifically described during the course of the subscription to the newsletter, this information is decisive for the user's consent.
Apart from that, our newsletters provide information on our products, services, promotions and our company.
To receive our newsletter, a valid email address is required.
For newsletter subscriptions, we make use of the so-called double opt-in procedure, i.
e.
, we will send a newsletter to your email address only after you have explicitly agreed to the activation of our newsletter service.
To do so, we will send you a notification email asking you to confirm that you wish to receive our newsletter by clicking on a corresponding link provided in the notification email.
With subscribing to our newsletter, we store your IP address and the subscription date in order to be able to prove your subscription.
You can withdraw your consent to receiving our newsletter at any time.
You can do this either via a corresponding link in the newsletter itself or by sending us a message to the email address stated above.
For managing and sending our newsletter, we use "MailChimp", a newsletter publishing platform by US provider The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.
The email addresses of our newsletter subscribers and further types of data described here are stored by MailChimp on their servers in the USA.
MailChimp uses this information to send and evaluate the newsletter on our behalf.
In addition to that and according to their own admission, MailChimp can make further use of this data in order to optimize or improve their own services, e.
g.
, for technical optimization of newsletter submission and/or display, or for economic purposes in order to determine the countries that subscribers are from.
MailChimp, however, does not use subscribers' data to send own emails nor to provide the data to third parties.
The newsletters contain a so-called "web beacon".
This is a pixel-sized file which is called from MailChimp's server when the newsletter is being opened.
Within this call, first of all, technical information such as information on your browser and system as well as your IP address and date/time of your newsletter call are collected.
This information serves to technically improve MailChimp's services based on technical data, or on target groups and their reading behavior based on access locations (which can be identified through the IP addresses) or access times.
The collection of statistics also includes assessing if and when newsletters are being opened, and which links are clicked.
For technical reasons, this information can be attributed to the individual newsletter subscribers, but it is neither our nor MailChimp's ambition to monitor individual users.
The evaluations rather serve to learn about our subscribers' reading habits and to adjust our newsletter content accordingly.
MailChimp has contractually committed itself to transfer and process all data of its users from Switzerland, the EU and the UK in accordance with the standard contractual clauses of the EU.
Please visit  and  for further information and to learn more about Mailchimp's privacy policy.
On our website, we provide an online job application form.
Your personal data such as your name, email address, location as well as further application data is collected and used in order to handle the application process.
Legal basis for the processing of this data is Article 26(1)(1) of the Federal Data Protection Act in connection with Article 88(1) GDPR.
We use Personio, an HR and application management software provided by Personio GmbH, Rundfunkplatz 4, 80335 München, Germany, to manage and handle the application process.
In case the application process does not result in an employment, your data will automatically be deleted after 90 days.
unless legal provisions (e.
g.
, burden of proof pursuant to the General Act on Equal Treatment) require a longer storage period in accordance with the statuatory periods.
Legal basis for this are Article 6(1)(f) GDPR and §24(1)(2) of the Federal Data Protection Act.
In case that you have explicitly agreed to a longer storage period (e.
g.
, pool of candidates), we process your data based on your given consent in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.
You can withdraw your consent at anytime with effect for the future (Article 7(3) GDPR).
In case the application process results in an employement, we will continue to store the application data provided by you in our HR management software/your personnel record in order to organize, manage and execute the employment relationship in accordance with further applicable legal requirements.
Legal basis for the processing of this data is Article 88(1) GDPR.
If you send us an application per email, your data is processed accordingly.
Deletion of the emails happens on a regular basis.
