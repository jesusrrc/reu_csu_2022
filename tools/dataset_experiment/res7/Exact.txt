Protection of Your Personal Data.
Exact undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of the Personal Data, preferences and other information it has collected through this Site and will never knowingly allow access to this information to anyone outside Exact other than as described herein.

Your Exact username and any password (if such is provided or enacted) are confidential, and we recommend that you not divulge them to anyone.
Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Internet as a public transmission network, neither Exact’s network nor data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect Personal Data that is transmitted to us by you, Exact cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.
Thus, any Personal Data transmitted to us is done so at your own risk.
Once we receive Personal Data, Exact undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of this information consistent with this Privacy Statement.
