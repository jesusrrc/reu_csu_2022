ABOUT US.
From Sound Waves toSensewaves.
OUR STORY.
We’ve been researching and developing ground breaking sound waves analysis and human computer interaction solutions at IRCAM – the world’s leading scientific sound research institute – for more than 15 year now.
The knowledge we’ve gained along the way has allowed us to conceive, develop and produce our own unique approach for extracting information from sound waves.
By combining innovative sound analysis algorithms and machine learning techniques with custom, time-series indexing schemas, our approach transforms complex sound waves into sound information that’s incredibly meaningful for the user.
We created Sensewaves because we saw that our unique approach would be as valuable for extracting meaningful information from IoT streams as it does from sound waves.
Based in France, our team of highly qualified and passionate individuals share a common guiding philosophy.
a commitment to providing Energy & Utilities companies with the first Adaptive Analytics platform – a platform designed to meet not only the data needs of today … but also tomorrow.
