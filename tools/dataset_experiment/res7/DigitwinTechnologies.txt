Digital Privacy Policy.
Thank you for  visiting the Department of the Commerce website and reviewing our privacy  policy.
How we handle information we learn about you from your visit to our  website depends upon what you do when visiting our site.
Please be assured that  the privacy of our visitors is of utmost importance to us.
We collect no  personally identifiable information about you when you visit our site unless  you choose to provide that information to us.

Digital Privacy Policy.
The E-Government Act requires that agencies develop and post on agency websites digital privacy  notices consistent with those required for systems of records under the Privacy  Act.
The Digital Privacy Policy is a general notice on an agency website  explaining agency information handling practices.
OMB Memoranda M-03-22 and M-10-22 identify the content that must be included in the notice.
The  Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) is responsible for the development  and maintenance of privacy policies, procedures, and guidance essential to  safeguarding the collection, access, use, dissemination, and storage of  personally identifiable information (PII) and Privacy Act information.
The  Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) conducts regular and systematic  reviews of operating unit websites to ensure that the Department of Commerce  (DOC) Web Privacy Policy is appropriately addressed.
Digital  Privacy is the protection of personally identifiable or business identifiable information that is collected from respondents through information collection activities or from other sources and that is maintained by the DOC in its information technology (IT) systems.
For purposes of this policy, this information is termed “identifiable information.
” Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, consistent with the E-Government Act of 2002, protects personally identifiable information (PII).
Commerce, through this policy, is extending the same protection to business identifiable information (BII).
Rapid advancements in computer technology make it possible to store and retrieve vast amounts of data of all kinds quickly and efficiently.
These advancements have raised concerns about the impact of IT systems on the privacy of individuals and businesses.
The Department of Commerce is committed to protecting identifiable information collected from individuals and businesses to the extent permitted by law.
Commerce will treat all identifiable information with fairness and respect, and ensure its integrity reflective of the stewardship responsibility for the information entrusted to it.
To address these concerns, DOC has adopted the following privacy principles.
Data Minimization.
DOC will collect the minimal amount of information necessary from individuals and businesses consistent with the Department’s mission and legal requirements.
Transparency.
Notice covering the purpose of the collection and use of identifiable information will be provided in a clear manner.
Information collected will not be used for any other purpose unless authorized or mandated by law.
Accuracy.
Information collected will be maintained in a sufficiently accurate, timely, and complete manner to ensure that the interests of the individuals and businesses are protected.
Security.
Adequate physical and IT security measures will be implemented to ensure that the collection, use, and maintenance of identifiable information is properly safeguarded and the information is promptly destroyed in accordance with approved records control schedules.
Back to Top.
Machine Readable Privacy Policy.
The E-Government Act also requires that agencies adopt machine readable technology that alerts users automatically about whether the site privacy practices match their personal privacy preferences so they can make an informed choice about whether to conduct business with that site.
Privacy policy in standardized machine-readable format means a statement about site privacy practices written in a standard computer language (not English text) that can be read automatically by a Web browser.
In addition to having the Digital Privacy Policy in machine-readable format, OMB encourages agencies to adopt other privacy protection tools that become available as the technology advances.
