2 Cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologiesWe use cookies and similar technologies such as web beacons, tags and Javascript alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about the usage of our websites and interaction with emails from us.
When you visit our websites, our servers or an authorized third party may place a cookie on your browser, which can collect information, including Personal Data, about your online activities over time and across different sites.
Cookies allow us to track overall usage, determine areas that you prefer, make your usage easier by recognizing you and providing you with a customized experience.
We use both session-based and persistent cookies.
Session cookies exist only during one session and disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer or device after you close your browser or turn off your computer.
You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our websites or services.
To opt-out from tracking by Google Analytics, please use the specific opt-out mechanism as indicated further below.
We also use web beacons on our websites.
For example, we may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of our websites.
Such such tracking technologies are used to operate and improve our websites and email communications and track the clicking of links or opening of emails.
The following sets out how we use different categories of cookies and similar technologies, as well as information on your options for managing the settings for the data collected by these technologies.
Type of Cookies.
Description.
Managing Settings.
Required cookies.
Required cookies enable you to navigate our websites and use their features, such as accessing secure areas of the websites.
If you have chosen to identify yourself to us, we may place on your browser a cookie that allows us to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the websites and to process your online transactions and requests.
Because required cookies are essential to operate the websites there is no option to opt out of these cookies.
Functional cookies.
Functional cookies allow us to remember information you have entered or choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region) and provide enhanced, more personal features.
Functional cookies may also be used to improve how our websites function and to help us provide you with more relevant messages, including marketing communications.
These cookies collect information about how our websites are used, including which pages are viewed most often.
We may use our own technology or third party technology to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information to provide enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of our advertisements.
In particular, we use Google Analytics ("Google Analytics"), a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.
, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA as our processor.
Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how our websites are used, including the number of visitors, the websites visitors have come from, and the pages they visit.
This information is used by us to improve our websites.
To manage the use of functional cookies on our websites, consult your individual browser settings for cookies.
Note that opting out may impact the functionality you receive when using our websites.
To opt out from data collection by Google Analytics, you can download and install a browser add-on, which is available here.

Targeting or Advertising cookies.
We sometimes uses cookies delivered by us or third parties to show you ads for our products that we think may interest you on any devices you may use and to track the performance of our advertisements.
For example, in these cases, cookies may collect and remember information such as which browsers have visited our websites.
The information provided to third parties does not include Personal Data, but this information may be re-associated with Personal Data after the Company receives it.
MICHELIN Connected Fleet also contracts with third party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons (see below) on our websites, from emails, and on third-party websites.
Advertising networks follow your online activities over time and across different sites or other online services by collecting device and usage data through automated means, including through the use of cookies.
These technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use, such as a desktop or laptop computer, smartphone or tablet.
Third parties use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests.
You may see their advertisements on other websites or mobile applications on any of your devices.
This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
See Section 4.
3, below, to learn more about these and other advertising networks and your ability to opt out of collection by certain third parties.

3 Notices on behavioural advertising and opt-outAs described above, we or third parties may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser when you visit our websites for the purposes of serving you targeted advertising (also referred to as “online behavioral advertising” or “interest-based advertising”).
To manage the use of targeting or advertising cookies on this website, consult your individual browser settings for cookies.

4 Opt-Out from the collection of device and usage dataYou may opt-out from the collection of device and usage data (see ""What device and usage data we process"" section above) by managing your cookies at the individual browser level.
In addition, if you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising click here.
Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies and similar technologies used on our websites, you may not be able to take full advantage of the website.
While some internet browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, these features are not yet uniform and there is no common standard that has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators.
Therefore, we do not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to our websites.
MICHELIN Connected Fleet takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
