Privacy Policy.
Your privacy is important to WINSYSTEMS, Inc.
, and its related companies (collectively, “WINSYSTEMS”).
This Privacy Policy provides important details regarding the various types of information about you that might be collected when you use any of our websites, how that information might be used, with whom it might be shared, and how it will be protected.
By accessing or using WINSYSTEMS websites, you consent to our use of your information as described below, and you agree to this Privacy Policy and to WINSYSTEMS’ Terms of Use, as well as any subsequent updates of those documents.
You should read both documents carefully.
INFORMATION ABOUT YOU THAT WE COLLECT OR OBTAIN Online Form.
Our “Contact” page contains an online form you can use to request further information about how our products or services might benefit your company.
When you submit information through that form, you provide us with personally identifiable information about yourself—your name, email address, and possibly your phone number if you provide your own—as well as your company name, state, and country.
By completing that form, you may be added to our newsletter mailing list and receive information from us from time to time.
You may unsubscribe at any time.
Submission of your personally identifiable information, and any other information, through that form is purely voluntary and by your action and consent—you are not required to submit such information in order to visit and use our websites, nor will you be signed up for any mailing list simply by visiting and using our websites.
To submit your information, you are required to check the box at the bottom agreeing with the storage and handling of your data by our website.
Cookies.
Cookies are small text files that a website transfers to the visitor’s hard drive or web browser, and they are used to improve the visitor’s experience when using our websites, such as retaining user preferences between sessions.
Cookies cannot be used to deliver viruses to your computer, and they can only be read by our web servers.
Most web browsers give you the option to decline cookies selectively or completely.
Web Beacons.
A web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than onepixel square, that is placed on a website to monitor the activity of a visitor while using the website, often used in combination with cookies.
Like cookies, web beacons cannot be used to deliver viruses to your computer.
Web beacons help us learn which pages of our websites are visited, how often, and for how long.
Technical Information.
When you visit any website, including any of our websites, certain information is collected automatically, including your internet protocol or IP addresses, unique device identifiers, the type of browser you are using, and other technical data about your computing environment (collectively, “Technical Information”).
You should understand that it is possible for website publishers to combine such Technical Information with information provided by third parties to identify you specifically and learn more about you.
WINSYSTEMS does not do that.
As discussed further below, WINSYSTEMS only uses Technical Information for anonymous metrics.
Links.
Our websites might contain links to other websites not under our control.

When you send us an email, we might use your email address to send you newsletters or other emails.
Again, you may unsubscribe at any time.

But, except as disclosed herein, your personally identifiable information will not be shared with third parties other than our Web Vendor, our CRM hosting service, and our advertising partners, and will not be sold to, or used by, any third parties to market their products or services to you.
We use cookies, web beacons, and the Technical Information described above as part of developing anonymous statistical reporting on aggregate website-usage data, and that anonymous information might be shared with third parties (such as providers of web analytics services), but we do not use that information to discover additional personally identifiable information about you.
The WINSYSTEMS family of companies, including our subsidiaries and affiliates, share your information internally for a variety of purposes, including marketing and promotion of our products and services, evaluation of potential job candidates, and providing information to existing or potential investors (although investment decisions should be made solely based on formal disclosures such as our prospectuses and public filings, not on information provided on or through our websites).
