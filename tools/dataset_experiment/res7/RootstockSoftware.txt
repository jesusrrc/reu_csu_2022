Glossary.
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device.
When used in “local storage” mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions.
This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened.
One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website.
When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser.
Cookies may store user preferences and other information.
You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.
A pixel or pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened.
Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
An application data cache is a data repository on a device.
It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Interest-based advertising are sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads.
Interest-based ads are used to display features, products, and services that might be of interest to the user.
To serve interest-based ads, we may use information such as your interactions with our Platform, Services and related content.
We do not use information which on its own identifies you, such as name or e-mail address, to serve interest-based ads.
As is common in the advertising industry, we use cookies, pixels, and other technologies which enable us to understand the effectiveness of the interest-based ads we show you by measuring what ads are clicked or viewed, and to provide you with more useful and relevant ads.
For example, if we know what ads are shown to your browser we can be careful not to show the same ads repeatedly.
We work with third parties, such as advertisers, publishers, social media networks, search engines, ad serving companies, and advertising companies working on their behalf, to improve the relevance of ads we serve.
Advertisers and other third parties may assume or infer that users who interact with or click on an interest-based ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in a particular geographical area or users who purchased or browsed for classical music).
Third party advertisers or advertising companies working on their behalf sometimes use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads, directly to your browser or device, and they may automatically receive an IP address when this happens.
They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, show you more relevant advertising content, and perform services on behalf of Rootstock.
Server logs.
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites.
These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
Session replay provides the ability to replay a visitor’s journey on a web site or within a mobile application or web application.
Replay can include the user’s view (browser or screen output), user input (keyboard and mouse inputs), and logs of network events or console logs.
Session replay is used to help improve customer experience, analyze usability and help identify obstacles in conversion processes on websites.
It can also be used to study a website’s usability, customer behavior, interests, and the handling of customer service questions as the customer journey, with all interactions, can be replayed.
It can also be used to analyze fraudulent behavior on websites.
A Unique Identifier is a string of letters, numbers and characters that can be used to uniquely identify a computer, device, personal device, browser or app.
Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique Identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing data from your device(s) to our Platform, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising.
You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
See your browser documentation for additional information.
On other platforms besides browsers (e.
g.
, personal devices), Unique Identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device.
For example, a Unique Identifier can be used to provide relevant advertising on mobile devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings.
Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a Device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone.
For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our Platform and Services to your device or analyze device issues related to our Platform and Services.
