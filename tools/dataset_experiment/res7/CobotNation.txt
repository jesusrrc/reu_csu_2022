Newsletter.
With the email newsletter we inform you about us and our services.
For the registration to the newsletter only your email address is needed.
If you register for the newsletter, your email address will be transmitted to us (or to Mailchimp) and stored there.
After registration, the user receives an email to confirm the registration (“double opt-in”).
With the registration for the newsletter the IP address, the device name, the mail provider as well as (optional) the first and last name and the date of the registration are stored with us.
This storage serves solely as proof in the event that a third party misuses an email address and registers for receiving the newsletter without the knowledge of the authorised party.
The data processing for sending the newsletter is based on your consent (legal basis.
Art.
6 (1) a.
GDPR).
If you purchase goods or services from us, we may in future send you information emails for similar goods or services.
Data processing will be based on the business relationship with you (legal basis.
Art.
6 (1) b.
GDPR or German Unfair Competition Act (UWG)).
We use “Mailchimp”, a service of Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA, for the purpose of sending out newsletters.
For this purpose, the service processes the IP address, device name, mail provider, first and last name and date on Mailchimp’s servers in the USA.
We use the Mailchimp service to analyze the behavior of users, such as whether they open the email sent or click certain links in E-Mails.
When the newsletter is opened, the contained information (so-called web-beacon) connects to the servers of Mailchimp in the USA in order to analyse the behaviour of the user.
Further technical information such as the IP address, browser type and operating system are collected for this purpose.
Data processing is carried out on the legal basis of art.
6 (1) f.
GDPR, whereby our legitimate interests (or the legitimate interests of third parties commissioned by us) in quality assurance or marketing are pursued.
We would also like to point out that the integration of Mailchimp may lead to automated decision making including “profiling”.
Mailchimp is obliged according to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, i.
e.
an agreement with us referring to the compliance with certain data protection standards, to comply with data protection standards comparable to the standards in the EU.
For more information please refer to.
.
Mailchimp’s data protection regulations can be found here.
.
The user can withdraw their consent to the processing of data for the purpose of sending the newsletter or evaluation by Mailchimp/us at any time.
The withdrawal can take place over a link, which is contained in each newsletter, or by separate message to us.
You will not incur any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic tariffs.

Legal basis of data processing.
The processing of data when using our offer is generally based on the legal basis of art.
6 (1) b.
GDPR, i.
e.
the data will be processed, when this is necessary for the fulfilment of the contract between you and us or for the execution of pre-contractual measures that take place on your request.
Furthermore, we can process data pursuant to art.
6 (1) a.
GDPR if you have given your consent to the processing of your personal data for certain purposes, e.
g.
for receiving our newsletter.
In special cases, we may also process your data according to art.
6 (1) c.
GDPR if processing is required to fulfil a legal obligation to which we or other responsible parties are subject, or pursuant to art.
6 (1) e.
GDPR, if processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, which has been delegated to us or to the responsible party.
In addition, art.
6 (1) f.
GDPR is applicable if the processing is necessary to protect our legitimate interests or those of a third party and does not outweigh your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, which require the protection of personal data – as is the case for data collection in connection with the visits to our Website or a transfer of data to our shareholders or service providers.
A legitimate interest exists, if a significant and appropriate relationship between you (or the data subject) and us (or the person responsible) exists, e.
g.
if the person concerned is our customer or user of a service or is in his service.
Please also refer to the information provided in the description of processing operations in this Privacy Policy.

7.
Profiling and automated decision-making.
We do not use profiling or automated decision-making when processing data concerning our Offer.
however, our third party providers may carry out such profiling in individual cases, whereby we refer to it in this data protection guideline, as far as possible.
Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which has legal effect on him/her or substantially impairs him/her in a similar manner.
This shall not apply where the decision (i) is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between the data subject and the person responsible, (ii) is admissible under the laws of the European Union or of the member state to which the person responsible is subject and where such laws contain appropriate measures to safeguard the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject, or (iii) is taken with the explicit consent of the data subject.
In these exceptional cases, the person responsible shall take appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms and the legitimate interests of the data subject, including at least the right to obtain an action by the person responsible, to state his own position and to challenge the decision.

8.
Data Processing Agreement.
If legally required, we will enter into a data processing agreement (pursuant to GDPR) with our customers as parties of and as defined in the Terms of Service.
2.
Will data be passed on to third parties.
We only transfer personal data to third parties if this is necessary for the execution of the Service and as described in this privacy policy.
Data will only be transferred if we are legally authorised or obliged to do so, if the respective data subject has given his/her consent and has not withdrawn it and/or if this is necessary to enforce our rights.
This applies, in particular, if we are legally obliged to transfer personal data (legal basis.
Art.
6 (1) c.
GDPR).

What kind of services and services of third parties do we use.
3.
1.
Integration of third-party services and content.
It is possible that third party content, such as videos from YouTube, maps material from Google Maps, RSS feeds or graphics from other websites are included in the Offer.
This always presupposes that the providers of this content (“Third Party Providers”) perceive the IP address of the users.
Without the IP address, they would not be able to send the content to the user’s browser.
The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content.
As far as possible, we will only use content whose respective Third Party Providers explicitly limit the use the IP address to deliver the content.
However, we have no influence on the processing of data by Third Party Providers, e.
g.
in case of storage of the user’s IP address for statistical purposes.
As far as we gain knowledge of such data processing, we inform the users accordingly.

2.
Cookies.
Cookies are small files that allow the storage of specific information, concerning the users device, on the user’s device (PC, smartphone, etc.

In addition, they are used to collect the statistical data on the use of the Website and to analyse the data to improve the Website.
Users can influence the use of cookies.
Most browsers have an option that restricts or completely prevents cookies from being stored.
However, in this case, the use and in particular the comfort of use of the Website is restricted.
When visiting the Website, so-called session cookies are used, which are automatically deleted from the user’s hard disk as soon as the user closes the browser window.
The session cookies are required in order to allocate successive page views to the respective users who simultaneously access the platform.

are usually transmitted to and stored by Google on a server in the United States, although due to the activation of IP anonymization on the Website, the IP address of Google’s users will be shortened in advance within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states to the agreement on the European Economic Area.
The full IP address is therefore not transferred to a Google server in the USA and is not shortened there.
IP anonymization is active on the Website.
On our behalf, Google will use the collected data to evaluate the use of the Website by users, to compile reports on Website activity and to provide us with further services related to the use of offers and the Internet.

however, we hereby inform you that in this case you, may not be able to use all functions of the Website in full.
Users can also prevent Google from collecting and processing the data generated by the cookie (including the IP address) and related to the use of our Offer by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link.
