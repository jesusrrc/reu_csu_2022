Privacy Statement.
MultiTech respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the personal information you share with us.
You can travel through most of our site without giving us any information about yourself.
But sometimes we do need information to provide you with the services that you request.
This statement of privacy explains our data collection and use in those situations.
Information Collection.
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, occupation, business type, industry, product purchase preference, billing information, credit card information, and any other information when needed to provide a service you requested.
When you browse our website, you do so anonymously.
We don't collect personal information, including your email address.
We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there.
If you send us an email, we may link your IP address to any personal information you provide in that email.
MultiTech collects personal information when you inquire about "where to buy" our products, ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, use our online ordering services, submit an entry for a sweepstakes or other promotion, or when you submit your information to MultiTech for any other reason.
Choice.
MultiTech will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing information.
This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Policy.
In some cases, when applicable, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in.
" This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.
How We Use Information Collected.
MultiTech uses information for several general purposes.
to complete a transaction or order, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about from us.
Occasionally we may also use your information to contact you for market research regarding MultiTech products or services.
We will give you the opportunity to opt-out of market research and customer surveys.
Credit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention, and is not used for other purposes.
Information Sharing and Disclosure.
Because MultiTech is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other MultiTech offices or subsidiaries around the world.
All such entities are governed by this Privacy Policy and/or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data transfer agreements.
We take seriously the trust you place in us.
MultiTech will not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to others.
Security.
MultiTech is committed to ensuring the security of your information when you purchase from our e-commerce site.
We use SSL encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information.
Credit card numbers are only used for processing payment and are not used for other purposes.
Our efforts to protect credit card fraud help protect your financial data security.
Your Ability to Delete Your Information.
You may request deletion of your personal information held by us by sending an email to our marketing team.
Third Party Sites.

MultiTech does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices.
We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.
Changes to this Privacy Policy.
MultiTech will amend this Policy from time to time.
If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will make that information available by posting a notice on this site.
