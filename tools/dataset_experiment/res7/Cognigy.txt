The basic personal data is your name.
In addition, your gender, date of birth, address, occupation, e-mail address and IP address are also considered personal data.
Non-personal data, on the other hand, is data with which the determination of your actual identity is impossible or at least requires considerable effort.
This includes, for example, the aforementioned information if we receive it anonymously and therefore cannot assign it to any natural person.
3.
This section is intentionally left blank.
4.

1For the use of the Cognigy websites, the provision of personal data is neither required by law nor by contract and is also not required for the conclusion of a contract.

However, you will not be able to visit the Cognigy Websites without the transmission of the IP address you are using.
4.
2In order to use interactive functions of the Cognigy websites (e.
g.

We use the personal data provided by you exclusively for the purposes stated in this privacy policy or expressly agreed with you.
5.
3We contracted various service providers to support us in the provision, operation and maintenance of our IT systems, including the Cognigy websites.
These include, for example, hardware, web services and software suppliers,, hosting providers or data centers.
When such service providers work for us, they may be given access to your personal data as recipients.
However, these service providers are then contractually obliged to comply with data protection by means of a so-called order processing agreement.
the statutory provisions on data protection also apply to our service providers anyway.

Anything to the contrary shall only apply if this is necessary for the execution of the notified or agreed purposes and is permitted under applicable data protection law without consent, if you have expressly given your consent or if we are legally obliged to do so.
Section 5.
3 remains unaffected and applies independently of this section 5.
