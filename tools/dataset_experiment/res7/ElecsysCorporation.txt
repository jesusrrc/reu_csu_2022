Privacy Notice.
PRIVACY NOTICE.
Last Updated.
June 4, 2018.
INTRODUCTION.
Lindsay Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Lindsay”) collect Personal Data (as defined below) in the context of providing Services (as defined below).
This Privacy Notice (this “Notice”) applies to individuals who use any website, application (“app”), product, software, or service of ours that hyperlinks to this Notice (our “Services”).
Lindsay respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your Personal Data.
If you use our Services, this Notice describes how we will collect, hold, store, protect, and use your Personal Data.
Depending on the Service, we may provide additional or different privacy statements or notices for specific interactions you have with us or to highlight how we use your Personal Data for specific Services.
Where we do this, it will be clear which statements apply to which interactions and Services.
For example, if you use one of our mobile apps, we may provide you a separate notice in relation to a particular data type collected through that app.
If you are a “Data Subject” under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), this is a required notice to you.
Lindsay is a “Data Controller” for purposes of this Notice.
This means that we are responsible for deciding how we collect, hold, and process your Personal Data.
It is important that you read this Notice, together with any other privacy notice we may provide on specific occasions, when we are collecting or processing your Personal Data.
CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13.
Our Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.
If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us.
CONTACT DETAILS.
If you have any questions about this Notice or how we handle your Personal Data, please provide such questions to the following email address.
.
WHAT PERSONAL DATA DO WE COLLECT.
All the Personal Data we may collect, both from you and from third parties about you, is outlined in the table below.
Before you read that table, it might be useful to explain what “Personal Data” is.
The GDPR definition of Personal Data can be found here.
Essentially, it boils down to.
information about an individual, from which that individual is either directly identified or can be identified.
It does not include ‘anonymous data’ (i.
e.
, information where the identity of the individual has been permanently removed).
However, it does include ‘indirect identifiers’ or ‘pseudonymous data’ (i.
e.
, information which alone doesn’t identify an individual but, when combined with certain additional and reasonably accessible information, could be attributed to a particular person).
Category of Personal Data Collected.
What this means.
Identity Data.
First name, last name, job title, job function, employer, marital status and gender (inferred from your title), contact type, username, or similar identifier.
Contact Data.
Business phone number, mobile phone number, home phone number, business facsimile number, business email address, personal email address, alternate email address, business mailing address, zip code or similar, state/province, country.
Marketing and Communications Data.
Your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communications preferences, including your preferred language for such communications.
Behavioral Data.
Inferred or assumed information relating to your behavior and interests based on your online activities.
This may including information on whether you have filled out a form on our website, whether you have downloaded materials (e.
g.
, whitepapers, ebooks, case studies, etc.
) from our website, your activity related to emails we send you (such as “opens,” “clicks,” and “unsubscribes”), your website visit activity (pages visited, including pages on third party websites other than our websites and Services), and your event-related activity (e.
g.
, whether you have attended any trade shows or webinars we have sponsored, hosted, or otherwise been involved in).
Technical Data.
Internet protocol (IP) address, your login data (including user identification and password), browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access and use our Services.
We may also collect, use, and share “Aggregated Data” such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose.
Aggregated Data may be derived from your Personal Data, but once in aggregated form, it will not constitute Personal Data for the purposes of the GDPR because this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity.
However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your Personal Data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Data, which will be used in accordance with this Notice.
We do not collect any “Special Categories of Personal Data” about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data).
Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.
PURPOSES.
We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it as listed below, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
Depending on your role, Lindsay may process your Personal Data for one or more of the following purposes.

LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING.
In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your Personal Data, the GDPR requires us to ensure that we have a “legal basis” for that use.
Most commonly, we will rely on one of the following legal bases.
Contractual Necessity.
Where we need to perform a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.

Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (for example, preventing and detecting crime, and assisting police and other authorities with their investigations).
Vital Interests.
Where it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example, where we know or have reason to believe that you or another person may suffer harm).
In circumstances where you have a genuine choice as to whether we should process your Personal Data, we will ask you for your consent.
The method used to obtain your consent will depend on the scope and context of the processing that we propose.
IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA.
Where we need to process your Personal Data either to comply with law or to perform the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you.
For example, we may not be able to provide you with the functionalities of the Services (e.
g.
, setting up your account) or we may not be able to respond to or fulfill a request you make of us (e.
g.
, for demonstration of the Services).
