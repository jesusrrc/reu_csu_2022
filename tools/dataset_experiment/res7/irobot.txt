HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION.
We collect personal information from you, third parties, Apps, and certain Robots that are registered with us to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of the Service, to process and ship orders, to provide customer service, to communicate directly with you, to monitor and improve our Service, and to help us develop new products and services.
The categories of information we collect are as follows.
Information you provide.
We collect and store personal information such as your name, email address, username and password, shipping address, billing information, and phone number when you register for an iRobot account, shop online, sign up for offers, communicate with us, or otherwise use our Service.
Directly identifiable personal information (such as full name and email address) is stored separately from deidentified Robot data (described below), with access restricted to need-to-know.
If you register your Robot online or through mail or another registration means, we also collect information about your Robot, such as the Robot ID, serial number, or product code.
We may also collect personal information when you call us, send us an email, or provide us with comments, chat messages, and opinions on our Website or through our Service.
You acknowledge that iRobot cannot guarantee the privacy of personal information you choose to post publicly on the internet, including on iRobot’s website or social media pages.
Information we receive from third parties.
If you login to our Website or Apps through a third party social network or authentication service, these services will authenticate your identity and may share your personal information with us (such as your name, email address, and profile information).
Similarly, we may receive certain personal information if you interact with our accounts on a social network, such as by “Liking” or “Following.
” The data we receive from these third-party services is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network.
You should always review and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our Service.
We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, to process and ship orders, to provide customer service, and to communicate directly with you, to monitor and improve our Service, and to help us develop new products and services.
Information We Collect from Registered Robots Equipped with Smart Technology.
Some of our Robots are equipped with smart technology which allows the Robots to transmit data wirelessly to the Service.
Robot data is stored in a deidentified state (separated from identifiable information).
Robot and App usage data.
When you register your Robot with the iRobot App, we collect information about the Robot, such as a Robot name and device number, and information about the Robot and/or App usage, such as battery life and health.
Robot environment information.
Certain Robot models are equipped to collect information about the environment in which the Robot is deployed.
For example, the Robot may collect information about the level of dirt detection, the Wi-Fi signal strength in each location, and information about the robot's movement throughout the environment to create a location "map" of the Robot’s domain and the existence and type of objects (chair, desk, fridge etc.
) or obstacles encountered.
We will store the name you give your robot, as well as any "room names," "zone names," or other "custom" names you assign to the map created of the robot's domain.
App information.
Through the iRobot App, you may opt-in to connect your iRobot account with iRobot smart home partners.
Doing so will allow iRobot to scan your device for smart home apps in order to suggest smart home connections.
iRobot will not collect this information unless you opt-in, and you may opt-out at any time through the iRobot App.
Should you choose to opt-in, App , meaning the names of smart home partner apps you have downloaded, will be stored in a deidentified manner.
iRobot Beta Program.
You may opt-in to the iRobot Beta Program made available within the App, which enables additional experimental Robot and/or App functionality.
Certain features require additional data collection in order to support that particular feature.
Each feature in the Beta Program requires your opt-in permission to enable that functionality.
Any personal information required to support a Beta feature will be disclosed in the Beta Program section within the App at the time that the new Beta feature is released.
The information required to support that Beta feature will not be collected or used as part of the iRobot Beta Program unless you choose to participate.
Any information collected under this program is subject to the same or functionally similar physical, administrative, and technological safeguards as other information collected under normal Robot use.
Table 1 sets out more detailed information about the categories of personal information we may collect from you and your devices, and how we may use that information.
TABLE 1   PERSONAL INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM DEVICES.
[Other Personal Information] Comments, chat and opinions that you provide to us when you contact us directly, such as the content of any text messages or emails you send to us, or phone calls.
Our Robots do not transmit this information unless you register your Robot online and connect to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, or connect to the internet via another method.
It is possible to use our smart technology Robots without Wi-Fi or Bluetooth data transmission, simply by disconnecting your Wi-Fi or Bluetooth from the Robot or by never connecting it at all.
You may also choose through your settings in the App not to have map data transmitted to us.
