— USE OF COOKIES.
The SECO website uses “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience.
A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server.
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page.
For example, if you personalize SECO pages, or register with the SECO website or services, a cookie helps SECO to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses and so on.
When you return to the same SECO website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the SECO features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the SECO services or website.
SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.
SECO secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
SECO secures the personally identifiable information from MyWay Prepay meters and the information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
CHANGES TO THIS POLICY.
SECO will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect company and member feedback.
SECO encourages you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to be informed of how SECO is protecting your information.
