endiio GmbH has made every effort to implement the most wide-ranging measures possible in order to protect users.
Despite this, we recommend that users take measures to protect their equipment against computer viruses.
We take the protection of your data very seriously and want you to feel safe when visiting our website.
The following policy gives you an overview of how we ensure this protection, which type of data is collected for which purpose and how we process it.
Contacting us.
If you contact us by means of the form on the website, by email or by post (the address is listed below), your data will be stored to process the request and in case of follow-up questions.
We will not share this information without your consent.
We also use your information to improve our platform, to prevent or detect misuse of our website (further explained in the section “Cookies”).

Integration of services and content of third parties.
Sometimes content from third parties, such as videos from YouTube, maps from Google Maps, RSS feeds or graphics from other websites are included on our website.
This always presupposes that the providers of this content (hereinafter referred to as “third-party provider”) perceive the IP address of the users.
Because without an IP address, they wouldn’t be able to send the content to the browser of the respective user.
The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content.
We endeavor to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content.
However, we do not have any influence on the fact that third parties can, for example, save the IP address for statistical purposes.
If we are, however, informed about this, we will also inform our users.
Cookies.
As soon as you establish contact with us, we receive and store certain information.
Among other things we — like many other websites — make occasional and partial use of so-called cookies, and we receive certain information as soon as your web browser opens our website.
Cookies are specific identification markers which we transmit to your computer’s hard drive or other terminal equipment to enable our systems to recognize your device.

The Help function in your web browser shows you how to stop your browser from accepting, displaying or rejecting new cookies.
You may prevent the use of cookies, but you may not be able to fully use all features of this website.

The contents of the plug-in are then transmitted from the social network directly to your browser and incorporated on the website by it.
Please note that we have no influence on the extent of the data retrieved by the social networks with their plug-ins.
For information about the purpose and extent of the data retrieval by the social network concerned, and about the rights and settings possibilities for the protection of your private sphere, please refer to the data protection information provided by the social network in question.
