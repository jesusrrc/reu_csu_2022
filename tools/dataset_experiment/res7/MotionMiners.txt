LinkedIn Insight TagThis website uses the Insight tag from LinkedIn.
This service is provided by LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland.

Once a website visitor is registered with LinkedIn, we can analyze the key occupational data (e.

The IP addresses are shortened or (if they are used to reach LinkedIn members across devices) hashed (pseudonymized).
The direct identifiers of LinkedIn members are deleted by LinkedIn after seven days.
The remaining pseudonymized data will then be deleted within 180 days.
The data collected by LinkedIn cannot be assigned by us as a website operator to specific individuals.
