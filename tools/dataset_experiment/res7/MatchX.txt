Cookies.
The Website uses cookies.
Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.
Many websites and servers use cookies.
Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID.
A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.
It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored.
This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies.
A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
Through the use of cookies, the MatchX GmbH can provide the users of this Website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our Website can be optimized with the user in mind.
Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our Website users.
The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our Website.
The Website user that uses cookies, e.
g.
does not have to enter access data each time the Website is accessed, because this is taken over by the Website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system.
Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop.
The online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.
We also use analytics cookies to help us understand things like how long data subjects stay on our Website, what pages they find most useful, and how they arrived at our website.
To do so we use the services of Google Analytics (see section 12).
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our Website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs.
This is possible in all popular Internet browsers.
If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our Website may be entirely usable.
Data processing when Visiting the Website.
The Website collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the Website.

An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under  During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.
If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject.
This information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject.
If the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.
g.
the "Like" button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.
Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website.
This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not.
If such a transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.
The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at  provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook.
In addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject.
In addition, different configuration options are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook.
These applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.
On this Website, we have integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function).
Google Analytics is a web analytics service.
Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites.
A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed.
Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.

Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, hereinafter collectively "Google").
For the web analytics through Google Analytics we use the application "_gat.
_anonymizeIp".
By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our Website from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.
Any transfer to a country outside the EU or the EEA that may be necessary in individual cases takes place on the basis of data protection guarantees pursuant to Art.
45 et seq.
GDPR, in particular in the form of a data transfer agreement that contains the standard data protection clauses approved by the EU Commission.
The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our Website.
Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our Website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our Website, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Website for us.
Google Analytics places a cookie on the device of the data subject.
The definition of cookies is explained above.
With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our Website.
With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Website and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the technical of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google.
During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.
The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our Website by the data subject.
With each visit to our Website, such personal data will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America and stored there.
Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.
The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our Website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the data subject’s device.
In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.
In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such.
For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link  and install it.
This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics.
The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google.
If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics.
If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.
