What is a cookie.
A cookie is a small text file which the website you visit saves on your computer (or corresponding device with internet connection such as a tablet or smart phone).
Cookies are used to make a website function more effectively, but also to provide our website with certain types of information.
Cookies enable a website to distinguish between visitors, which makes it possible to offer each user a more positive website visit.
Cookies allow the website to remember the choices you have made, such as forms you have completed and your language settings so that you don't need to reset the same information every time you visit the site.
