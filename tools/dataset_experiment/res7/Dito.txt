What are your rights in relation to your personal data.
The Data Privacy Act of 2012, or DPA for short, gives you rights in relation to your personal data.
It essentially gives you control on how your personal data is collected and used by companies.
Below is a list of your rights.
We want to make sure that you understand what these are, so we are describing each of these rights in a simple and transparent manner.
The right to be informed.
When we ask you to share your personal data with us, we give you details of what data we will be using, why we will be using it, and how long we will be keeping it, among other things.
The right to object.
This is your right to tell us to stop using your personal data.
Please note, however, the DPA still allows us to use your personal data despite the exercise of this right under certain conditions.
For example, we will still process your personal data despite your objection if we are legally required to do so or if it is necessary to fulfill our legal obligations to you.
The right to access.
This right allows you to ask whether we have personal data on you and, if we do, ask for a copy of that personal data.
The right to rectification.
This gives you the right to correct anything that you think is wrong with the personal data we have on file on you.
The right to erasure or blocking.
This gives you the right to ask us to delete your personal data.
However, there are only certain instances where you can exercise this, such as in a case where you think we are processing your personal data unlawfully.
The right to portability.
This right allows you to get a copy of the personal data we have on you in a structure, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
The right to damages.
This right allows you to be indemnified for any damages that you may have sustained due to any violation of the DPA.
The right to complain with the National Privacy Commission ("NPC").
In case you feel that any of your privacy rights have been violated, you have the right to file a complaint with the NPC.
However, we encourage you to come to us first so we can resolve your complaint.
While you do have the right to withdraw the consent you have given (which can be done by reaching out to our Data Protection Officer), please note that this withdrawal will not stop us from processing your personal data so long as there are other legal bases to do so.
In other words, if you withdraw your consent, we can only stop the processing activities that rely on your consent.
If, however, we cannot give you a legal basis to justify the continued processing of your personal data, we will either stop the processing and delete your personal data or anonymize it.
In any case, to exercise any of these rights, please get in touch with our Data Protection Officer through the contact details we have indicated below.
In certain instances, we may ask for supporting documents or proof before we can move forward with your request.
In some cases, we may deny your request and, if allowed by law, we will notify you of the reason for denial.
We may also charge you a reasonable fee to help us process your request.
