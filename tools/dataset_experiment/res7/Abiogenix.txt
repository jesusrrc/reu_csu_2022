GENERAL OVERVIEW.

The information we collect is used to improve the user experience of the my-pills devices and service.
​.
Your information will NEVER be used for advertising, sold to, or shared with any third parties without your explicit approval.

This privacy policy describes our practices regarding the personal information we collect from users of our website located at my-pills.
com (the "Site") and our software application entitled "my-pills" (the "App") that, together with the uCap, uSev, and uBox (the "Devices") track your medication adherence (collectively, the functionality provided by the App, the "Service", also referred to as "my-pills" herewith).

WHAT INFORMATION DOES MY-PILLS COLLECT.
​.
THE SITE.
When you visit the Site, no personal information is collected unless you provide it to us voluntarily, for example by filling out the inquiry form with your Email Address.
If you use the Site to create an Account, then we will collect all information voluntarily supplied, including First and Last Names, Gender, Date of Birth, Phone Number, Mobile Service Provider, Email Address, Zip Code & Password.
If you use the Site to make a Purchase, then we will collect the purchaser's First and Last Names, Billing Address, Email Address, and Delivery Address.
We use Stripe.
com as our payment processor, so we never see your credit card information.
During browsing of the Site, we collect aggregate data using services such as Google Analytics and Mouseflow to track page views, interaction behavior, clicks, and devices used.
THE APP/SERVICE.
We utilize the user's Phone to store the Schedule locally as a series of timestamps, as well as Phone Logs that we use to monitor app behavior, such as crashes.
These Phone Logs may contain past location data, which we use for debugging and testing purposes ONLY.
When the App is started, the user is required to log in with their Email Address and Password to do anything except snooze an alarm.
Communication between the Phone and our Server is managed via https protocol with tokens and AES256 encryption, the same system used by online banking Apps.
User information, such as medication names, adherence history and scores, Care Circle member information, and profile information is pulled from our secure Server in real time and populated in the App.
​.
THE DEVICE.
No identifiable information is stored directly on the Device.
We only store timestamps, such as when medication is due or when it was taken.
Communicating with the Device (such as to change the schedule or other behavior) requires a unique 12-digit Pin Code during pairing as well as verification that the App is logged in with the correct credentials to talk to that particular Device.
Our Server authenticates the conversation each time it is initiated.
This prevents multiple users in one household from talking to each other's Devices, for instance.

You may change these rules and permissions at any time.
