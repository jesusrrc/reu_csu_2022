GDPR is new European Union legislation that comes into force on 25th May 2018 to regulate the use and storage of personal data by private and public sector organisations within member states of the European Union. For the most part it does not differ from existing data protection law in the UK. The prime purpose of the legislation is to regulate businesses selling to consumers and not the business to business activity carried out by 4NG Limited. However, like most EU legislation, GDPR has been deliberately drafted in such way to allow individual EU states to implement it according to local conditions. This means that its rulings are often ambiguous and open to different interpretations. The executive directors at 4NG have reviewed our data protection policies in line with GDPR and taken the following actions.
4NG Limited is committed to protecting all its customers, suppliers and team members by maintaining best practice data protection processes in line with all UK and EU law including GDPR.4NG is engaged in selling goods and services to corporate and public sector enterprises and all marketing activity is directed at these enterprises.
