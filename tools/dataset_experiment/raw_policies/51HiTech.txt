<div class="news_about">Professor Gao Yanli: Digital Twin Opens the Door of a Wonderful Era</div>
<span class="index-content">Editor’s note：With the rollout of state policies as well as the setup of national new areas such as Xiong’an, the digital twin has penetrated into all aspects of the smart city from the traditional manufacturing industry, greatly enriching people’s imagination of the future urban form.Meanwhile, we should fully understand the complexity of digital twin technology. Enterprises that underestimate the difficulties of implementing digital twin, being reluctant to invest in R&amp;D and unwilling to seek industrial collaboration, are unlikely to succeed or go too far in the market.In this article, we are honored to invite Professor Gao Yanli, chief expert of a smart city at the CAICT, a scientific research institution directly under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), to catch a glimpse of this splendid digital twin world and envision the future direction of digital twin technology.Gao Yanli, chief expert of a smart city at the CAICTDigital twins can be regarded as the quintessence of the digital age. The straightforward and prevalent concept that combines the virtual and the real opens the door of intelligence, providing people with new insights into understanding and changing the world even without venturing out.Digital twin cities successfully address the two issues of smart city architecture integration and governance collaboration, pushing the construction of smart cities to new heights. However, we should be sober that digital twin technology is complex and the industry should not blindly follow the trend. We ought to be persistent in creating the hard-core products of digital twins, to be worthy of this exquisite, mysterious and wonderful digital twin era.01 The digital twin revolutionizes the worldThe digital twin is prevailing in various industries. It has been a buzzword in the last two or three years at home and abroad, with a stunning number of studies and researches. The concept has been identified by many institutions as one of the top strategic technology trends that affect the world.National ministries such as the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Ministry of Science and Technology, rolled out policies and supporting programs to promote the basic research and applications of digital twins in the industrial and urban fields. Local governments are scrambling to build the first digital twin city while the industry is racing to come up with the latest digital twin solutions in order to take the lead in this cutting-edge technology.The digital twin has permeated the society in fields of the government, industries, factories, and cities. It has become the law of digital development about which everyone is talking about. That’s why the industries, capitals, and policies are rushing into this technology.Digital twins are indeed popular now.Conceptually, the digital twin reaches a wide range of audiences in only a couple of years as the buzzword is vivid and straightforward. Technologically, the ever-changing information technologies have made most people deeply convinced in the vision of digital twins. From single-point applications to integrated innovations, the digital twin is the milestone in China’s information-oriented development, and it may be the starting point of humans striding into the intelligent era. Exciting roads await.In terms of values, as China is reforming its administrative system, constructing a city of digital twin will reshape the urban digital genes and modernize the governance system. The digital twin redefines intelligent industrial parks, creating a new model of multi-dimensional performance management while the digital twin factories provide the best solutions for digitalizing the whole procedure of manufacturing including design, production, and assembling. As for the digital twin of the human body, it is opening up a new world of medical services with its unique perspective.Digital twin transforms the world. As the ancient Chinese Sage Lao Tse once stated that all things under heaven sprung from the existed and the existed sprung from the non-existed, the digital twin exemplifies the relationship of the existed and the non-existed in virtualizing the real world.The ubiquitous perception and integration, the interaction between the virtual and the real, they support and complement each other. The digital twin enables accurate mapping and perceptive insights even without venturing outside. In controlling the moving with the static and manipulating the real with the virtual, digital twin maps out influential strategies based on the intangible.Digital twin changes the industry rules, optimizes the development path and remodels operation, providing new ideas, perspectives and methods for various industries. It greatly shortens the development path of the industry and triggers profound technological changes in the industry’s systems, mechanisms, structures and rules. In digitalizing everything from macro to micro, a digital twin is pivotal in revolutionizing the world.02 Digital twin reshapes the governance systemThough significant progress has been made in the system cloud and data sharing, smart city construction still hits two bottlenecks, one in technology integration and the other in governance collaboration. Most intelligent city construction is still in its infancy of industrial information building, for want of technical and business architectures for the integrated urban governance. Hardware and software infrastructure, data, algorithms, technical capabilities, toolsets, and block applications are difficult to be incorporated into one architecture, to form a scalable functional system for further iteration. A vacuum exists in discrete, ineffective and inefficient managing systems. It is a daunting task to synchronize the management of different regions, lines and blocks.Digital twin reconstructs the overall architecture of smart cities. In terms of technologies, the digital twin city model platform incorporates the underlying infrastructure, static and dynamic data, core system and technical capability, applications and supporting system, achieving collaborative governance and the integration of the real and the virtual. The underlying infrastructure, consisting of traditional information infrastructure and the new infrastructure, reshapes the urban digital genes and creates an intelligent operating environment with its powerful abilities to perceive, transmit, compute and control.Therefore, the advent of digital twin cities provides an opportunity for and chart the course of reconstructing the overall architecture of a smart city and specifies the levels and paths of integration. By establishing a collaborative platform of the urban brain, the digital twin city connects the systems of urban management, ecological governance, traffic control, market supervision, emergency response, public security, etc.Driven by major events and special scenarios, based on the digital twin city model platform and equipped with its integrated data, algorithms and tools, the digital twin city is able to formulate a closed-loop procedure of proactive awareness, preemptive governance, and optimized plan, realizing coordinated management of urban governance.Digital twin virtualizes public services. Typical features such as global vision, accurate mapping, simulation, virtual-real interaction and intelligent intervention of digital twin cities are accelerating the innovation of urban governance and services, bringing about a number of super applications with a global perspective.As the representative scenarios of digital twin cities lie mostly in urban governance, such as planning, constructing, ecosystem, market and traffic, the unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19 expedites the digitalization of the whole society and speeds up the implementation of virtualized public services. Digitalized contactless post-Internet life experiences such as online education, medical treatment and cultural performances greatly enrich the life of the public and give the citizens more choices. In the future, the urban form will lean towards digital aggregation and physical separation.The digital twin is devoted to improving modern governance. The COVID-19 pandemic exposes serious deficiencies in the global governance system such as the incapable emergency response mechanism, inadequate disease control plans, inaccurate information release, lagging public opinion guidance, inadequate resource allocation and insufficient decision-making ability. Although smart cities have played a significant role in containing the epidemic, the problems of unscheduled resources, unanalyzed data, unorganized manpower and inefficient network persist. Cooperative citizens and responsible local governments have become the backbone of China’s fighting against the epidemic.As Lao Tse pointed out that action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance and order should be secured before disorder has begun, the all-element expression, visualization of multidimensional data and scenes, spatial computing, overlaying analysis, simulation and remote control of the digital twin city as well as the derived abilities to identify urban risks, observing city operation, tracking trajectory, controlling events, deducing, simulating emergency plans and allocating resources, echo with the demands of modern governance in innovation, coordination, prevention, supervision and organization, making it a major booster for improving the governance system.The wave of new infrastructure is accelerating the development of digital twin cities. Previously, the precise mapping and virtual-real interaction of a digital twin city were largely dependent on the IoT, and as China’s new infrastructure unfolds, it has expanded to assimilate all the components of the new infrastructure, including 5G, IoT, edge computing, data centers, as well as the intelligent transformation of municipal facilities, industrial equipment and public services.By means of intensive spatial layout, the city will form a new overall structure of ubiquitous identifying, perceiving, connecting and computing, to intelligently define everything. It will unleash the operations and services of the infrastructure for the public, enabling the digital transformation of all walks of life.The massive construction of the new infrastructure will greatly lower the cost of building a digital twin city and strongly support the simultaneous operation of the virtual and the real, thus speeding up the construction of the digital twin city.03 The journey of digital twins: a long way to goTo implement a digital twin is more complex than imagined. Enormous basic theories need to be deeply studied, the huge number of technical solutions need to be explored, massive application scenarios need to be verified and colossal mechanisms need to break through before a digital twin really accomplishes precise mapping, twin parallel and the virtual serving the real, be it a factory, a city or a human body.The digital twin is a tremendous project of intellectual integration of knowledge, technologies, data, algorithms, tools and applications, thereby needing a powerful supporting industrial ecology.For creating a digital twin city, depicting the appearance is one thing, while accurately expressing the city’s content, personality, characteristics and rules with technical means such as models, data, algorithms and tools, is another. In the underlying new infrastructure, the lack of reasonable plans and specifications for the intensive layout of urban space, the invisible social relationships between urban elements and the uncertainty of operating rules are all insurmountable obstacles for digital twin cities.Some domestic enterprises are more inclined to earn fast money. They churn out low-quality products, invest little on R&amp;D and are reluctant to go deep into technological innovation. Some ride the tide of digital twins after the concept has been popularized.Instead of actively exploring the technology, they labeled the existing products as digital twins and introduced them into the market, seriously disrupting the industry and confusing public understanding. Given the complexity of digital twins, enterprises that underestimate the difficulties of implementing digital twin, being reluctant to invest in R&amp;D and unwilling to seek industrial collaboration, are unlikely to succeed or go too far in the market.Currently, it is pressing to construct the digital twin cities while the technical solutions are far from mature. Although some encouraging progress has been made in visualizing city modeling, there is still a long way to go. Therefore, in order to promote the implementation of digital twin cities, on the one hand, the government should actively unleash the data and related resources to pave the way for piloting digital twin cities. On the other hand, the mechanisms should be integrated to establish adaptive organizational and business structures.The industry should actively build a complementarily cooperative ecology, to consistently verify the implementation of the solutions. Scientific research institutions should lead their way in innovation and strengthen relevant visionary basic research, removing the obstacles for governments and industries in implementing the digital twin cities.Never forget why you started, and you can accomplish your mission. Like every revolutionary technology, digital twin cities were questioned at the very beginning. People worried that in the gigantic network of a digital twin city, the city’s activities would all be under surveillance. It will be like a digital prison in which the citizens lose privacy and their actions are monitored. The concern is not without reason. For brutal managers, a digital twin city might be a disaster for the people but for the righteous ones, a digital twin city will increase the well-being of the people.Powerful technical means make the city smarter, more harmonious and efficient and the service more diverse, convenient, proactive and personalized. The management of the intelligent city is shifting from governance to services. In constructing a digital twin city, only by elevating the well-being of the people can it go far and steadily in the future.Digital twins open the door of understanding and changing the world, pushing digitalization and intelligent transformation to an admirable height. It might be substituted by more advanced technology later, but fortunately, the new wonderful era has just begun. Let us embrace it and create a bright future together!</span>

<div class="news_about">51WORLD Launches Digital Twin Water Industry Line</div>
<span class="index-content">More than 70 % of the surface of this blue planet we live on is covered by water. For 51WORLD, to make a digital twin of the water is an important step towards cloning the earth.Generally, China’s water resources are insufficient and they vary greatly in different regions and seasons. Therefore, it is imperative for us to ensure the safety of people’s lives and property in the event of floods, to utilize water resources efficiently, and to protect the water environment effectively.To simulate water bodies is extremely difficult as it often involves processing massive data and entails a complex governance system that affects each other. The technical bottleneck of incorporating watersheds, rivers, lakes, and reservoir pipelines into one scene and the lack of digital twin models further compound the simulation.▲Digital twin simulation of the rise and fall of the water levelsSince last year, with the support of all-element scenarios and cooperated with leading partners in water services, 51WORLD has gone deep into the information technology, bringing new ideas and new technologies to the industry.51WORLD believes that the natural waters and urban pipeline networks will be manageable in the same scene, multi-source data will be visualized and replicated in digital twin scenarios, which helps the personnel respond quickly and makes the public better understand the water industry.Therefore, 51WORLD has launched the digital twin industry line of major application scenarios such as urban water supply, flood defense, drought relief, and ecological governance, which has been landed in a number of provinces and cities at home and abroad.01 Water Resources Protection and Ecological ManagementClear waters and green mountains are as good as mountains of gold and silver. As water protection has become a manifesto of the Chinese government, 51WORLD makes a digital twin of the watersheds, rivers and water bodies in the natural ecology, and provides targeted solutions for ecological management, pollution sources control, indicators monitoring and flood defense.Among them, the “Three Smart Lakes” of Yunnan Province, 51WORLD’s major industry project in the field of water environmental protection, enables the administrators to deduce the water quality to observe the distribution of pollutants in the lake over a period of time and displays the tributaries impacting the lake’s mid-point water quality to trace the pollutants.▲Scene replication of 3000 square kilometersThree Smart Lakes is a key project under the direction of the Fuxian Lake Administration of Yuxi City and guided by Yunnan Provincial Committee. It is an implementation of the action plan of strengthening ecological environment protection by the Yunnan Province and a concrete measure of protecting the nine lakes on the plateau.In a few weeks, together with local water management enterprises and environmental protection research institute, 51WORLD quickly replicated a total of nearly 3,000 square kilometers of digital twin scenes of Fuxian Lake, Xingyun Lake, Qilu Lake, and surrounding watersheds, and built a set of ecological supervision system, facilitating systematic perception, scientific decision-making, resourceful management, and effective operation. In the project, 51WORLD constructed a system to monitor and perceive the water, environment, meteorology, and soil conditions, which were presented in digital twin scenes.▲The rise of the lake modelThe system loaded the water quality data collected by the sensors deployed in the lake and visualized them with different shades of colors according to the degree of water pollution. At the same time, the system demonstrated the changes in water quality in a given period with the analyzed results over time displaying on both sides of the panels.By replicating the water quality and the impact of the surrounding rivers on the lake, the managers were capable of visually observing the water quality of the lake and quickly making corresponding measures.▲Water pollution deductionWater volume is one of the key indicators of monitoring the water. The digital twin “Three Smart Lakes” could detect and track the flows and volumes of the lake and its tributaries, displaying the whole process and elements of water resources utilization. In addition to replicating the present, the system was able to predict to some extent.Equipped with the water model algorithm and combined with the visual scenes, 51WORLD could predict the changes of water volumes, the evolution of water pollution and environment protection tendencies, enabling the managers to watch the predicted results in person.Ecological law enforcement is another daily task of the water management department. By accessing the cameras, the intelligent law enforcement module of the system connected the virtual scenes with the real scenes in order to monitor the later in real-time.As for the UAVs and unmanned ships, the system mapped out real-time patrol routes in the digital twin scenes of the lakes and realistically represented the law enforcement process from a third perspective, thus helping reasonable allocation of the task forces and ensuring water safety and ecological stability.Intelligent law enforcement simulation Similar to the “Three Smart Lakes”, other intelligent water projects can realize the rapid embedding and two-way interaction of all-element 3D scenes on the webpage by accessing the third-party Web of 51WORLD SuperAPI, to flexibly get the eco-environmental protection data of the administration bureau for the system’s subsequent development and data update.02 Urban water supply, drainage, and flood defenseWater supply and drainage systems are indispensable for urban planning. Relying on its cutting-edge digital twin capability, 51WORLD replicates urban water supply and drainage networks, sewage treatment plants, and the distribution of rivers and lakes in the 3D scenes of urban construction, providing the basis for making relevant decisions.On the digital twin backplane, 51WORLD represents the water supply areas, sources of the water, pumping stations, distribution points, pipeline network directions, and water plant locations, providing assistance for decision-makers in planning the water supply system.▲A planning map of the water supply systemApart from replicating the scenes, the digital twin can display the locations of water plants in 3D scenes in the form of POI, and get access to crucial water quality indicators such as the color, turbidity, residual chlorine, chemical oxygen demand, total bacteria, total coliforms, heat-resistant coliforms, etc., to ensure the security of urban water supply.At the same time, real-time video information such as UAVs patrolling and fixed-point cameras in key areas of water sources can also be connected to the digital twin system, to identify emergencies such as intrusion and water pollution. As flood defense is closely related to the lives and properties of the people, it charts the course of digital twin water applications. At present, 51WORLD is able to provide emergency demonstrations, real-time surveillance in flood-prone areas, and evacuation in disaster-stricken regions.▲Flood inundation analysisThese features have been well received by customers overseas. In the Singapore Smart City Management System, a digital twin built for Singapore’s top developer Surbana Jurong and the Singaporean Government, 51WORLD replicated the scenes of the whole nation, in which it deduced different scopes of the inundated urban areas according to different scales of floods and visualized them in 3D, providing assistance for decision-makers in fighting against the floods.03 The advent of the digital twin water industry2020 marks the last year of the “13th Five-Year Plan” for promoting water conservancy towards informatization in China. According to the plan, China aims to build a water conservancy system featuring intelligent water applications, open information, intensive infrastructure, safe network, and optimized security across China by the end of this year. China’s water conservancy informationization has been full-fledged since then. As the plan unfolds, the digital twin applications of water conservancy also usher in their achievements.In terms of technologies, The Internet of Things, big data and cloud computing are gradually being assimilated into the water conservancy industry, promoting the construction of China’s command system of flood and drought defense, and the establishment of the backbone networks across China while the intelligent models have been operated in major projects such as flood forecasting and cross-region water diversion.In addition, geographic information, water networks and water conservancy projects are incorporated into one scene since numerous water monitoring terminals have collected massive relevant data. In short, the improvement of the IoT devices and water information networks has laid the foundation for applying digital twin in the water industry.▲Swan Lake smart water solutionsAs for governmental funds, the state is encouraging more investment into water informationization. In 2017, the total amount of China’s investment in water conservancy information technologies reached about 21.29 billion yuan while in 2018, the number came up to 24.05 billion yuan. Research institute predicted that it would grow at a CAGR of around 12% from 2018 to 2023.On the other hand, investment in water ecological management went up year by year. The State Council issued an Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution in 2015, in which it expected that about 4 to 5 trillion yuan were needed by 2020 to achieve corresponding targets, of which the local governments were required to contribute about 1.5 trillion yuan. In terms of demands, more than 1.2 million river chiefs and rangers have been installed across China as a strategic measure to reform the ecological system and build a beautiful China.It is a market of huge potentials and it is promising to carry out water management efficiency in the digital twin scenarios. In addition, the public becomes increasingly concerned about water quality, urban drainage, the treatment of polluted waters and ecological protection. It is also necessary for water administrators to respond to public concerns in a digital way. All these have contributed to pushing 51WORLD to further promote the digital twin industry line of the water businesses.Relying on its original digital twin technology, 51WORLD will continue to forge in-depth cooperation with industry partners and put forward more effective and down-to-earth water solutions, to build a smart bridge between “clear waters and green mountains” and “mountains of gold and silver”.</span>

<div class="news_about">Another National Benchmark Landed! 51WORLD Helps Nanjing Jiangbei New Area to Build the First Digital Twin City</div>
<span class="index-content">June 7 marked the official completion of the smart city command center of the CBD in Jiangbei New Area.▲The handover ceremonyThe system, co-developed by 51WORLD and Nanjing Unicom, portrayed the landscape, presented the trend, and deduced the future of the area with the most advanced digital twin technology in China. Equipped with various sensors and incorporated with the 5G network, NB-IoT, BIM, and AI, the digital twin CBD was able to achieve global awareness, data sharing, cross command, and accurate feedback.▲The digital twin CBD in Jiangbei New AreaAt the handover ceremony, Wang Dongning, the CBD office director, said that the construction of the CBD smart city manifested the CBD had always attached great importance to high techs, and he emphasized that in the future, information integration technology should be assimilated into the technical means, working methods and achievements presentation.Wang Dongning further pointed out that the smart city command center was a bold venture into the combination of information technology, computer system, decision-making system, and visual image processing technology.01 The first digital twin cityAs one of the 19 state-level new areas approved by the State Council and the only one in Jiangsu Province, Nanjing Jiangbei New Area strategically positions itself as the pilot area of innovation, the demonstration area for new-type urbanization, the hub for modern industries in the Yangtze River Delta region and the major platform for opening-up and cooperation in Yangtze River Economic Belt.According to a 2019 district guideline on smart city construction, Nanjing Jiangbei New Area aspired to construct itself as the first digital twin city in China by 2025, promoting the virtualization of city elements, real-time urban operation and coordinated smart governance with digital twin technology.Against this backdrop, a smart city command center with the major functions of smart construction, intelligent governance and enterprise service came into being. Utilizing 51UrbanData digital backplane construction technology, 51WORLD restored the large scenes of the 25.4 square kilometers of the CBD and meticulously presented core areas such as the Health Center and Qinglong Green Belt and major transportation hubs such as the Dingshan overpass and Jiangbei Avenue Expressway. Overlaid with the dynamic traffic flow, the digital twin CBD represented a lively picture of its real-world counterpart.▲Jiangbei Avenue Expressway02 Smart construction: the present and the future of urban constructionAs Nanjing aims to build another city center around the CBD, a large number of high-standard projects have sprung up in recent years. In order to better manage urban construction, the smart city system accurately presented the qualities and progress of the projects in real-time.A global view of the large scenes of the 25.4 square kilometers in the CBD was generated in the digital twin scenario. As for a specific area, viewers could see corresponding information such as functional area planning, land planning, municipal infrastructure construction, and project progress, with urban planning legends indicating different natures of land utilization.▲International Health Center planningThe system displayed the details of the key projects with data panels, including construction and management information, progress warning, equipment access on the site, etc.In terms of progress management, it adopted the BIM model to visually show the progress of the project and distinguish between the undone and the completed, presenting an unobstructed picture of progress status and providing a comparison of the planned and actual progress.▲BIM model for projects under construction5G-supported UAVs, a feature of the smart city construction, could patrol specific lines and respond to emergencies. As the eye of the sky in the CBD, the drones were able to observe the traffic conditions on the ground, take photos and videos of emergencies, monitor the construction at any time, distinguish the cover situation of the naked soil, and identify illegal construction.03 Smart governance: down-to-earth functions after numerous tryoutsSmart governance consisted of city management, urban security, and environmental protection. Equipped with terminal IoT sensors or other data devices, the system generated relevant warnings after background judgment, which were incorporated into the digital twin backplane for presentation.▲Parking managementIn terms of urban management, the system had designed down-to-earth functions such as city environment supervision, dirt trucks regulation and parking control. Similar consideration was also given to modules of urban security and environmental protection.▲Dust controlTaking dust control as an example, the viewer could check the index in real-time and the system would issue an alarm if anything unusual happened. Then the managers were notified to deal with the event, achieving the closed-loop of processing.“Each function is then modified demand of the team and the CBD office after repeated investigation, research, and communication. In this process, the CBD office gets more and more expectant of the smart city system while the system itself becomes increasingly perfect and down to earth,” commented Zheng Yingya of the 51WORLD Digital City Division.04 Digital twins continue to boost Jiangbei New Area constructionNanjing Jiangbei New Area has previously proposed to deliver the best service and build the most intelligent city by 2021. Wang Dongning, the CBD office director, pointed out that there were three hurdles to overcome for the future development of the smart city system.First, how to make the system play a greater role on the basis of existing functions, to better fit the regional development of the CBD in scope as well as in-depth;Second, how to wisely combine technology with management, organization, and processing procedures;Third, how to engage more people, institutions, and enterprises into building the intelligent city system.▲Restoration of regional landmark buildingsIn the future, 51WORLD will maintain close cooperation with Nanjing Unicom to continuously provide top-notch digital twin service for the smart city system of the CBD in Jiangbei New Area, and, with its original technology, make a contribution to modernizing and transforming Jiangbei New Area.</span>

<div class="news_about">51WORLD’s Cloud Mirror System Helps Implement the Digital Twin Airport</div>
<span class="index-content">At night, the grand and brightly-lit digital twin airport is hustling and bustling with planes and ground vehicles. On each route, the wing status of the aircraft, whether the landing gear is opened, the plane’s speed, altitude, latitude, and longitude are synchronized in real-time, presenting a lively picture of the whole airspace.▲Cloud mirror system interface demoSounds like an aviation simulation game? It is materialized in the cloud mirror system developed by 51WORLD and China Academy of Civil Aviation Science and Technology. Unlike the game, the digital twin airport has access to the real-time data of aviation, terminals, and ground operations, achieving “what you see is what you get”, which helps to improve operational efficiency and reduce management costs to a great extent.Covid-19 boosts intelligent airport constructionThe sudden outbreak of the new coronavirus has made the global civil aviation industry suffer from a cold winter that has not been seen in decades.The Airports Council International said in a report that the pandemic would reduce global passengers by two-fifths in 2020, while the airport’s revenue would be slashed by approximately 50 percent and the total loss would exceed $76 billion. Global carriers are also expected to undergo a 44 percent year-on-year decline in passenger revenue this year.Therefore, it is imperative to use digital twin, big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and other technological means to elevate the efficiency of the operation and management of the shipping hub. Meanwhile, as a crucial component of traditional infrastructure, the airport plays a significant role in safeguarding the livelihood of the community and guaranteeing economic development.▲Aircraft take-off and land in real-timeIn January, the Civil Aviation Administration issued an action plan for China’s airport construction, in which it put forward to build safe, green, intelligent, and humane airports by 2035 by means of intelligent measures. 2020 marks the beginning of the construction and the Civil Aviation Administration has established 23 demonstration projects of smart airport construction in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Despite strong support from the civil aviation authorities, technically, it is not easy to upgrade the traditional airports to the digital twin level.First of all, it is extremely difficult to integrate diverse systems since an air transport hub needs a variety of complex systems such as scene surveillance radar, airport panoramic monitoring, airport collaborative decision-making (A-CDM), delay information release, air traffic control coordination, meteorological observation and intelligent building management system (IBMS), to get the goings of an aircraft, the airspace, the situation on the ground as well as passengers flow of the public transport.Secondly, the lack of linkage between multiple departments such as the airport operations center (AOC), the terminal operations center (TOC), the ground transportation center (GTC), local municipal departments (rail transportation, health and epidemic prevention departments) and public security system, often result in data isolations.Finally, the chronic issues of inadequate data space attributes, fragmented scenes, and unintuitive interactive interfaces existing in the traditional airport management system itself are also the hurdles to overcome in the new airport construction.To build digital twin airports with a unified scale, caliber and interfaceTo cope with these problems mentioned above, 51WORLD and the China Academy of Civil Aviation Science and Technology jointly created a digital twin airport system- the cloud mirror system. At present, the system has been landed at some airport in the north. Compared with the traditional flat data center, the “cloud mirror” can map and feedback the aircraft’s take-offs and landings, cruise status as well as apron safety monitoring in space coordinates, attribute real geographic space coordinates to vehicles and aircraft, open up data isolations, and improve the effect and efficiency of information management.The standards boiled down to “three unifications”-namely, unified scale, unified caliber, and unified interface.The unified scale attributed a uniform, an identical coordinate system to the airport’s objects, data and information flow to clarify the location and status of objects such as aircraft, ground vehicles, IoT terminals, passengers, and staff.After integrating the spatial data of BIM, 3DMAX, CAD and GIS, 51WORLD and the team of China Academy of Civil Aviation Science and Technology mapped and connected the real geographic information coordinate system, quickly generate the airspace and city floor of hundreds of square kilometers of L2-L3, terminal buildings and apron road lines of L3 with 51Urbandata, thus constructing a digital twin base and laying a foundation for further comprehensive management.The unified caliber enabled the system to access multi-format, multi-form and multi-connotation data such as the surveillance radar, apron panoramic monitoring system, airport collaborative decision-making system (A-CDM), delay information release system, air traffic control coordination system, meteorological observation system, intelligent building management system (IBMS), IOT system, video surveillance, perimeter security system, etc., to achieve joint control of airport management.Both teams preset management objects such as aircraft and ground vehicles that could be driven by real-world operating data with independent semantics, which could be managed individually or jointly to form the object of a dynamic digital twin.For example, the operators could learn, in real-time, the current or past working status of the digital twins of ground-based operating vehicles such as bird-repellent vehicles, ferries, tractors, snow-sweepers, weeding vehicles, etc. with the data of their positions, speeds, and turning angles. In the event of an incident, the operator could check it back immediately.▲Ground vehicles managementThe unified interface empowered the system to manage the airport with one single screen by means of information integration, SOA, and SSO. At the same time, it was capable of allocating corresponding operating and data permissions for different personnel, posts and users according to the regulations, to ensure that the rules were strictly implemented and the personnel coordinated freely. When the scenes of the aprons and terminals ere highly accurate, services such as pedestrian thermals, vehicle dynamics, V2X simulation, driverless training, and traffic flow simulation could be introduced to preview the emergency management and airport construction scheme in the digital twin airport interface, providing the managers with an intuitive decision-making basis. It was worth noting that, via 51WORLD cloud rendering technology, workers could get the same operating experience and visual effects in the mobile applications as in the mainframe, and reversely control airport equipment to ensure high utilization of the system.Digital Twin Airports: addressing the issues of the present and being future-orientedThe digital twin airport greatly enhanced the efficiency of data analysis and business management, and provided intuitive and visual solutions to various kinds of problems in airport management, enabling airport managers to enjoy the technical dividends of digital twins. In terms of aviation, the system focused on the management of airspace radar, flight schedules, real-time flight monitoring and reviewing, runway take-off and landing occupation, airspace safety, UFO intrusion, weather, visibility, and control information.Aircraft posturesIn measuring how busy a route was, the system could generate a thermodynamic chart of each route by analyzing the time occupancy ratios, and present the monitoring results via the voxel grid after superimposing all the charts of the routes. In traditional large-screen mode, the results were often carried on multiple interfaces and presented in three views respectively, which could be converted into readable information only after the interpretation and recognition of a professional.On the contrary, in the cloud mirror system, an operator could easily arrange the flights and the routes within one interface. In terms of ground operations, as 51WORLD incorporated the surveillance video into the digital twin, combining the various sensors deployed in the airport perimeter, the system was able to issue warnings on unusual behaviors such as intrusion, unauthorized operation, speeding, and overtime working, thus safeguarding the operations on the ground.The interface of ground vehicles managementAs the accuracy of the digital twin airport improves in the future, the system can also calculate the blind areas and visual fields of monitoring, analyze the distribution of security, and help the managers to draw up proactive security strategy. In terms of the terminals, functions such as public transportation, building management, and visitor services could be loaded to connect with digital twin park solutions. At the same time, in line with national new infrastructure construction and to build a safe, green, intelligent and humane airport, the cloud mirror system also added in V2X communication, laser/mm-wave/ vision, vehicle dynamics, unmanned training set, advanced process simulation (APS) connecting capabilities. In the near future, the digital twins of unmanned shuttle buses and unmanned logistics vehicles can be realized on the same platform, which is convenient for the airport to expand related services.ConclusionAs the transportation hub of a city, an airport is a gateway and window for the city to demonstrate its achievements in smart construction, and a safe, green, intelligent, and humane airport speaks volumes for the city.The intelligent infrastructure and the traditional infrastructure are both indispensable for constructing a safe, green, intelligent, and humane airport while the digital twin technology is the bridge between the two, according to Zhang Kunqi, the manager of 51WORLD Pre-Sales Program and Ecological Partnership Department participating in the project.The business capabilities and technical strengths of the China Academy of Civil Aviation Science and Technology and 51WORLD were highly valued by each other. The success of this project couldn’t be separated from the professional advice and decades’ accumulation of the Academy in civil aviation safety, operation and development while 51WORLD delivered leading digital twin products and services.In the future, 51WORLD and the Academy will continue to work together in constructing safe, green, intelligent, and humane airports to help the long-term and healthy development of China’s civil aviation industry.</span>

<div class="news_about">How to Update Smart City Operating Platform from GIS to Digital Twins, We First Need to Answer a Philosophical Question|51SHARE</div>
<span class="index-content">The editor’s note:He studied in China’s best GIS major and turned down a postgraduate recommendation from his university. He rode 6,000 kilometers to see the great landscape of China. He maintained that the dimensions of the application of geographic information data should be elevated and a unified structured semantics is a key to earth cloning. He is Yang Jianshun, a system architect of the all-element scenarios team at the 51WORLD Earth Cloning Institute. Today we invite him to talk about GIS, digital twins, and Earth cloning.The essence of the world can be regarded as a monophysical entity organized by a unified all-element semantics.Part.1 Stepping out of the geographic information systemWhat is the essence of the world?This philosophical question is a probing and pragmatic question for 51WORLD’s system architects.When I applied for the GIS major at Wuhan University, my idea was simple — I liked geography and wanted to travel all over China like Xu Xiake, a renowned geographer in the 1600s. It was also at Wuhan University that I came up with the idea of digitally depicting the earth we are living in.Yang Jianshun51WORLD coins the idea as Earth Cloning, in which geographic information data is still one of the underlying foundations, only with the dimension of the applications being raised.After graduation, I was recommended to Beijing Normal University for a postgraduate degree. But as time went on, I found myself not interested in academics. Therefore, I dropped out of school and was eager to put what I have conceived into practice.Since then, I have accumulated ten years of 3D GIS-related working experience in technology, products, and markets.Looking back, the development of China’s geographic information industry is relatively smooth in general. Over the past five years, 3D GIS players and platforms, as well as the corresponding government and market needs, are emerging in this fledgling industry.Inevitably, technical inertia and stereotypes appeared. Traditional geographic information industry attached great importance to data, but without adequate data value mining; data analysis was paid enough attention but short of an effective expression of the results.There was a gulf existing between the status quo and the ever-changing needs of Party A. In traditional 3D GIS R&amp;D, the engineers chose to self-develop a set of engine platforms, on which the geographic information was presented. Some of these engines were revamped on the basis of open-source engines (such as WorldWind, OsgEarth, CesiumJS, etc.) while others were developed from scratch.As far as I know, there are hundreds of digital earth platforms developed in China alone. This was also what I’ve been doing for a long time: processing geographic information data efficiently under limited hardware and software conditions, and presenting it as best as possible.But in terms of the larger industry, everyone has made much the same thing, with no substantial let alone game-changing breakthroughs. There were no fundamental differences from the platforms of a decade ago other than the optimization of performance and efficiency.In recent years, Internet giants such as HBAT(Huawei, Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent), as well as digital twin startups such as 51WORLD, have tended to assimilate real-time GIS data from the Internet and the Internet of Things, which approach may not be that precise, but makes GIS data alive. The concept of upgrading basic data such as geographic information before applying is also gradually impacting the industry.After joining 51WORLD, I discussed with Wu Yaguang, the dean of the Earth Cloning Institute, for many a time. He is an expert in computer graphics and I have been working on 3D GIS for many years. Our cross-sector exchanges inspired each of us on data organization, graphics rendering, and interactive applications, especially on the technology path of how to clone the earth.Everyone makes different decisions at different times. Looking back, further study might be helpful for my future life, but I don’t regret giving it up since I enjoy and excel at what I am doing.Part.2 Exploring deeply in the Smart CityA smart city is a market with massive potentials. Traditional GIS enterprises have built up a plentiful understanding of the business and data in addressing the customers’ pain points. They still take the lead as the first movers in the industry after the 3D GIS was introduced. We should admit that we are standing on the shoulders of giants.51WORLD enters the market with its eyes on computer graphics and computer vision. It has delivered a large number of digital twin products of buildings and industrial parks and tried out in city-level applications. But in general, 51WORLD is still a new player and has a long way to go.51WORLD Earth Cloning 3 (EC3)For now, we are not yet able to process and analyze large-scale geographic information independently. However, as a technological startup, 51WORLD’s digital twin products have the advantage of short production cycles, fast iterations, consistent quality and great scalability. Archer Li, the company’s CEO and founder says 51WORLD has three “not to does “.First, instead of collecting data sources, we focus on data fusion.Second, instead of delivering general integration services, we sharpen our competitiveness in the core products of the all-element scenarios.Third, instead of venturing into vertical industry applications alone, we are glad to co-develop with our ecological partners. These guidelines determine 51WORLD’s business models and market strategies.As far as I know, some companies in the industry, especially many start-ups, go out of their ways to get a project and in the end, have to outsource the software and adopt project-based management.This labor-consuming approach is actually detrimental to the growth of a company. Issues such as lengthening project cycle and slow repayment resulted from demand changes and chaotic management, may bring down a company. However, in the domestic market, whether you can directly solve the problem for Party A is a matter of life and death.So someone has to do the basic work. In this process, we mesh with industry partners and general integrators to provide them with standardized digital twin services. The cake of the smart cities is huge and the enterprises need to know their boundaries.But as one of the R&amp;D personnel, I know, apart from sharpening our competitiveness, we should also strengthen our weak points, among which are the processing of multiple data sources and business-oriented data analysis.Part.3 Digital twins: real data applications of elevated dimensionAs the company expands, the direction of our R&amp;D gets more diversified and the Earth Cloning Institute feels the pressure. For example, the burgeoning demands for oblique photography, BIM, and CAD data processing at this stage are actually what the R&amp;D is calling for after receiving the feedback from the market.The more diversified the market needs, the more we need to focus. The technological team should have its own independent thinking in choosing the research direction, to lead the development of the industry, to explore the frontline standards, and to develop more innovative and game-changing products.This is the only way to clone the earth. But no matter which specific R &amp; D field we are aiming for, we are looking for a way to create digital twin earth, to clone the planet we are living. This colossal project starts with data collection, in which the data of different dimensions are exhaustively gathered in various ways, to replicate the real world.This is also what many industries including geographic information are doing, from vectors and rasters in traditional GIS to oblique photography and laser point clouds, as well as BIM in the construction industry and high-precision maps for autonomous driving in transportation, etc.But the method of creating business applications directly in this “replicated world” is not necessarily viable since the lack of a unified structured semantics will affect the final effect.So what is a unified structured semantics? We believe that the earth is made of elements. Whether it is a vector, raster, grid, or point cloud, it is a form of expression of the elements. All elements need a unified structured semantics to describe and interpret. For example, we can understand the buildings through the semantics of the contour, height, color, material, and building structure, etc.Without a structured semantics, all we see is triangle grids or point clouds connected together. All industries need to extract their “customized” data standards and specifications. Therefore, we regard the nature of the world as a monophysical entity organized by a unified all-element semantics.Future data format shall not only conform to the standards of the data producers or one individual industry but also take into account more knowledge including multi-industry data production, multi-engine platforms, and multi-industry applications. Therefore, these “definitions” need to meet a higher level of standards, thereby ensuring the independence of standards in various fields while achieving an inter-industry data connection.51WORLD Digital Twin ShanghaiIt is based on this concept that 51WORLD presents the region’s all-element scenarios(AES), including the scenes of cities, roads, buildings, and vegetation from the real world, featuring in virtual reality, geographic information reality, physical simulation reality, and real-time free interactivity. It is also with AES that we create a digital twin of the real world.In the future, we will phrase in some processing standards for AES semantics to promote the industry. 51WORLD stays committed to cloning the earth and the aspiration of creating a realistic, complete, and lasting digital twin world remains firm. And that’s what I’ve been dreaming of for years as a GIS student.</span>

<div class="news_about">The Roundup of How to Create a Massive Simulation Environment for Intelligent Transportation? |51TECH</div>
<span class="index-content">51TECH is 51WORLD’s brand-new column, delivering the frontline analysis of cutting-edge and hard-core technologies.We believe that technology transforms our life, we believe in the goodness of technology, and we hope to share our experience and thinking with the industry at 51TECHIn recent years, the concept of “big world” put forward in the field of smart transportation has posed new challenges for related simulation. Among them, the four major challenges for the static simulation of intelligent traffic are the construction of super-large maps of hundreds of square kilometers at the macro level, the integration of digital assets in the “big world” at the meso-level, the optimization of rendering efficiency on multiple platforms, and the construction of a composite digital asset library at the micro-level.In this issue of 51TECH, we invite Wang Chao, the content director of 51WORLD Intelligent Driving and Transportation Division, to talk about the upgrade of static environment simulation technologies and the detailed explanation of creating a large traffic simulation environment.The content team of 51WORLD Intelligent Driving and Transportation Division has been committed to providing full-stack content solutions for autonomous driving simulation and traffic simulation since its inception. It has accumulated rich experience in the rapid production of simulated maps, automated map generation, efficient rendering on multiple platforms, and aesthetic balance after delivering nearly 100 projects.As a seasoned frontline static simulation engineer, Wang feels the challenges facing the current industry.Part.1 Constructing and balancing the “big virtual world”As the advent of the 5G era has pushed intelligent transportation to a new height, the concept of “big world” came into being in the field of traffic simulation. The big world denotes the upsurge of demand in the range of simulated visual maps and the length of road network. A transportation project may require hundreds or even thousands of kilometers of large or super large simulation maps for training, collecting vehicle data set, and assisting in decision-making. It also means an exponential increase in the volume of simulation functions.Four major challenges come on the heels of this burgeoning industry: the construction of super-large maps of hundreds of square kilometers, the integration of digital assets in the “big world”, the optimization of rendering efficiency on multiple platforms, and the construction of a composite digital asset library.01 Construction of super-large road networksA bird’s eye view of the West Third Ring Project in BeijingSince the localized simulation maps of the first perspective are limited and inadequate for smart transportation, the free-view maps with the car-tracking perspective and the bird’s-eye view are constantly yearned for. However, it needs an accurate restoration of hundreds of kilometers or even thousands of kilometers of the simulated terrain to realize a bird’s-eye view from the third perspective. For example: to simulate a 100- square-kilometer scene, it is necessary to recreate roads with a total length of 300 kilometers, of which about 40 kilometers are highways or first-level roads, about 160 kilometers are urban expressways or second-level roads and 100 kilometers of branch roads or roads of the third level and below, thus forming a huge road network.A diagram of the simulated road networkTherefore, we need to efficiently integrate and utilize limited computing resources, so as to complete such large-scale simulation maps. Next, I will explain how we significantly reduce the unreasonable resource consumption of the GPU with stress tests.How to do stress testing?It must be clarified that since a traffic simulation map is the mapping and restoration of the real world, it depends on various data sources, including point cloud data, tilt photography, satellite images, panoramic images, aerial video, etc. However, these real data are more or less problematic, so a secondary design is needed to achieve accurate geographic location, matching regional style, and smooth operation efficiency.We conduct research with our accumulated blank model testing data to evaluate the integration of the road network and the surface, and calculate a set of map segmentation schemes to facilitate the program to efficiently load each atomic map, thereby enabling transportation functions to make more flexible. In addition, we subdivide the smooth meshes to no less than 3 times, simulate no less than 100 dynamic vehicles and no less than 100 moving pedestrians, and adapt complex coloring and high-precision textures to the components of the blank model for specific tests. At the same time, we add greenery of no less than 5000 types to verify the frame rate of static scenes. 。We group the testing according to the types of rendering, such as road networks, buildings, vegetation, etc., and strictly control the budget after stress testing, in order to improve the team’s efficiency, thereby shortening the development cycle. It is worth noting that even without ForceCulling, LOD, and HLOD, the current stress test method we use is generally very efficient, because this method can quickly assess the impact of the asset on the map rendering and quickly calculate the budget for various types of resources such as buildings, roads, surfaces, vehicles, and pedestrians, so as to reserve more space for dynamic functions.When the stress testing is done abundantly, we can optimize the product for different situations. Next, I will talk about the difficulties in restoring the road network. The road network should reveal the complexity of the real road, such as the undulating conditions of the road surface, the changes of the intersections, etc. Meanwhile, it should be able to meet different needs of smart transportation such as parallel computing, sensor simulation, vehicle dynamics, etc. Therefore, the production of a traffic simulation road network cannot be done simply with the curve editing tool of Spline.51WORLD independently developed the WorldEditor to automate the geometric data and UV mapping of a road network, thus greatly improving the efficiency of producing a road network, on which a whole simulated world can be developed.OpenDrive road network file exported by WorldEditorAt present, our team is capable of producing large maps of 100 square kilometers, and we aspire to rapidly recreate larger maps of several square kilometers and construct the road network of thousands of kilometers. Next, I will talk about how to effectively integrate digital assets in producing maps.02 Integrating digital assets in the “Big World”An integrated display of various digital assets in stress testing mapsThe Big World is a combination of small cell maps, each containing a huge number of digital assets. Different projects have different acceptance criteria. Now, we integrate digital assets mainly in two directions: one is to add semantics, and the other is to lighten heavy assets.Adding semantics to digital assets: assets used in sensor simulation are typical heavyweight digital assets and of the highest level. As time and weather vary, semantic information should be added to meet different requirements of sensor recognition training, such as the parameter of wet and dry environment changes, snow stains coverage parameters, etc. Up till now, we have processed more than 40 semantic heavyweight digital asset types, which maximizes the restoration of object properties and material changes in the real world.The lightening of heavy assets is often used for the rapid retrieval and use of assets. For example, the digital assets loaded in the WorldEditor need to be lightweight. At the appearance, it seems feasible to make multiple versions of assets to meet different needs. However, the extremely high costs put off even the most fervent tech-lovers.Therefore, we define varied requirements in different levels of LOD, encapsulate these assets with BP, upgrade and downgrade them more flexibly, adapt appendages, and replace materials to support sensor simulation, case testing, and vehicle dynamics.For example, we divide the attributes of real-world vehicles into static and dynamic. In the static dimension, lightweight assets need a reasonable structure, a low number of faces, and a small number of materials, while heavyweight assets need to be clearly structured with rich materials and realistic textures. Meanwhile, both of them can flexibly add appendages, such as bus license plates, advertising stickers, warning lamps, etc. In the dynamic dimension, the first consideration should be given to adapt corresponding skeleton animations to different levels, restrict the luminous intensity, and control the number of particles, etc. Therefore, flexible upgrades, downgrades as well as adaption become the kernel of making composite assets.03 Establishing a composite digital asset libraryA digital asset library is the smallest unit to build a map. Whether a single asset meets the rendering standards in the field of traffic products directly affects the performance of a simulated map, which determines the feasibility of constructing a big world. Therefore, it is instrumental to build a composite digital asset library. We assess digital assets in terms of aesthetics, compliance, and feasibility.Aesthetics: we should evaluate whether a digital asset faithfully restores the properties of objects in the real world, such as surface materials, size ratio, etc. and whether a digital asset meets the public aesthetic standards. For example, we construct pedestrian characters with 3D footage from live scanning and create behavioral actions from action sequences generated by Motion Capture, to make them more credible and beautiful.Compliance: The compliance of a digital asset will have a direct impact on the cost of its subsequent iteration. The assessment of compliance not only includes models and materials but also hidden functions such as vertex shading, the role of multiple sets of UV, model LOD, physical materials collision occludes, luminous parts, multi-dimensional sub-materials, bones, audio code rate, animation frame rate, particle size range, source file format, naming rules, storage location, etc.Feasibility: When a digital asset is referenced by a map, first it must be flexibly used by the level designer. And the second modification will not lead to repeated revision and construction of the level. Last, it can be modularly combined into a new resource. The gist lies in whether an asset has been dismantled carefully in the early stages of production.A diagram of the composition of digital assets.In static environment simulation for intelligent transportation and autonomous driving, the closest visual distance of a digital asset should be less than 1m, which is highly dependent on the digital asset library. The asset should be able to be displayed on multiple platforms, such as PC-based VR, MR and XR, and the access of cloud rendering also needs to consider the size of the resource package. It emphasizes the functions and effects, but the digital asset needs to be lightened, the seemingly contradictory requirement of which also exists in the film and game industry.9 categories of digital assets.Our digital asset library consists of nine categories that assume the largest elements of the real world. Each category is divided into no less than 8 sub-levels. In principle, any static digital asset should be dynamically scalable. Therefore, we’ve reserved the functional interfaces, such as LOD, UV, materials, and vertex information for a static 3D model, so that engineers can freely combine the tools into dynamic elements available, which are, of course, part of the asset library.The proportion of working hours after cleaning the original non-standard digital assets of the vehicle to meet different functionsSince simulating each 3D asset in the virtual environment takes a large amount of time, it is unattainable to process every digital asset to be extremely aesthetical. If we grade the digital assets of film and games at 10, these required by the digital twin can only get 6. It also seems realistic to remove redundant artistic details and return the models, textures, and materials to the original state.The composite digital assets commonly used for transportation projectsAlthough we don’t agree with each other in aesthetics, I believe that digital twins must meet the basic standards, such as the blue sky on a sunny day, reflections on the surface of the water, etc. How to strike a balance between intuition and emotion is the basis for defining digital assets, which is also bound up with costs.04 Rendering efficiency on multiple platformsDue to the secondary design of the maps, performance stress testing, and the maintenance of standardized composite digital assets, the rendering efficiency of transportation simulation projects we delivered in multiple platforms is generally up to standards, even outperforming peer products. At present, intelligent transportation and autonomous driving simulation projects are mostly based on the PC platform. Against this backdrop, how to realize efficient rendering on other platforms such as 5G cloud rendering streaming, VR and MR poses another challenge for the industry.In addition to the scale of the map, the digital asset itself and the toolchain also affect rendering efficiency. Just like running, being able to run is one thing, but to run fast is another. It is not easy to run with data and functions. Of digital assets, different perspectives, models, textures, materials, lights, motion sequences, special effects, sound effects, UI, etc. also have an impact on rendering efficiency.The path design of the dynamic camera in the large traffic simulation map.How to improve the rendering efficiency of the simulated maps? It is ideal to work with lightened maps on high-performance PCs.Currently, we have achieved the following goals in traffic projects based on PC hardware:[Successful implementation cases]Up to now, our team has guaranteed the frame rate in the L4 static simulation maps of hundreds of square kilometers (51WORLD all-element scenes are divided into five levels from L1 to L5, with the scenes of L4-L5 being able to restore detailed elements such as roads, traffic facilities, vehicles, and pedestrians), and it has been verified on recent large projects.L1-L5 all-element scenes of the static simulationA microsimulation of rapid roadA micro-simulation of a blockA meso-simulation of smart trafficA macro-simulation of a transportation hubIn making the micro-simulation map of the traffic in Beijing’s West Third Ring, we covered a total mileage of 30 kilometers from Wanliu Bridge to Suzhou Bridge and 10 kilometers of branch roads, restoring a whole area of 400 square kilometers.Thanks to the building capability of large scenes, we have adopted the WorldMap, a construction approach particularly helpful for building linear road maps, which enables us freely load and cull target levels while changing multiple camera positions, making it easier to balance the performances between multiple sub-maps.The steps of producing the linear road network of Beijing’s West Third RingPart.2 Seeking truth in detail and infinitely approaching the realTransportation simulation aims for being realistic. If we personify a product, saying it has bones and flesh after solving the four major challenges above, the game doesn’t stop here. We want to make it more lifelike by perfecting the product in terms of macro geographic information, micro scenes management and dynamic systems.A corner of the traffic case map01 Restoring real geographic informationFrom the macroscopic dimension, the rules of constructing in the real-world should be applied in a virtual simulation, to ensure the authenticity of the simulated environment to the greatest extent.The order of simulation is similar to that of the actual construction. First of all, in terms of geographical information, we should consider the earth’s latitude, longitude, time and weather, and reserve the real natural environment of mountains, rivers and lakes. Then, a piece of land is allocated to plan the road network, followed by the generation of different types of buildings. Finally, we scrutinize the details of the network, such as the road-related facilities and greening off the roads.The 1:1 restoration of the Jiading demonstration area of the National Intelligent Network02 Subdivided scene categoriesWe divide static simulation into more than 20 categories from the microscopic dimension, each with different priorities. Here are some major categories: geographical type, road type, road marking, traffic-related equipment, roadside facilities, main vehicles and traffic flow, pedestrians and animals, weather and time, and display perspectives. 51WORLD has subdivided toolchains for each category and we will consider the real situation of different projects. Taking the geographical type as an example: as Guangzhou is closer to the equator than Beijing, their green plants, surface textures, and light and shadow changes vary significantly.The details of the static simulation of traffic-related facilities such as traffic lights, signs, radar speed measurement, etc. are easily overlooked, but 51WORLD has been constantly enriching and accumulating different styles. Apart from following the national standards, we underline the features in various regions. For example, the traffic lights in Beijing is of standard cylindrical shape, the lights in Shanghai have curved angles while these in Shenzhen have eaves like wearing a beret.Categories divided according to the applied scenarios03 A complete dynamic systemStatic environment simulation needs a dynamic system to be faithful and realistic. We compare the dynamic systems of traffic flow, pedestrian flow, weather, and time changes as the neural networks in intelligent traffic simulation. Time and weather systems have the highest adhesion to static environment simulation.People who has had offline rendering experience know that even if the world is made of white boxes, GI and lighting can make it real, good-looking and credible. Therefore, this technique can be capitalized on in real-time rendering. Light and shadow directly affect people’s perception. Continued improvement of light tracing technology will inevitably push environmental simulation to a higher level.Perfect time and weather functions enable the R &amp; D team to define traffic cases more accurately. Traditional real-time rendering engine fails to fully support the access and connection of real data, although in which dynamic weather and time are gradually improved. For example, if the customer asks for some rainfall in a sunny environment at 12, or vaguely seeing the outline of the sun in a cloudy evening, in the past, we have to produce the time and weather separately. However, as the demands surge, the lack of relevant tools will seriously reduce work efficiency and output quality. Besides, it will be very unfriendly to the semantic recognition of the sensors.Therefore, our content team designed a time and weather system based on current project types, in which we set 8 common kinds of weather and 12 extreme conditions, reserved the interfaces of time, material, special effects, and animation. The secondary development of these functions will enable flexible utilization of 51Sim-One, and meet the customers’ highly customized needs for time and weather to the greatest extent. Now the senior programmers on the engineering team are working hard to upgrade this tool to make it handier in the future.The 24-hour changing effect of the time system in the smart transportation projectTime and weather system effectsAt present, our team can freely switch from process to quality control in static simulation, make realistic virtual scenes, and deliver the product in time. We believe that in the future, with the continuous iteration of lighting, materials, animation and other technologies in real-time rendering, the simulated maps, and dynamic effects will be presented as more real. In this regard, we organize regular training courses to keep the members in touch with the latest trends in the industry and aspire to sharpen our competitive edge.</span>

<div class="news_about">All Free! 51WORLD Digital Twin Developer Platform WDP3.0 was Officially Released!</div>
<span class="index-content">On April 7, 51WORLD released the latest digital twin developer platform WDP3.0, which provides an important help to promote the technology popularization and ecological construction of digital twin in all walks of life.The press conference was held at AI TOWER, which is the latest R&amp;D headquarters of 51WORLD in China and the landmark of Shanghai Science and technology.Technology Popularization and Free Opening of Digital Twin Developer PlatformWDP 3.0, a new version of digital twin developer platform of 51WORLD, integrates and packages the key development tools of digital twin, which has strong universality and usability.According to Li Yi, Founder and CEO of 51WORLD, WDP 3.0 has achieved three major upgrades. The first is the all-element scene template for rich industries. All-element scene (AES) is the core product of 51WORLD, which has the characteristics of large-scale generation, high-precision restoration and dynamic synchronization, and has been widely used in all walks of life. WDP3.0 has built-in 15 digital twin templates of different industries, covering more than 10 industrial scenes such as city, transportation, community, water, factory, port, power station, subway, etc. In the future, the template in WDP will continue to be updated and more industry scenes will be added to help more ecological partners complete the digital twin upgrade. Secondly, the tool chain on WDP3.0 platform gives developers the ability to build zero-code / low-code services. By simply dragging and clicking, users can quickly assemble business panels. It is worth mentioning that the platform also has built-in more than ten typical industry templates, users can call on this basis with one key, which greatly reduces the time cost of development from scratch.Finally, relying on the powerful cloud service capability, WDP3.0 platform can realize the whole process and one-stop management of digital twin application development, release and management. Through the development platform, high-precision digital twin products can be demonstrated on the large screen of the exhibition hall, and can also be smoothly presented on mobile terminals such as mobile phones and Pads, which greatly improves the universality of digital twin technology. WDP3.0 also adapts the domestic software and hardware, which can be better compatible with the domestic development and application environment.From now on, the community version of the above products will be fully open for free!Accelerating the Integration of Digital Twin Industry EcologyFrom the date of its birth, digital twin is a technology that pursues cooperation and collaboration. The National Development and Reform Commission and the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the “Implementation Plan on Promoting the “Cloud Based Digital Intelligence” Campaign and Cultivating the Development of a New Economy”, and proposed “focusing on the difficulties and pain points in the specialization of digital twins, and guiding all parties to participate in the solution of digital twin.”As a digital twin platform company, 51WORLD has always been working with partners to create an industry application ecosystem, build tech-based ecology, and share digital twin dividends around its core capabilities.CETC Digital Intelligence Technology Co., Ltd is a new generation of information infrastructure operator jointly funded by central enterprises, local state-owned assets and social capital in Shanghai. It has closed cooperation with 51WORLD in smart city, smart Park and other fields. Guan Jun Wei, Vice President of the company, said 51WORLDis a reliable digital twin partner with strong strength, outstanding ability and professional team. Founded by Academician Li Deren and Academician Gong Jianya in 1999, GeoStar is a leading enterprise in the field of geographic information in China. Huang Jinson, Senior Vice President of the company said that it will integrate technical products with 51WORLD through joint research and development, so as to deeply integrate professional geographic information system and digital twin technology. A domestic GPU chip design company, Moore Threads, known as the “Dream Team of China Chip”, also came to the scene. Dong Longfei, General Manager of the GPU Product Division of Moore Threads, pointed out that digital twin technology and the development of high-performance general-purpose computing power represented by GPU support each other and will become an important force in the development of digital China in the future.Also present at the conference were well-known domestic companies such as Huawei and SenseTime, as well as foreign technology companies such as Unreal. 51WORLD’s vision is to clone the earth, which requires the participation of excellent developers and ecological partners from all over the world. 51WORLD is firmly committed to the platform strategy. On one hand, the company has maintained rapid growth over the years through the flywheel of product technology, platform ecology and customer value. On the other hand, as a cutting-edge and emerging technology, digital twin is in the key process of popularization and marketization. 51WORLD hopes to accelerate the development of digital twin technology and fully create its value through the way of open platform ecology. WDP3.0 is not only a development platform, but also an open world built by digital twin technology.Brilliant Future, AI + Digital Twin Resonates HereOn the same day, 51WORLD R&amp;D Headquarters officially settled in Shanghai Xuhui landmark building — AI TOWER.Li Yi said that in recent years, the company has made continuous breakthroughs in the integration and innovation of digital twin technology, and constantly expanded in the fields of smart city, smart transportation, smart manufacturing and other industries.

<div class="news_about">Professor Gao Yanli: Digital Twin Opens the Door of a Wonderful Era</div>
<span class="index-content">Editor’s note：With the rollout of state policies as well as the setup of national new areas such as Xiong’an, the digital twin has penetrated into all aspects of the smart city from the traditional manufacturing industry, greatly enriching people’s imagination of the future urban form.Meanwhile, we should fully understand the complexity of digital twin technology. Enterprises that underestimate the difficulties of implementing digital twin, being reluctant to invest in R&amp;D and unwilling to seek industrial collaboration, are unlikely to succeed or go too far in the market.In this article, we are honored to invite Professor Gao Yanli, chief expert of a smart city at the CAICT, a scientific research institution directly under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), to catch a glimpse of this splendid digital twin world and envision the future direction of digital twin technology.Gao Yanli, chief expert of a smart city at the CAICTDigital twins can be regarded as the quintessence of the digital age. The straightforward and prevalent concept that combines the virtual and the real opens the door of intelligence, providing people with new insights into understanding and changing the world even without venturing out.Digital twin cities successfully address the two issues of smart city architecture integration and governance collaboration, pushing the construction of smart cities to new heights. However, we should be sober that digital twin technology is complex and the industry should not blindly follow the trend. We ought to be persistent in creating the hard-core products of digital twins, to be worthy of this exquisite, mysterious and wonderful digital twin era.01 The digital twin revolutionizes the worldThe digital twin is prevailing in various industries. It has been a buzzword in the last two or three years at home and abroad, with a stunning number of studies and researches. The concept has been identified by many institutions as one of the top strategic technology trends that affect the world.National ministries such as the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Ministry of Science and Technology, rolled out policies and supporting programs to promote the basic research and applications of digital twins in the industrial and urban fields. Local governments are scrambling to build the first digital twin city while the industry is racing to come up with the latest digital twin solutions in order to take the lead in this cutting-edge technology.The digital twin has permeated the society in fields of the government, industries, factories, and cities. It has become the law of digital development about which everyone is talking about. That’s why the industries, capitals, and policies are rushing into this technology.Digital twins are indeed popular now.Conceptually, the digital twin reaches a wide range of audiences in only a couple of years as the buzzword is vivid and straightforward. Technologically, the ever-changing information technologies have made most people deeply convinced in the vision of digital twins. From single-point applications to integrated innovations, the digital twin is the milestone in China’s information-oriented development, and it may be the starting point of humans striding into the intelligent era. Exciting roads await.In terms of values, as China is reforming its administrative system, constructing a city of digital twin will reshape the urban digital genes and modernize the governance system. The digital twin redefines intelligent industrial parks, creating a new model of multi-dimensional performance management while the digital twin factories provide the best solutions for digitalizing the whole procedure of manufacturing including design, production, and assembling. As for the digital twin of the human body, it is opening up a new world of medical services with its unique perspective.Digital twin transforms the world. As the ancient Chinese Sage Lao Tse once stated that all things under heaven sprung from the existed and the existed sprung from the non-existed, the digital twin exemplifies the relationship of the existed and the non-existed in virtualizing the real world.The ubiquitous perception and integration, the interaction between the virtual and the real, they support and complement each other. The digital twin enables accurate mapping and perceptive insights even without venturing outside. In controlling the moving with the static and manipulating the real with the virtual, digital twin maps out influential strategies based on the intangible.Digital twin changes the industry rules, optimizes the development path and remodels operation, providing new ideas, perspectives and methods for various industries. It greatly shortens the development path of the industry and triggers profound technological changes in the industry’s systems, mechanisms, structures and rules. In digitalizing everything from macro to micro, a digital twin is pivotal in revolutionizing the world.02 Digital twin reshapes the governance systemThough significant progress has been made in the system cloud and data sharing, smart city construction still hits two bottlenecks, one in technology integration and the other in governance collaboration. Most intelligent city construction is still in its infancy of industrial information building, for want of technical and business architectures for the integrated urban governance. Hardware and software infrastructure, data, algorithms, technical capabilities, toolsets, and block applications are difficult to be incorporated into one architecture, to form a scalable functional system for further iteration. A vacuum exists in discrete, ineffective and inefficient managing systems. It is a daunting task to synchronize the management of different regions, lines and blocks.Digital twin reconstructs the overall architecture of smart cities. In terms of technologies, the digital twin city model platform incorporates the underlying infrastructure, static and dynamic data, core system and technical capability, applications and supporting system, achieving collaborative governance and the integration of the real and the virtual. The underlying infrastructure, consisting of traditional information infrastructure and the new infrastructure, reshapes the urban digital genes and creates an intelligent operating environment with its powerful abilities to perceive, transmit, compute and control.Therefore, the advent of digital twin cities provides an opportunity for and chart the course of reconstructing the overall architecture of a smart city and specifies the levels and paths of integration. By establishing a collaborative platform of the urban brain, the digital twin city connects the systems of urban management, ecological governance, traffic control, market supervision, emergency response, public security, etc.Driven by major events and special scenarios, based on the digital twin city model platform and equipped with its integrated data, algorithms and tools, the digital twin city is able to formulate a closed-loop procedure of proactive awareness, preemptive governance, and optimized plan, realizing coordinated management of urban governance.Digital twin virtualizes public services. Typical features such as global vision, accurate mapping, simulation, virtual-real interaction and intelligent intervention of digital twin cities are accelerating the innovation of urban governance and services, bringing about a number of super applications with a global perspective.As the representative scenarios of digital twin cities lie mostly in urban governance, such as planning, constructing, ecosystem, market and traffic, the unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19 expedites the digitalization of the whole society and speeds up the implementation of virtualized public services. Digitalized contactless post-Internet life experiences such as online education, medical treatment and cultural performances greatly enrich the life of the public and give the citizens more choices. In the future, the urban form will lean towards digital aggregation and physical separation.The digital twin is devoted to improving modern governance. The COVID-19 pandemic exposes serious deficiencies in the global governance system such as the incapable emergency response mechanism, inadequate disease control plans, inaccurate information release, lagging public opinion guidance, inadequate resource allocation and insufficient decision-making ability. Although smart cities have played a significant role in containing the epidemic, the problems of unscheduled resources, unanalyzed data, unorganized manpower and inefficient network persist. Cooperative citizens and responsible local governments have become the backbone of China’s fighting against the epidemic.As Lao Tse pointed out that action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance and order should be secured before disorder has begun, the all-element expression, visualization of multidimensional data and scenes, spatial computing, overlaying analysis, simulation and remote control of the digital twin city as well as the derived abilities to identify urban risks, observing city operation, tracking trajectory, controlling events, deducing, simulating emergency plans and allocating resources, echo with the demands of modern governance in innovation, coordination, prevention, supervision and organization, making it a major booster for improving the governance system.The wave of new infrastructure is accelerating the development of digital twin cities. Previously, the precise mapping and virtual-real interaction of a digital twin city were largely dependent on the IoT, and as China’s new infrastructure unfolds, it has expanded to assimilate all the components of the new infrastructure, including 5G, IoT, edge computing, data centers, as well as the intelligent transformation of municipal facilities, industrial equipment and public services.By means of intensive spatial layout, the city will form a new overall structure of ubiquitous identifying, perceiving, connecting and computing, to intelligently define everything. It will unleash the operations and services of the infrastructure for the public, enabling the digital transformation of all walks of life.The massive construction of the new infrastructure will greatly lower the cost of building a digital twin city and strongly support the simultaneous operation of the virtual and the real, thus speeding up the construction of the digital twin city.03 The journey of digital twins: a long way to goTo implement a digital twin is more complex than imagined. Enormous basic theories need to be deeply studied, the huge number of technical solutions need to be explored, massive application scenarios need to be verified and colossal mechanisms need to break through before a digital twin really accomplishes precise mapping, twin parallel and the virtual serving the real, be it a factory, a city or a human body.The digital twin is a tremendous project of intellectual integration of knowledge, technologies, data, algorithms, tools and applications, thereby needing a powerful supporting industrial ecology.For creating a digital twin city, depicting the appearance is one thing, while accurately expressing the city’s content, personality, characteristics and rules with technical means such as models, data, algorithms and tools, is another. In the underlying new infrastructure, the lack of reasonable plans and specifications for the intensive layout of urban space, the invisible social relationships between urban elements and the uncertainty of operating rules are all insurmountable obstacles for digital twin cities.Some domestic enterprises are more inclined to earn fast money. They churn out low-quality products, invest little on R&amp;D and are reluctant to go deep into technological innovation. Some ride the tide of digital twins after the concept has been popularized.Instead of actively exploring the technology, they labeled the existing products as digital twins and introduced them into the market, seriously disrupting the industry and confusing public understanding. Given the complexity of digital twins, enterprises that underestimate the difficulties of implementing digital twin, being reluctant to invest in R&amp;D and unwilling to seek industrial collaboration, are unlikely to succeed or go too far in the market.Currently, it is pressing to construct the digital twin cities while the technical solutions are far from mature. Although some encouraging progress has been made in visualizing city modeling, there is still a long way to go. Therefore, in order to promote the implementation of digital twin cities, on the one hand, the government should actively unleash the data and related resources to pave the way for piloting digital twin cities. On the other hand, the mechanisms should be integrated to establish adaptive organizational and business structures.The industry should actively build a complementarily cooperative ecology, to consistently verify the implementation of the solutions. Scientific research institutions should lead their way in innovation and strengthen relevant visionary basic research, removing the obstacles for governments and industries in implementing the digital twin cities.Never forget why you started, and you can accomplish your mission. Like every revolutionary technology, digital twin cities were questioned at the very beginning. People worried that in the gigantic network of a digital twin city, the city’s activities would all be under surveillance. It will be like a digital prison in which the citizens lose privacy and their actions are monitored. The concern is not without reason. For brutal managers, a digital twin city might be a disaster for the people but for the righteous ones, a digital twin city will increase the well-being of the people.Powerful technical means make the city smarter, more harmonious and efficient and the service more diverse, convenient, proactive and personalized. The management of the intelligent city is shifting from governance to services. In constructing a digital twin city, only by elevating the well-being of the people can it go far and steadily in the future.Digital twins open the door of understanding and changing the world, pushing digitalization and intelligent transformation to an admirable height. It might be substituted by more advanced technology later, but fortunately, the new wonderful era has just begun. Let us embrace it and create a bright future together!</span>

<div class="news_about">51WORLD Launches Digital Twin Water Industry Line</div>
<span class="index-content">More than 70 % of the surface of this blue planet we live on is covered by water. For 51WORLD, to make a digital twin of the water is an important step towards cloning the earth.Generally, China’s water resources are insufficient and they vary greatly in different regions and seasons. Therefore, it is imperative for us to ensure the safety of people’s lives and property in the event of floods, to utilize water resources efficiently, and to protect the water environment effectively.To simulate water bodies is extremely difficult as it often involves processing massive data and entails a complex governance system that affects each other. The technical bottleneck of incorporating watersheds, rivers, lakes, and reservoir pipelines into one scene and the lack of digital twin models further compound the simulation.▲Digital twin simulation of the rise and fall of the water levelsSince last year, with the support of all-element scenarios and cooperated with leading partners in water services, 51WORLD has gone deep into the information technology, bringing new ideas and new technologies to the industry.51WORLD believes that the natural waters and urban pipeline networks will be manageable in the same scene, multi-source data will be visualized and replicated in digital twin scenarios, which helps the personnel respond quickly and makes the public better understand the water industry.Therefore, 51WORLD has launched the digital twin industry line of major application scenarios such as urban water supply, flood defense, drought relief, and ecological governance, which has been landed in a number of provinces and cities at home and abroad.01 Water Resources Protection and Ecological ManagementClear waters and green mountains are as good as mountains of gold and silver. As water protection has become a manifesto of the Chinese government, 51WORLD makes a digital twin of the watersheds, rivers and water bodies in the natural ecology, and provides targeted solutions for ecological management, pollution sources control, indicators monitoring and flood defense.Among them, the “Three Smart Lakes” of Yunnan Province, 51WORLD’s major industry project in the field of water environmental protection, enables the administrators to deduce the water quality to observe the distribution of pollutants in the lake over a period of time and displays the tributaries impacting the lake’s mid-point water quality to trace the pollutants.▲Scene replication of 3000 square kilometersThree Smart Lakes is a key project under the direction of the Fuxian Lake Administration of Yuxi City and guided by Yunnan Provincial Committee. It is an implementation of the action plan of strengthening ecological environment protection by the Yunnan Province and a concrete measure of protecting the nine lakes on the plateau.In a few weeks, together with local water management enterprises and environmental protection research institute, 51WORLD quickly replicated a total of nearly 3,000 square kilometers of digital twin scenes of Fuxian Lake, Xingyun Lake, Qilu Lake, and surrounding watersheds, and built a set of ecological supervision system, facilitating systematic perception, scientific decision-making, resourceful management, and effective operation. In the project, 51WORLD constructed a system to monitor and perceive the water, environment, meteorology, and soil conditions, which were presented in digital twin scenes.▲The rise of the lake modelThe system loaded the water quality data collected by the sensors deployed in the lake and visualized them with different shades of colors according to the degree of water pollution. At the same time, the system demonstrated the changes in water quality in a given period with the analyzed results over time displaying on both sides of the panels.By replicating the water quality and the impact of the surrounding rivers on the lake, the managers were capable of visually observing the water quality of the lake and quickly making corresponding measures.▲Water pollution deductionWater volume is one of the key indicators of monitoring the water. The digital twin “Three Smart Lakes” could detect and track the flows and volumes of the lake and its tributaries, displaying the whole process and elements of water resources utilization. In addition to replicating the present, the system was able to predict to some extent.Equipped with the water model algorithm and combined with the visual scenes, 51WORLD could predict the changes of water volumes, the evolution of water pollution and environment protection tendencies, enabling the managers to watch the predicted results in person.Ecological law enforcement is another daily task of the water management department. By accessing the cameras, the intelligent law enforcement module of the system connected the virtual scenes with the real scenes in order to monitor the later in real-time.As for the UAVs and unmanned ships, the system mapped out real-time patrol routes in the digital twin scenes of the lakes and realistically represented the law enforcement process from a third perspective, thus helping reasonable allocation of the task forces and ensuring water safety and ecological stability.Intelligent law enforcement simulation Similar to the “Three Smart Lakes”, other intelligent water projects can realize the rapid embedding and two-way interaction of all-element 3D scenes on the webpage by accessing the third-party Web of 51WORLD SuperAPI, to flexibly get the eco-environmental protection data of the administration bureau for the system’s subsequent development and data update.02 Urban water supply, drainage, and flood defenseWater supply and drainage systems are indispensable for urban planning. Relying on its cutting-edge digital twin capability, 51WORLD replicates urban water supply and drainage networks, sewage treatment plants, and the distribution of rivers and lakes in the 3D scenes of urban construction, providing the basis for making relevant decisions.On the digital twin backplane, 51WORLD represents the water supply areas, sources of the water, pumping stations, distribution points, pipeline network directions, and water plant locations, providing assistance for decision-makers in planning the water supply system.▲A planning map of the water supply systemApart from replicating the scenes, the digital twin can display the locations of water plants in 3D scenes in the form of POI, and get access to crucial water quality indicators such as the color, turbidity, residual chlorine, chemical oxygen demand, total bacteria, total coliforms, heat-resistant coliforms, etc., to ensure the security of urban water supply.At the same time, real-time video information such as UAVs patrolling and fixed-point cameras in key areas of water sources can also be connected to the digital twin system, to identify emergencies such as intrusion and water pollution. As flood defense is closely related to the lives and properties of the people, it charts the course of digital twin water applications. At present, 51WORLD is able to provide emergency demonstrations, real-time surveillance in flood-prone areas, and evacuation in disaster-stricken regions.▲Flood inundation analysisThese features have been well received by customers overseas. In the Singapore Smart City Management System, a digital twin built for Singapore’s top developer Surbana Jurong and the Singaporean Government, 51WORLD replicated the scenes of the whole nation, in which it deduced different scopes of the inundated urban areas according to different scales of floods and visualized them in 3D, providing assistance for decision-makers in fighting against the floods.03 The advent of the digital twin water industry2020 marks the last year of the “13th Five-Year Plan” for promoting water conservancy towards informatization in China. According to the plan, China aims to build a water conservancy system featuring intelligent water applications, open information, intensive infrastructure, safe network, and optimized security across China by the end of this year. China’s water conservancy informationization has been full-fledged since then. As the plan unfolds, the digital twin applications of water conservancy also usher in their achievements.In terms of technologies, The Internet of Things, big data and cloud computing are gradually being assimilated into the water conservancy industry, promoting the construction of China’s command system of flood and drought defense, and the establishment of the backbone networks across China while the intelligent models have been operated in major projects such as flood forecasting and cross-region water diversion.In addition, geographic information, water networks and water conservancy projects are incorporated into one scene since numerous water monitoring terminals have collected massive relevant data. In short, the improvement of the IoT devices and water information networks has laid the foundation for applying digital twin in the water industry.▲Swan Lake smart water solutionsAs for governmental funds, the state is encouraging more investment into water informationization. In 2017, the total amount of China’s investment in water conservancy information technologies reached about 21.29 billion yuan while in 2018, the number came up to 24.05 billion yuan. Research institute predicted that it would grow at a CAGR of around 12% from 2018 to 2023.On the other hand, investment in water ecological management went up year by year. The State Council issued an Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution in 2015, in which it expected that about 4 to 5 trillion yuan were needed by 2020 to achieve corresponding targets, of which the local governments were required to contribute about 1.5 trillion yuan. In terms of demands, more than 1.2 million river chiefs and rangers have been installed across China as a strategic measure to reform the ecological system and build a beautiful China.It is a market of huge potentials and it is promising to carry out water management efficiency in the digital twin scenarios. In addition, the public becomes increasingly concerned about water quality, urban drainage, the treatment of polluted waters and ecological protection. It is also necessary for water administrators to respond to public concerns in a digital way. All these have contributed to pushing 51WORLD to further promote the digital twin industry line of the water businesses.Relying on its original digital twin technology, 51WORLD will continue to forge in-depth cooperation with industry partners and put forward more effective and down-to-earth water solutions, to build a smart bridge between “clear waters and green mountains” and “mountains of gold and silver”.</span>

<div class="news_about">Another National Benchmark Landed! 51WORLD Helps Nanjing Jiangbei New Area to Build the First Digital Twin City</div>
<span class="index-content">June 7 marked the official completion of the smart city command center of the CBD in Jiangbei New Area.▲The handover ceremonyThe system, co-developed by 51WORLD and Nanjing Unicom, portrayed the landscape, presented the trend, and deduced the future of the area with the most advanced digital twin technology in China. Equipped with various sensors and incorporated with the 5G network, NB-IoT, BIM, and AI, the digital twin CBD was able to achieve global awareness, data sharing, cross command, and accurate feedback.▲The digital twin CBD in Jiangbei New AreaAt the handover ceremony, Wang Dongning, the CBD office director, said that the construction of the CBD smart city manifested the CBD had always attached great importance to high techs, and he emphasized that in the future, information integration technology should be assimilated into the technical means, working methods and achievements presentation.Wang Dongning further pointed out that the smart city command center was a bold venture into the combination of information technology, computer system, decision-making system, and visual image processing technology.01 The first digital twin cityAs one of the 19 state-level new areas approved by the State Council and the only one in Jiangsu Province, Nanjing Jiangbei New Area strategically positions itself as the pilot area of innovation, the demonstration area for new-type urbanization, the hub for modern industries in the Yangtze River Delta region and the major platform for opening-up and cooperation in Yangtze River Economic Belt.According to a 2019 district guideline on smart city construction, Nanjing Jiangbei New Area aspired to construct itself as the first digital twin city in China by 2025, promoting the virtualization of city elements, real-time urban operation and coordinated smart governance with digital twin technology.Against this backdrop, a smart city command center with the major functions of smart construction, intelligent governance and enterprise service came into being. Utilizing 51UrbanData digital backplane construction technology, 51WORLD restored the large scenes of the 25.4 square kilometers of the CBD and meticulously presented core areas such as the Health Center and Qinglong Green Belt and major transportation hubs such as the Dingshan overpass and Jiangbei Avenue Expressway. Overlaid with the dynamic traffic flow, the digital twin CBD represented a lively picture of its real-world counterpart.▲Jiangbei Avenue Expressway02 Smart construction: the present and the future of urban constructionAs Nanjing aims to build another city center around the CBD, a large number of high-standard projects have sprung up in recent years. In order to better manage urban construction, the smart city system accurately presented the qualities and progress of the projects in real-time.A global view of the large scenes of the 25.4 square kilometers in the CBD was generated in the digital twin scenario. As for a specific area, viewers could see corresponding information such as functional area planning, land planning, municipal infrastructure construction, and project progress, with urban planning legends indicating different natures of land utilization.▲International Health Center planningThe system displayed the details of the key projects with data panels, including construction and management information, progress warning, equipment access on the site, etc.In terms of progress management, it adopted the BIM model to visually show the progress of the project and distinguish between the undone and the completed, presenting an unobstructed picture of progress status and providing a comparison of the planned and actual progress.▲BIM model for projects under construction5G-supported UAVs, a feature of the smart city construction, could patrol specific lines and respond to emergencies. As the eye of the sky in the CBD, the drones were able to observe the traffic conditions on the ground, take photos and videos of emergencies, monitor the construction at any time, distinguish the cover situation of the naked soil, and identify illegal construction.03 Smart governance: down-to-earth functions after numerous tryoutsSmart governance consisted of city management, urban security, and environmental protection. Equipped with terminal IoT sensors or other data devices, the system generated relevant warnings after background judgment, which were incorporated into the digital twin backplane for presentation.▲Parking managementIn terms of urban management, the system had designed down-to-earth functions such as city environment supervision, dirt trucks regulation and parking control. Similar consideration was also given to modules of urban security and environmental protection.▲Dust controlTaking dust control as an example, the viewer could check the index in real-time and the system would issue an alarm if anything unusual happened. Then the managers were notified to deal with the event, achieving the closed-loop of processing.“Each function is then modified demand of the team and the CBD office after repeated investigation, research, and communication. In this process, the CBD office gets more and more expectant of the smart city system while the system itself becomes increasingly perfect and down to earth,” commented Zheng Yingya of the 51WORLD Digital City Division.04 Digital twins continue to boost Jiangbei New Area constructionNanjing Jiangbei New Area has previously proposed to deliver the best service and build the most intelligent city by 2021. Wang Dongning, the CBD office director, pointed out that there were three hurdles to overcome for the future development of the smart city system.First, how to make the system play a greater role on the basis of existing functions, to better fit the regional development of the CBD in scope as well as in-depth;Second, how to wisely combine technology with management, organization, and processing procedures;Third, how to engage more people, institutions, and enterprises into building the intelligent city system.▲Restoration of regional landmark buildingsIn the future, 51WORLD will maintain close cooperation with Nanjing Unicom to continuously provide top-notch digital twin service for the smart city system of the CBD in Jiangbei New Area, and, with its original technology, make a contribution to modernizing and transforming Jiangbei New Area.</span>

<div class="news_about">51WORLD’s Cloud Mirror System Helps Implement the Digital Twin Airport</div>
<span class="index-content">At night, the grand and brightly-lit digital twin airport is hustling and bustling with planes and ground vehicles. On each route, the wing status of the aircraft, whether the landing gear is opened, the plane’s speed, altitude, latitude, and longitude are synchronized in real-time, presenting a lively picture of the whole airspace.▲Cloud mirror system interface demoSounds like an aviation simulation game? It is materialized in the cloud mirror system developed by 51WORLD and China Academy of Civil Aviation Science and Technology. Unlike the game, the digital twin airport has access to the real-time data of aviation, terminals, and ground operations, achieving “what you see is what you get”, which helps to improve operational efficiency and reduce management costs to a great extent.Covid-19 boosts intelligent airport constructionThe sudden outbreak of the new coronavirus has made the global civil aviation industry suffer from a cold winter that has not been seen in decades.The Airports Council International said in a report that the pandemic would reduce global passengers by two-fifths in 2020, while the airport’s revenue would be slashed by approximately 50 percent and the total loss would exceed $76 billion. Global carriers are also expected to undergo a 44 percent year-on-year decline in passenger revenue this year.Therefore, it is imperative to use digital twin, big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and other technological means to elevate the efficiency of the operation and management of the shipping hub. Meanwhile, as a crucial component of traditional infrastructure, the airport plays a significant role in safeguarding the livelihood of the community and guaranteeing economic development.▲Aircraft take-off and land in real-timeIn January, the Civil Aviation Administration issued an action plan for China’s airport construction, in which it put forward to build safe, green, intelligent, and humane airports by 2035 by means of intelligent measures. 2020 marks the beginning of the construction and the Civil Aviation Administration has established 23 demonstration projects of smart airport construction in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Despite strong support from the civil aviation authorities, technically, it is not easy to upgrade the traditional airports to the digital twin level.First of all, it is extremely difficult to integrate diverse systems since an air transport hub needs a variety of complex systems such as scene surveillance radar, airport panoramic monitoring, airport collaborative decision-making (A-CDM), delay information release, air traffic control coordination, meteorological observation and intelligent building management system (IBMS), to get the goings of an aircraft, the airspace, the situation on the ground as well as passengers flow of the public transport.Secondly, the lack of linkage between multiple departments such as the airport operations center (AOC), the terminal operations center (TOC), the ground transportation center (GTC), local municipal departments (rail transportation, health and epidemic prevention departments) and public security system, often result in data isolations.Finally, the chronic issues of inadequate data space attributes, fragmented scenes, and unintuitive interactive interfaces existing in the traditional airport management system itself are also the hurdles to overcome in the new airport construction.To build digital twin airports with a unified scale, caliber and interfaceTo cope with these problems mentioned above, 51WORLD and the China Academy of Civil Aviation Science and Technology jointly created a digital twin airport system- the cloud mirror system. At present, the system has been landed at some airport in the north. Compared with the traditional flat data center, the “cloud mirror” can map and feedback the aircraft’s take-offs and landings, cruise status as well as apron safety monitoring in space coordinates, attribute real geographic space coordinates to vehicles and aircraft, open up data isolations, and improve the effect and efficiency of information management.The standards boiled down to “three unifications”-namely, unified scale, unified caliber, and unified interface.The unified scale attributed a uniform, an identical coordinate system to the airport’s objects, data and information flow to clarify the location and status of objects such as aircraft, ground vehicles, IoT terminals, passengers, and staff.After integrating the spatial data of BIM, 3DMAX, CAD and GIS, 51WORLD and the team of China Academy of Civil Aviation Science and Technology mapped and connected the real geographic information coordinate system, quickly generate the airspace and city floor of hundreds of square kilometers of L2-L3, terminal buildings and apron road lines of L3 with 51Urbandata, thus constructing a digital twin base and laying a foundation for further comprehensive management.The unified caliber enabled the system to access multi-format, multi-form and multi-connotation data such as the surveillance radar, apron panoramic monitoring system, airport collaborative decision-making system (A-CDM), delay information release system, air traffic control coordination system, meteorological observation system, intelligent building management system (IBMS), IOT system, video surveillance, perimeter security system, etc., to achieve joint control of airport management.Both teams preset management objects such as aircraft and ground vehicles that could be driven by real-world operating data with independent semantics, which could be managed individually or jointly to form the object of a dynamic digital twin.For example, the operators could learn, in real-time, the current or past working status of the digital twins of ground-based operating vehicles such as bird-repellent vehicles, ferries, tractors, snow-sweepers, weeding vehicles, etc. with the data of their positions, speeds, and turning angles. In the event of an incident, the operator could check it back immediately.▲Ground vehicles managementThe unified interface empowered the system to manage the airport with one single screen by means of information integration, SOA, and SSO. At the same time, it was capable of allocating corresponding operating and data permissions for different personnel, posts and users according to the regulations, to ensure that the rules were strictly implemented and the personnel coordinated freely. When the scenes of the aprons and terminals ere highly accurate, services such as pedestrian thermals, vehicle dynamics, V2X simulation, driverless training, and traffic flow simulation could be introduced to preview the emergency management and airport construction scheme in the digital twin airport interface, providing the managers with an intuitive decision-making basis. It was worth noting that, via 51WORLD cloud rendering technology, workers could get the same operating experience and visual effects in the mobile applications as in the mainframe, and reversely control airport equipment to ensure high utilization of the system.Digital Twin Airports: addressing the issues of the present and being future-orientedThe digital twin airport greatly enhanced the efficiency of data analysis and business management, and provided intuitive and visual solutions to various kinds of problems in airport management, enabling airport managers to enjoy the technical dividends of digital twins. In terms of aviation, the system focused on the management of airspace radar, flight schedules, real-time flight monitoring and reviewing, runway take-off and landing occupation, airspace safety, UFO intrusion, weather, visibility, and control information.Aircraft posturesIn measuring how busy a route was, the system could generate a thermodynamic chart of each route by analyzing the time occupancy ratios, and present the monitoring results via the voxel grid after superimposing all the charts of the routes. In traditional large-screen mode, the results were often carried on multiple interfaces and presented in three views respectively, which could be converted into readable information only after the interpretation and recognition of a professional.On the contrary, in the cloud mirror system, an operator could easily arrange the flights and the routes within one interface. In terms of ground operations, as 51WORLD incorporated the surveillance video into the digital twin, combining the various sensors deployed in the airport perimeter, the system was able to issue warnings on unusual behaviors such as intrusion, unauthorized operation, speeding, and overtime working, thus safeguarding the operations on the ground.The interface of ground vehicles managementAs the accuracy of the digital twin airport improves in the future, the system can also calculate the blind areas and visual fields of monitoring, analyze the distribution of security, and help the managers to draw up proactive security strategy. In terms of the terminals, functions such as public transportation, building management, and visitor services could be loaded to connect with digital twin park solutions. At the same time, in line with national new infrastructure construction and to build a safe, green, intelligent and humane airport, the cloud mirror system also added in V2X communication, laser/mm-wave/ vision, vehicle dynamics, unmanned training set, advanced process simulation (APS) connecting capabilities. In the near future, the digital twins of unmanned shuttle buses and unmanned logistics vehicles can be realized on the same platform, which is convenient for the airport to expand related services.ConclusionAs the transportation hub of a city, an airport is a gateway and window for the city to demonstrate its achievements in smart construction, and a safe, green, intelligent, and humane airport speaks volumes for the city.The intelligent infrastructure and the traditional infrastructure are both indispensable for constructing a safe, green, intelligent, and humane airport while the digital twin technology is the bridge between the two, according to Zhang Kunqi, the manager of 51WORLD Pre-Sales Program and Ecological Partnership Department participating in the project.The business capabilities and technical strengths of the China Academy of Civil Aviation Science and Technology and 51WORLD were highly valued by each other. The success of this project couldn’t be separated from the professional advice and decades’ accumulation of the Academy in civil aviation safety, operation and development while 51WORLD delivered leading digital twin products and services.In the future, 51WORLD and the Academy will continue to work together in constructing safe, green, intelligent, and humane airports to help the long-term and healthy development of China’s civil aviation industry.</span>

<div class="news_about">How to Update Smart City Operating Platform from GIS to Digital Twins, We First Need to Answer a Philosophical Question|51SHARE</div>
<span class="index-content">The editor’s note:He studied in China’s best GIS major and turned down a postgraduate recommendation from his university. He rode 6,000 kilometers to see the great landscape of China. He maintained that the dimensions of the application of geographic information data should be elevated and a unified structured semantics is a key to earth cloning. He is Yang Jianshun, a system architect of the all-element scenarios team at the 51WORLD Earth Cloning Institute. Today we invite him to talk about GIS, digital twins, and Earth cloning.The essence of the world can be regarded as a monophysical entity organized by a unified all-element semantics.Part.1 Stepping out of the geographic information systemWhat is the essence of the world?This philosophical question is a probing and pragmatic question for 51WORLD’s system architects.When I applied for the GIS major at Wuhan University, my idea was simple — I liked geography and wanted to travel all over China like Xu Xiake, a renowned geographer in the 1600s. It was also at Wuhan University that I came up with the idea of digitally depicting the earth we are living in.Yang Jianshun51WORLD coins the idea as Earth Cloning, in which geographic information data is still one of the underlying foundations, only with the dimension of the applications being raised.After graduation, I was recommended to Beijing Normal University for a postgraduate degree. But as time went on, I found myself not interested in academics. Therefore, I dropped out of school and was eager to put what I have conceived into practice.Since then, I have accumulated ten years of 3D GIS-related working experience in technology, products, and markets.Looking back, the development of China’s geographic information industry is relatively smooth in general. Over the past five years, 3D GIS players and platforms, as well as the corresponding government and market needs, are emerging in this fledgling industry.Inevitably, technical inertia and stereotypes appeared. Traditional geographic information industry attached great importance to data, but without adequate data value mining; data analysis was paid enough attention but short of an effective expression of the results.There was a gulf existing between the status quo and the ever-changing needs of Party A. In traditional 3D GIS R&amp;D, the engineers chose to self-develop a set of engine platforms, on which the geographic information was presented. Some of these engines were revamped on the basis of open-source engines (such as WorldWind, OsgEarth, CesiumJS, etc.) while others were developed from scratch.As far as I know, there are hundreds of digital earth platforms developed in China alone. This was also what I’ve been doing for a long time: processing geographic information data efficiently under limited hardware and software conditions, and presenting it as best as possible.But in terms of the larger industry, everyone has made much the same thing, with no substantial let alone game-changing breakthroughs. There were no fundamental differences from the platforms of a decade ago other than the optimization of performance and efficiency.In recent years, Internet giants such as HBAT(Huawei, Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent), as well as digital twin startups such as 51WORLD, have tended to assimilate real-time GIS data from the Internet and the Internet of Things, which approach may not be that precise, but makes GIS data alive. The concept of upgrading basic data such as geographic information before applying is also gradually impacting the industry.After joining 51WORLD, I discussed with Wu Yaguang, the dean of the Earth Cloning Institute, for many a time. He is an expert in computer graphics and I have been working on 3D GIS for many years. Our cross-sector exchanges inspired each of us on data organization, graphics rendering, and interactive applications, especially on the technology path of how to clone the earth.Everyone makes different decisions at different times. Looking back, further study might be helpful for my future life, but I don’t regret giving it up since I enjoy and excel at what I am doing.Part.2 Exploring deeply in the Smart CityA smart city is a market with massive potentials. Traditional GIS enterprises have built up a plentiful understanding of the business and data in addressing the customers’ pain points. They still take the lead as the first movers in the industry after the 3D GIS was introduced. We should admit that we are standing on the shoulders of giants.51WORLD enters the market with its eyes on computer graphics and computer vision. It has delivered a large number of digital twin products of buildings and industrial parks and tried out in city-level applications. But in general, 51WORLD is still a new player and has a long way to go.51WORLD Earth Cloning 3 (EC3)For now, we are not yet able to process and analyze large-scale geographic information independently. However, as a technological startup, 51WORLD’s digital twin products have the advantage of short production cycles, fast iterations, consistent quality and great scalability. Archer Li, the company’s CEO and founder says 51WORLD has three “not to does “.First, instead of collecting data sources, we focus on data fusion.Second, instead of delivering general integration services, we sharpen our competitiveness in the core products of the all-element scenarios.Third, instead of venturing into vertical industry applications alone, we are glad to co-develop with our ecological partners. These guidelines determine 51WORLD’s business models and market strategies.As far as I know, some companies in the industry, especially many start-ups, go out of their ways to get a project and in the end, have to outsource the software and adopt project-based management.This labor-consuming approach is actually detrimental to the growth of a company. Issues such as lengthening project cycle and slow repayment resulted from demand changes and chaotic management, may bring down a company. However, in the domestic market, whether you can directly solve the problem for Party A is a matter of life and death.So someone has to do the basic work. In this process, we mesh with industry partners and general integrators to provide them with standardized digital twin services. The cake of the smart cities is huge and the enterprises need to know their boundaries.But as one of the R&amp;D personnel, I know, apart from sharpening our competitiveness, we should also strengthen our weak points, among which are the processing of multiple data sources and business-oriented data analysis.Part.3 Digital twins: real data applications of elevated dimensionAs the company expands, the direction of our R&amp;D gets more diversified and the Earth Cloning Institute feels the pressure. For example, the burgeoning demands for oblique photography, BIM, and CAD data processing at this stage are actually what the R&amp;D is calling for after receiving the feedback from the market.The more diversified the market needs, the more we need to focus. The technological team should have its own independent thinking in choosing the research direction, to lead the development of the industry, to explore the frontline standards, and to develop more innovative and game-changing products.This is the only way to clone the earth. But no matter which specific R &amp; D field we are aiming for, we are looking for a way to create digital twin earth, to clone the planet we are living. This colossal project starts with data collection, in which the data of different dimensions are exhaustively gathered in various ways, to replicate the real world.This is also what many industries including geographic information are doing, from vectors and rasters in traditional GIS to oblique photography and laser point clouds, as well as BIM in the construction industry and high-precision maps for autonomous driving in transportation, etc.But the method of creating business applications directly in this “replicated world” is not necessarily viable since the lack of a unified structured semantics will affect the final effect.So what is a unified structured semantics? We believe that the earth is made of elements. Whether it is a vector, raster, grid, or point cloud, it is a form of expression of the elements. All elements need a unified structured semantics to describe and interpret. For example, we can understand the buildings through the semantics of the contour, height, color, material, and building structure, etc.Without a structured semantics, all we see is triangle grids or point clouds connected together. All industries need to extract their “customized” data standards and specifications. Therefore, we regard the nature of the world as a monophysical entity organized by a unified all-element semantics.Future data format shall not only conform to the standards of the data producers or one individual industry but also take into account more knowledge including multi-industry data production, multi-engine platforms, and multi-industry applications. Therefore, these “definitions” need to meet a higher level of standards, thereby ensuring the independence of standards in various fields while achieving an inter-industry data connection.51WORLD Digital Twin ShanghaiIt is based on this concept that 51WORLD presents the region’s all-element scenarios(AES), including the scenes of cities, roads, buildings, and vegetation from the real world, featuring in virtual reality, geographic information reality, physical simulation reality, and real-time free interactivity. It is also with AES that we create a digital twin of the real world.In the future, we will phrase in some processing standards for AES semantics to promote the industry. 51WORLD stays committed to cloning the earth and the aspiration of creating a realistic, complete, and lasting digital twin world remains firm. And that’s what I’ve been dreaming of for years as a GIS student.</span>

<div class="news_about">The Roundup of How to Create a Massive Simulation Environment for Intelligent Transportation? |51TECH</div>
<span class="index-content">51TECH is 51WORLD’s brand-new column, delivering the frontline analysis of cutting-edge and hard-core technologies.We believe that technology transforms our life, we believe in the goodness of technology, and we hope to share our experience and thinking with the industry at 51TECHIn recent years, the concept of “big world” put forward in the field of smart transportation has posed new challenges for related simulation. Among them, the four major challenges for the static simulation of intelligent traffic are the construction of super-large maps of hundreds of square kilometers at the macro level, the integration of digital assets in the “big world” at the meso-level, the optimization of rendering efficiency on multiple platforms, and the construction of a composite digital asset library at the micro-level.In this issue of 51TECH, we invite Wang Chao, the content director of 51WORLD Intelligent Driving and Transportation Division, to talk about the upgrade of static environment simulation technologies and the detailed explanation of creating a large traffic simulation environment.The content team of 51WORLD Intelligent Driving and Transportation Division has been committed to providing full-stack content solutions for autonomous driving simulation and traffic simulation since its inception. It has accumulated rich experience in the rapid production of simulated maps, automated map generation, efficient rendering on multiple platforms, and aesthetic balance after delivering nearly 100 projects.As a seasoned frontline static simulation engineer, Wang feels the challenges facing the current industry.Part.1 Constructing and balancing the “big virtual world”As the advent of the 5G era has pushed intelligent transportation to a new height, the concept of “big world” came into being in the field of traffic simulation. The big world denotes the upsurge of demand in the range of simulated visual maps and the length of road network. A transportation project may require hundreds or even thousands of kilometers of large or super large simulation maps for training, collecting vehicle data set, and assisting in decision-making. It also means an exponential increase in the volume of simulation functions.Four major challenges come on the heels of this burgeoning industry: the construction of super-large maps of hundreds of square kilometers, the integration of digital assets in the “big world”, the optimization of rendering efficiency on multiple platforms, and the construction of a composite digital asset library.01 Construction of super-large road networksA bird’s eye view of the West Third Ring Project in BeijingSince the localized simulation maps of the first perspective are limited and inadequate for smart transportation, the free-view maps with the car-tracking perspective and the bird’s-eye view are constantly yearned for. However, it needs an accurate restoration of hundreds of kilometers or even thousands of kilometers of the simulated terrain to realize a bird’s-eye view from the third perspective. For example: to simulate a 100- square-kilometer scene, it is necessary to recreate roads with a total length of 300 kilometers, of which about 40 kilometers are highways or first-level roads, about 160 kilometers are urban expressways or second-level roads and 100 kilometers of branch roads or roads of the third level and below, thus forming a huge road network.A diagram of the simulated road networkTherefore, we need to efficiently integrate and utilize limited computing resources, so as to complete such large-scale simulation maps. Next, I will explain how we significantly reduce the unreasonable resource consumption of the GPU with stress tests.How to do stress testing?It must be clarified that since a traffic simulation map is the mapping and restoration of the real world, it depends on various data sources, including point cloud data, tilt photography, satellite images, panoramic images, aerial video, etc. However, these real data are more or less problematic, so a secondary design is needed to achieve accurate geographic location, matching regional style, and smooth operation efficiency.We conduct research with our accumulated blank model testing data to evaluate the integration of the road network and the surface, and calculate a set of map segmentation schemes to facilitate the program to efficiently load each atomic map, thereby enabling transportation functions to make more flexible. In addition, we subdivide the smooth meshes to no less than 3 times, simulate no less than 100 dynamic vehicles and no less than 100 moving pedestrians, and adapt complex coloring and high-precision textures to the components of the blank model for specific tests. At the same time, we add greenery of no less than 5000 types to verify the frame rate of static scenes. 。We group the testing according to the types of rendering, such as road networks, buildings, vegetation, etc., and strictly control the budget after stress testing, in order to improve the team’s efficiency, thereby shortening the development cycle. It is worth noting that even without ForceCulling, LOD, and HLOD, the current stress test method we use is generally very efficient, because this method can quickly assess the impact of the asset on the map rendering and quickly calculate the budget for various types of resources such as buildings, roads, surfaces, vehicles, and pedestrians, so as to reserve more space for dynamic functions.When the stress testing is done abundantly, we can optimize the product for different situations. Next, I will talk about the difficulties in restoring the road network. The road network should reveal the complexity of the real road, such as the undulating conditions of the road surface, the changes of the intersections, etc. Meanwhile, it should be able to meet different needs of smart transportation such as parallel computing, sensor simulation, vehicle dynamics, etc. Therefore, the production of a traffic simulation road network cannot be done simply with the curve editing tool of Spline.51WORLD independently developed the WorldEditor to automate the geometric data and UV mapping of a road network, thus greatly improving the efficiency of producing a road network, on which a whole simulated world can be developed.OpenDrive road network file exported by WorldEditorAt present, our team is capable of producing large maps of 100 square kilometers, and we aspire to rapidly recreate larger maps of several square kilometers and construct the road network of thousands of kilometers. Next, I will talk about how to effectively integrate digital assets in producing maps.02 Integrating digital assets in the “Big World”An integrated display of various digital assets in stress testing mapsThe Big World is a combination of small cell maps, each containing a huge number of digital assets. Different projects have different acceptance criteria. Now, we integrate digital assets mainly in two directions: one is to add semantics, and the other is to lighten heavy assets.Adding semantics to digital assets: assets used in sensor simulation are typical heavyweight digital assets and of the highest level. As time and weather vary, semantic information should be added to meet different requirements of sensor recognition training, such as the parameter of wet and dry environment changes, snow stains coverage parameters, etc. Up till now, we have processed more than 40 semantic heavyweight digital asset types, which maximizes the restoration of object properties and material changes in the real world.The lightening of heavy assets is often used for the rapid retrieval and use of assets. For example, the digital assets loaded in the WorldEditor need to be lightweight. At the appearance, it seems feasible to make multiple versions of assets to meet different needs. However, the extremely high costs put off even the most fervent tech-lovers.Therefore, we define varied requirements in different levels of LOD, encapsulate these assets with BP, upgrade and downgrade them more flexibly, adapt appendages, and replace materials to support sensor simulation, case testing, and vehicle dynamics.For example, we divide the attributes of real-world vehicles into static and dynamic. In the static dimension, lightweight assets need a reasonable structure, a low number of faces, and a small number of materials, while heavyweight assets need to be clearly structured with rich materials and realistic textures. Meanwhile, both of them can flexibly add appendages, such as bus license plates, advertising stickers, warning lamps, etc. In the dynamic dimension, the first consideration should be given to adapt corresponding skeleton animations to different levels, restrict the luminous intensity, and control the number of particles, etc. Therefore, flexible upgrades, downgrades as well as adaption become the kernel of making composite assets.03 Establishing a composite digital asset libraryA digital asset library is the smallest unit to build a map. Whether a single asset meets the rendering standards in the field of traffic products directly affects the performance of a simulated map, which determines the feasibility of constructing a big world. Therefore, it is instrumental to build a composite digital asset library. We assess digital assets in terms of aesthetics, compliance, and feasibility.Aesthetics: we should evaluate whether a digital asset faithfully restores the properties of objects in the real world, such as surface materials, size ratio, etc. and whether a digital asset meets the public aesthetic standards. For example, we construct pedestrian characters with 3D footage from live scanning and create behavioral actions from action sequences generated by Motion Capture, to make them more credible and beautiful.Compliance: The compliance of a digital asset will have a direct impact on the cost of its subsequent iteration. The assessment of compliance not only includes models and materials but also hidden functions such as vertex shading, the role of multiple sets of UV, model LOD, physical materials collision occludes, luminous parts, multi-dimensional sub-materials, bones, audio code rate, animation frame rate, particle size range, source file format, naming rules, storage location, etc.Feasibility: When a digital asset is referenced by a map, first it must be flexibly used by the level designer. And the second modification will not lead to repeated revision and construction of the level. Last, it can be modularly combined into a new resource. The gist lies in whether an asset has been dismantled carefully in the early stages of production.A diagram of the composition of digital assets.In static environment simulation for intelligent transportation and autonomous driving, the closest visual distance of a digital asset should be less than 1m, which is highly dependent on the digital asset library. The asset should be able to be displayed on multiple platforms, such as PC-based VR, MR and XR, and the access of cloud rendering also needs to consider the size of the resource package. It emphasizes the functions and effects, but the digital asset needs to be lightened, the seemingly contradictory requirement of which also exists in the film and game industry.9 categories of digital assets.Our digital asset library consists of nine categories that assume the largest elements of the real world. Each category is divided into no less than 8 sub-levels. In principle, any static digital asset should be dynamically scalable. Therefore, we’ve reserved the functional interfaces, such as LOD, UV, materials, and vertex information for a static 3D model, so that engineers can freely combine the tools into dynamic elements available, which are, of course, part of the asset library.The proportion of working hours after cleaning the original non-standard digital assets of the vehicle to meet different functionsSince simulating each 3D asset in the virtual environment takes a large amount of time, it is unattainable to process every digital asset to be extremely aesthetical. If we grade the digital assets of film and games at 10, these required by the digital twin can only get 6. It also seems realistic to remove redundant artistic details and return the models, textures, and materials to the original state.The composite digital assets commonly used for transportation projectsAlthough we don’t agree with each other in aesthetics, I believe that digital twins must meet the basic standards, such as the blue sky on a sunny day, reflections on the surface of the water, etc. How to strike a balance between intuition and emotion is the basis for defining digital assets, which is also bound up with costs.04 Rendering efficiency on multiple platformsDue to the secondary design of the maps, performance stress testing, and the maintenance of standardized composite digital assets, the rendering efficiency of transportation simulation projects we delivered in multiple platforms is generally up to standards, even outperforming peer products. At present, intelligent transportation and autonomous driving simulation projects are mostly based on the PC platform. Against this backdrop, how to realize efficient rendering on other platforms such as 5G cloud rendering streaming, VR and MR poses another challenge for the industry.In addition to the scale of the map, the digital asset itself and the toolchain also affect rendering efficiency. Just like running, being able to run is one thing, but to run fast is another. It is not easy to run with data and functions. Of digital assets, different perspectives, models, textures, materials, lights, motion sequences, special effects, sound effects, UI, etc. also have an impact on rendering efficiency.The path design of the dynamic camera in the large traffic simulation map.How to improve the rendering efficiency of the simulated maps? It is ideal to work with lightened maps on high-performance PCs.Currently, we have achieved the following goals in traffic projects based on PC hardware:[Successful implementation cases]Up to now, our team has guaranteed the frame rate in the L4 static simulation maps of hundreds of square kilometers (51WORLD all-element scenes are divided into five levels from L1 to L5, with the scenes of L4-L5 being able to restore detailed elements such as roads, traffic facilities, vehicles, and pedestrians), and it has been verified on recent large projects.L1-L5 all-element scenes of the static simulationA microsimulation of rapid roadA micro-simulation of a blockA meso-simulation of smart trafficA macro-simulation of a transportation hubIn making the micro-simulation map of the traffic in Beijing’s West Third Ring, we covered a total mileage of 30 kilometers from Wanliu Bridge to Suzhou Bridge and 10 kilometers of branch roads, restoring a whole area of 400 square kilometers.Thanks to the building capability of large scenes, we have adopted the WorldMap, a construction approach particularly helpful for building linear road maps, which enables us freely load and cull target levels while changing multiple camera positions, making it easier to balance the performances between multiple sub-maps.The steps of producing the linear road network of Beijing’s West Third RingPart.2 Seeking truth in detail and infinitely approaching the realTransportation simulation aims for being realistic. If we personify a product, saying it has bones and flesh after solving the four major challenges above, the game doesn’t stop here. We want to make it more lifelike by perfecting the product in terms of macro geographic information, micro scenes management and dynamic systems.A corner of the traffic case map01 Restoring real geographic informationFrom the macroscopic dimension, the rules of constructing in the real-world should be applied in a virtual simulation, to ensure the authenticity of the simulated environment to the greatest extent.The order of simulation is similar to that of the actual construction. First of all, in terms of geographical information, we should consider the earth’s latitude, longitude, time and weather, and reserve the real natural environment of mountains, rivers and lakes. Then, a piece of land is allocated to plan the road network, followed by the generation of different types of buildings. Finally, we scrutinize the details of the network, such as the road-related facilities and greening off the roads.The 1:1 restoration of the Jiading demonstration area of the National Intelligent Network02 Subdivided scene categoriesWe divide static simulation into more than 20 categories from the microscopic dimension, each with different priorities. Here are some major categories: geographical type, road type, road marking, traffic-related equipment, roadside facilities, main vehicles and traffic flow, pedestrians and animals, weather and time, and display perspectives. 51WORLD has subdivided toolchains for each category and we will consider the real situation of different projects. Taking the geographical type as an example: as Guangzhou is closer to the equator than Beijing, their green plants, surface textures, and light and shadow changes vary significantly.The details of the static simulation of traffic-related facilities such as traffic lights, signs, radar speed measurement, etc. are easily overlooked, but 51WORLD has been constantly enriching and accumulating different styles. Apart from following the national standards, we underline the features in various regions. For example, the traffic lights in Beijing is of standard cylindrical shape, the lights in Shanghai have curved angles while these in Shenzhen have eaves like wearing a beret.Categories divided according to the applied scenarios03 A complete dynamic systemStatic environment simulation needs a dynamic system to be faithful and realistic. We compare the dynamic systems of traffic flow, pedestrian flow, weather, and time changes as the neural networks in intelligent traffic simulation. Time and weather systems have the highest adhesion to static environment simulation.People who has had offline rendering experience know that even if the world is made of white boxes, GI and lighting can make it real, good-looking and credible. Therefore, this technique can be capitalized on in real-time rendering. Light and shadow directly affect people’s perception. Continued improvement of light tracing technology will inevitably push environmental simulation to a higher level.Perfect time and weather functions enable the R &amp; D team to define traffic cases more accurately. Traditional real-time rendering engine fails to fully support the access and connection of real data, although in which dynamic weather and time are gradually improved. For example, if the customer asks for some rainfall in a sunny environment at 12, or vaguely seeing the outline of the sun in a cloudy evening, in the past, we have to produce the time and weather separately. However, as the demands surge, the lack of relevant tools will seriously reduce work efficiency and output quality. Besides, it will be very unfriendly to the semantic recognition of the sensors.Therefore, our content team designed a time and weather system based on current project types, in which we set 8 common kinds of weather and 12 extreme conditions, reserved the interfaces of time, material, special effects, and animation. The secondary development of these functions will enable flexible utilization of 51Sim-One, and meet the customers’ highly customized needs for time and weather to the greatest extent. Now the senior programmers on the engineering team are working hard to upgrade this tool to make it handier in the future.The 24-hour changing effect of the time system in the smart transportation projectTime and weather system effectsAt present, our team can freely switch from process to quality control in static simulation, make realistic virtual scenes, and deliver the product in time. We believe that in the future, with the continuous iteration of lighting, materials, animation and other technologies in real-time rendering, the simulated maps, and dynamic effects will be presented as more real. In this regard, we organize regular training courses to keep the members in touch with the latest trends in the industry and aspire to sharpen our competitive edge.</span>
