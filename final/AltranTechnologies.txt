internal third parties as set out in the glossary
external third parties as set out in the glossary
third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. if a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy
we require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. we do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
we are a global enterprise with operations in countries around the world.
capgemini engineering na has implemented global privacy practices for processing personal data protected under various data protection laws. capgemini engineering na transfers personal data between the countries in which we operate in accordance with the standards and conditions of applicable data privacy laws, including standards and conditions related to security and processing.
if you reside outside of the european economic area (eea) or switzerland, by providing your personal data, you consent to the sharing of your personal data as described above and any resulting cross-border transfers.
transferring data between internal third parties or to external third parties may involve transferring your data outside the eea or switzerland.
whenever we transfer your personal data out of the eea, whether to capgemini engineering group companies or to external third parties, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the european commission. for further details, see european commission: adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-eu countries; or
where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the european commission that give personal data the same protection it has in europe. for further details, european commission: model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the eea.
we have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered, or disclosed. in addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties who have a business need to know. they will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
we have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
collection of information by third party sites
like many other commercial websites, our site contains links to other sites whose information collection practices may be different than ours. users should consult the other sites’ privacy policies, as we do not have any control over any information that may be submitted to, or collected by, such third parties.
although we employ security measures to prevent unauthorized access to information we collect online, we cannot guarantee the privacy of personal data you transmit over the web, or that may be collected in transit by third parties, including any consultants that provide services to us.
we will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
to determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
under certain circumstances, and depending on your location you have rights under applicable data protection laws in relation to your personal data. the following descriptions provides you with more information about these rights if you are a european union citizen which capgemini engineering na will respect regardless of where you visit this website from:
request access to your personal data
this right enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing such personal data. in order to comply with your request, we may ask you to verify your identity.
request correction of your personal data
this right enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data that you provide to us.
request erasure of your personal data
this right enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue processing it or where applicable law requires erasure. please note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
object to processing of your personal data
if there is something about your particular circumstance that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it adversely affects your fundamental rights and freedoms please contact us. in some instances, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
request restriction of processing your personal data
this right enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy;
where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or
you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
request transfer of your personal data
we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. please note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
right to withdraw consent
you have the right to withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. however, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. we will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
if you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us
process for responding
you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). this is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. we may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
we try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. in this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
revisions to this privacy policy
we may periodically update this policy to comply with privacy regulations, describe new website features, products or services we offer, and how it may affect our use of information about you.
for california residents, please consult our california consumer privacy policy.
legitimate interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. we make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. we do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
internal third parties mean other companies in the capgemini engineering group acting as joint controllers or processors and who provide it and system administration services, undertake leadership reporting, and/or provide services as part of the processing of the personal data described in this privacy policy.
external third parties means:
service providers acting as processors who provide it and system administration services;
professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors, and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance, and accounting services;
regulators(including data protection supervisory authorities) and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based in the united kingdom and/or eea who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances;
