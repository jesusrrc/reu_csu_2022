welcome, and thank you for choosing prodsmart
this privacy statement explains how prodsmart processes personal data collected through websites, products, and services (“applications”) and through in-person and digital events, webinars, surveys, marketing activities, and visits to our premises (along with applications, collectively our “offerings”). references to “prodsmart,” “we,” or “our” means prodsmart, inc. and other entities that belong to the prodsmart corporate family and that link to this privacy statement.
we may display supplemental privacy notices on occasion, such as when we believe additional transparency would help you make an informed choice about whether to provide personal data. for example, you may see a supplemental privacy notice explaining a particular data collection program, or you may see a supplemental privacy notice when registering for an event.
this privacy statement describes how we process personal data for our own purposes. we also process personal data on behalf of our customers subject to a written contract. we do not control the data processing or protection practices of our customers, which may differ from those set out in this privacy statement.
“personal data” is information that identifies, or can reasonably be linked directly or indirectly to, an identifiable person. personal data does not include information that is anonymous, de-identified, or aggregated, as those terms may be defined under applicable law. for purposes of this privacy statement, “personal data” and “personal information” have the same meaning and are used interchangeably.

we obtain personal data in different ways. some personal data is collected directly from you. other data is automatically collected or generated about how, when, and why you interact with us through our offerings, including data obtained through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies. we also obtain data about you from third parties.

what are prodsmart’s storage and data retention practices?
we store your personal data and content on our servers and the servers of our service providers. because we and our service providers maintain servers in global locations, your personal data may be transferred across national borders and stored on the servers outside of your country or region. we will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to provide you with the offerings that you are using or have requested, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and as needed to comply with our legal obligations. data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.
does prodsmart transfer your personal data across national borders?
because we are a global company, we transfer personal data across national borders to other countries, in compliance with the laws that apply to that data.
what are prodsmart’s marketing and advertising practices?
we may use analytics tools and also work with one or more advertising networks (our “ad partners”) that use cookies or other technologies to collect information about application visitors, to serve ads, and to help us track results of advertising and marketing campaigns. through these means, we and/or our ad partners may be able to collect information from application visitors, including websites visited, how and when applications are used, marketing preferences, ip addresses, device ids, and browser information. this information is used to display personalized advertising in websites and other applications, to calculate and control the number of unique and repeat views of a given ad, to deliver ads that relate to a visitor’s interests, and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. we process your personal data for the above activities in furtherance of our legitimate interests or, where required, with your consent.
you can opt out of the use of your information by ad partners for online behavioral advertising by using the digital advertising alliance’s your adchoices tool. the your adchoices tool may not work if your browser does not accept third-party cookies, and if you delete cookies, use a different browser, or use a different computer, you will need to use the tool again to renew your opt out.
as described above, you can change your cookie preferences. cookie choices are generally application-, browser-, and device-specific, so you may need to refresh your choices if you visit a different application, use a new browser or device, or clear your browser’s cookies.
prodsmart currently does not respond to “do not track” signals.
is the personal data you give us ever displayed publicly?

in some cases, you can limit who can view or access the information and content you post. in other cases, the information and content might be available to registered members of the offering, or even to the general public. your name, username, profile image, or email address (particularly if this is your username) may be posted along with any message or other content you post through some of our offerings.
if you are posting information you do not want to be disclosed publicly, make sure you are using an offering that allows you to control who sees information you have posted.
