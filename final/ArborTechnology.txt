the following policy we hope will answer any questions you might have concerning the way customer information is collected, controlled and safeguarded. arbor follows all applicable laws on data privacy protection and data security. the ultimate goal for gathering information is to improve service and support to customers.
what personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website?
arbor will not collect any personal data about you (e.g. your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address), unless you voluntarily choose to provide us with it (e.g. by registration, surveys, etc.). arbor is the sole owner of the information collected on our web sites. under no circumstances will we share your customer information with anyone other than those directly involved with the purchase and shipment of your order, unless you explicitly give us permission to do so. we may use your e-mail address to notify you of special offers and promotions that you are eligible to participate in as a registered customer. you may decline this service.

performance cookies:we utilise other cookies to analyze how our visitors use our  websites and to monitor website performance. this allows us to provide a high  quality experience by customising our offering and quickly identifying and  fixing any issues that arise. for example, we might use performance cookies to  keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between  pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error  messages. we might also use these cookies to highlight articles or site  services that we think will be of interest to you based on your usage of the  website.
