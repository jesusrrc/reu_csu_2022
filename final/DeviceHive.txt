about cookies and their usage
our web site uses third party “cookies”. a cookie is a file containing a modest amount of data specific to                    a particular client and website (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web                    browser and is stored by the browser. the identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser                    requests a page from the server. this allows the server to deliver a page tailored to a particular user,                    or the page itself can contain some script which is aware of the data in the cookie and so is able to                    carry information from one visit to the website (or related site) to the next.
cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information                    that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
