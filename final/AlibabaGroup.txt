cookies
web pages on this website may contain cookies or related technology to facilitate your experience with this website. cookies are text files placed in your computer's internet browser to store your preferences. cookies do not provide your email address or other pii. we may also collect information on which web pages you visited, the links or advertisements you click on and other actions you take while on our website. alibaba only obtains this information when you choose to provide it to the website. however, once you choose to provide alibaba with your pii by entering it into this website, such data may be linked to data stored in the cookies. you may disable cookies in your browser.  however, certain functionalities of this website may not work if cookies are disabled.
disclosure
we will not sell, share, or rent your information to others except to our staff and to trusted third parties and affiliates when we need to share the information to provide a product or service you have requested.  we may also share your information to enable a trusted third party or affiliate to provide services to us, and then only to provide those services. we limit as commercially reasonable their access and use of your pii to that which is necessary to provide these services to us. without limiting the above, we will share your pii with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.
we may also be required by law to disclose your pii in response to a subpoena, court order, or a request for cooperation from law enforcement or other governmental agency globally. your pii may also be shared when we believe disclosure is necessary in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity or other wrongdoing, to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of alibaba, our users, or others. we will use commercially reasonable efforts to make you aware of the disclosure of your pii contrary to the terms set forth in this privacy policy (e.g., in the event of any material security breach).
third party links and policies
the website may contain links to other websites owned and operated by third parties and/or affiliates. these third parties and affiliates may collect information from you. these affiliates and third parties and their computer servers may be located in the people's republic of china, the united states, or in other countries. we do not control, and are not responsible for, the privacy and security practices of any third parties or affiliates. we strongly recommend that you review the privacy and security policies of all third parties and affiliates to determine how they handle information they may collect about you. to the extent their privacy policies conflict with this privacy policy, their privacy policies shall control.
do not track policy
the laws of some jurisdictions require that operators of website and online services disclose how they respond to a do not track signal and whether other third parties may collect pii about an individual's online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.
some browsers have incorporated "do not track" features. most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. because there is not yet a common, global understanding of how to interpret do not track signals, alibaba does not currently respond to do not track signals.
