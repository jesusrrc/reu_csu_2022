specific to data transfers outside the european union (“eu”), some non-european economic area (“eea”) countries are recognized by the european commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to eea standards (the full list of these countries is available here). for transfers from the eea to countries not considered adequate by the european commission, we will take reasonable steps, such as implementing the standard contractual clauses adopted by the european commission, to protect your personal information.

in addition, individuals in the eu and some other jurisdictions outside the united states have certain legal rights with regard to accessing personal information that you have provided to us. if you would like to request to review, correct, update, restrict, object, or delete personal information that you have previously provided to us, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your personal information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), you may contact us by email at privacy@jabil.com. the rights described here are subject to limitations and exceptions under applicable law. we will respond to and comply with your request(s) consistent with applicable law as soon as reasonably practicable.

viii. data retention

what are cookies?
a cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you visit a website. in this text file, the website stores information that it would like to be able to read the next time you visit the page. it is often information that is used for statistics and analysis and is completely harmless.

first-party cookies are set directly by the website the user is visiting, i.e the url displayed in the browser's address bar.
