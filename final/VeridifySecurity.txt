this privacy policy applies to the personally identifiable information or personal information (separately and together, personal information) collected by veridify security inc (veridify) off-line and on-line through the veridify website and through interactive features, applications, widgets, blogs, social networks, and on-line or wireless offerings that refer to this policy, whether accessed through a computer, mobile device, or other technology.
review this policy and the terms as applicable to your interaction with veridify. a third-party website linked to and/or from a veridify website or application or other means may have different policies; as a result of the foregoing, review the applicable privacy policy for that website. this policy does not cover the use of personal information directly obtained by a third party from you; use of such personal information is covered by the relevant party's privacy policy, not this privacy policy.
2. collection of information
a. information provided
in general. while veridify does not generally require the provision of personal information to visit and use a veridify website or to participate in certain veridify website and application activities, such as sweepstakes, contests and other promotions (collectively, promotions) and blogs, chat rooms, veridify may ask you to provide personal information through its website or its applications that could reasonably be used to contact you, provide the services contemplated by the website or application, or to identify you personally (such as first and last name, e-mail address, mailing address and telephone number). veridify may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (such as gender, geographic region, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests. if you choose not to provide such personal information or other information, you may not be able to participate in certain activities offered by veridify. if veridify combines demographic or other information veridify collects about you with your personal information, veridify intends to treat the combined information as personal information.
individuals under 13. a veridify website is open to all individuals, though some promotions may have age restrictions. veridify does not knowingly collect or permit the collection, storage or use of any personal information from anyone under 13. if you are a parent or guardian who knows or has discovered that your child under the age of 13 has submitted his or her personal information or other information without your consent, permission or authorization, veridify will promptly, upon request: (a) provide direct notice to you indicating what, if any, personal information of your child has been collected and how it has been used and/or disclosed; (b) remove your child's personal information or other information from the production database, cease the use of such information and direct any other party with access to such information to do the same; and (c) by notice to you, confirm compliance with the foregoing.
for promotions. veridify may offer opportunities to enter into promotions, on its own or jointly with or on behalf of a third party. such promotions may require registration and the disclosure of both personal information and non-personal information. in the event that a promotion is offered jointly or on behalf of with a third party, as a result of your participation in such promotion, your personal information and non-personal information may be shared with such third party, which sharing veridify will disclose to you at the time you provide your information. by entering a promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, which may contain specific requirements, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other third parties connected to the promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising and marketing materials. therefore, read the rules of the promotion before entering.
