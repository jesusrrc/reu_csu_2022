in addition to the foregoing, fac may collect other types of user information to allow fac to conduct market research, meet user needs and promote the purposes of the fac web site.  fac does not sell, rent, or trade personal information to third parties, although fac may share personal information with its parent, affiliates and business partners in order to facilitate user purchases, or to government agencies and courts when required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.
b. cookies
fac may use “cookies” to collect information concerning use of the fac web site by users. a “cookie” is a small file that the fac web site can place on a user’s computer hard drive in order, for example, to gather information concerning users’ use of the fac web site, to allow a more streamlined use of the fac web site, and improve the functionality of the fac web site. the cookie transmits this information back to the fac web site’s computer. the use of cookies is a relatively standard practice which is employed by most major corporate web sites. cookies cannot read any information from the user’s hard drive or read any information collected by other cookie files created by other web sites. users may determine when “cookies” are placed on their web sites, or prevent the placement of “cookies” on their web sites, by adjusting their browser features.  users may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate browser setting; however, this may result in the inability to use the full functionality of the web site. users wishing to do so should consult their it managers or conduct an internet search in order to obtain more information.

d. user options
users of this web site are subject to the fac’s terms and conditions of web site use. in the event fac collects any information from a user which such user wishes to retrieve, update, modify or have deleted, such user should contact fac as set forth in section i hereunder.
e. security of your personal information
given the fac web site’s purpose of providing information about fac and its products, fac uses reasonable efforts to safeguard information concerning, and submitted by, users. fac secures the personally identifiable information of users on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  when personal information is transmitted to other web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption.  however, fac cannot guarantee the security of its databases or that information supplied by user will not be intercepted while being transmitted.

h. updates
fac recognizes the need to update this privacy policy to reflect new features and services provided by fac and/or ensure compliance with applicable law. fac reserves the right to update this online privacy policy as it deems necessary.  if there are changes or additions to this online privacy policy, fac will post those changes here or in other formats for review.
