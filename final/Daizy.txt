finally, please note that some of the above mentioned personal data will be used for fraud detection and prevention, and for security purposes. the above mentioned personal data may also be used to comply with applicable laws, with investigations performed by the relevant authorities, law enforcement purposes, and/or to exercise or defend legal claims.
in certain cases, we may or will anonymize your personal data. “anonymous data” means information which does not enable identification of an individual user, such as aggregated information about the use of our services. we may use anonymous data and/or disclose it to third parties without restrictions (for example, in order to improve our services and enhance your experience with them).
your rights
under the eu general data protection regulation (gdpr), you have certain rights over your personal data. not all the rights listed below are engaged in all circumstances. on receipt of a rights request, we will assess whether the right you are seeking to exercise is engaged.
under gdpr, you have the right to:
access your personal data
you may request access to your personal information, which enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
update your personal data
you may request to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
erase your personal data
you may ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it or where you successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below). please note that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
object to the use of your personal data
you may object to the processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (of our own or of a third-party). you also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
restrict the use of your personal data
you may request that we suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios:
if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.
where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.
where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
transfer your personal data
you may request that we transfer your personal information to you or to a third party in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
withdraw consent
you may withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. however, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. furthermore, if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain, or any, products or services to you. we will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
how do you exercise your rights?
you may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by email to privacy@daizy.com, or written notice to the address provided above.
you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). this is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. we may also contact you to ask for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
accessing your personal information
if you wish to review or receive copies of the personal information we hold about you, change your marketing preferences, or have any other privacy queries, please write to us (including full details of your request) at the following email address: privacy@daizy.com
as noted above, any access request may be subject to a reasonable fee to meet our costs in providing you with details of the personal information we hold about you.
