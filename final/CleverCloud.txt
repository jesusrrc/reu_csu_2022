privacy policy
last updated on: 2022-05-05
respecting the confidentiality and integrity of our customers’ data is a priority for clever cloud. that is why we take care to limit our processing of personal data to what is necessary for the provision of our services, and to fully respect your rights guaranteed by the european regulation on the protection of personal data (“gdpr”) of april 27, 2016.
in general and except for the specific needs detailed below, clever cloud does not access the data you choose to host on the platform. in any case, clever cloud never exploits the data of your own customers and users. this privacy policy details what data we process, why we process it, and what rights you have. it applies to our own customers’ personal data collected during your use of the clever cloud platform, accessible on the clever-cloud.com domain. however, each clever cloud customer who uses our hosting services to run an application is solely responsible for the processing of his or her own users’ data, subject to the data processing agreement that is part of the contract between you and clever cloud.
1. the data processings by clever cloud
clever cloud processes personal data for various purposes, in particular:
statistical analysis of website visits
during your visit to the platform, including the site accessible at www.clever-cloud.com, clever cloud collects data necessary to detect anomalies, to track visits to the various pages and components of the platform, to verify the suitability of the content to the expectations of our visitors and users, and to optimize the performance of the website and the platform.
these data strictly necessary for the proper administration of the platform include:
the first half of your ip address (e.g. 192.168.xxx.xxx);
the version of your browser;
your operating system (e.g. windows, mac os, linux…);
the type of terminal (e.g. telephone, computer…) and its screen resolution;
the url of the pages you visit or the type of action you take;
a pseudonymous identifier.
they are kept and processed for 180 days within the matomo analytics tool hosted on its own servers by clever cloud, and are therefore not shared with third parties. if you do not wish to have your visits recorded, you can refer to the following instructions:
this processing is carried out on the basis of the legitimate interest of clever cloud to analyze the traffic of its website (article 6.1.f of the gdpr).
platform security, error management and access logging
in order to secure the platform, in particular by detecting attempted intrusions, fraud, illicit copying of content or denial of service attacks, and to detect any anomalies in the operation of the platform, clever cloud implements technical processes requiring the processing of personal data such as:
your ip address;
the user agent of your browser;
your login and passwords;
the source code of your applications (e.g. for automated malware detection);
a log of your activities and events on the platform (such as system error logs)
these processing operations are carried out on the basis of clever cloud’s legitimate interest in securing its services and the data of its customers, and ensuring the proper functioning of the platform (article 6.1.f of the gdpr).
in addition, in order to comply with its legal obligations to retain connection data, clever cloud retains for 1 year the aforementioned data related to your content (source code) creation, modification or deletion operations. the customer is reminded that it is up to him to collect and retain the connection data related to the contents of his own customers, in accordance with his own legal obligations.
administration and billing of your customer account
when you register on the platform and use it, you may provide clever cloud with data associated with your customer account such as:
your name
your marital status
your e-mail address
your phone number
your mailing address
your login
the organizations to which you are attached
your applications and associated data
this data is kept for the duration of the contract between you and us (based on article 6.1.b of the gdpr) for the purpose of managing and securing your customer account, as well as for billing our services. they may also be kept beyond this date, until the expiry of the retention periods imposed by our legal and regulatory constraints (on the basis of article 6.1.c of the gdpr).
the password associated with your login is never stored in clear text by clever cloud and you will never be asked for it anywhere other than on the interface that allows you to login to the platform, exclusively from the clever cloud website. you have the possibility to activate the two-factor authentication to reinforce the security of the access to your account. clever cloud encourages you to activate it to limit the risk that third parties fraudulently access your data.
the banking information you enter during a payment is processed exclusively by the clever cloud partner you choose at the time of payment:
stripe, whose privacy policy is available at: https://stripe.com/privacy
paypal, whose privacy policy is available at: https://www.paypal.com/fr/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full
technical and commercial support
in order to respond to requests for technical or commercial assistance from its customers, clever cloud may process the following data on the basis of the performance of the contract between you and clever cloud (article 6.1.b of the gdpr):
your ip address
the organizations to which your account is attached
your email address
your phone number
the content of your messages
the date and time of your last activity.
clever cloud shares this data with its partner crisp, exclusively for the purpose of processing your support request, whose privacy policy is available at https://crisp.chat/fr/privacy/
in this context, clever cloud deploys a messaging tool integrated to the platform, requiring the installation on your browser of crisp cookies. these cookies are necessary to restore chat sessions with the technical support team and to maintain the continuity of exchanges during your navigation in our pages. these cookies are kept under the conditions explained in crisp’s privacy policy.
if you call the hotline, your phone number is retained while we process your request. the data is shared with our voice server provider twilio, whose privacy policy is available at https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy
processing of applications (recruitment)
for its recruitment activities, on the basis of the need to process your applications (article 6.1.b of the gdpr) clever cloud must process the personal data that you provide in the process of your application, such as your full name, date of birth, addresses, telephone contact details, resumes, emails, dates and results of interviews, salary expectations,…
this data is kept for the time necessary to process your application and at the latest 12 months from the last contact, unless you authorize otherwise. it will not be passed on to third parties without your permission. if you apply from a third party service, you must read and agree to the service’s privacy policy.
2. security measures
clever cloud implements technical and organizational measures in order to secure the data you entrust to us as well as possible, for example by using encryption measures as systematically as possible, or by limiting access rights to data to employees and service providers who have a legitimate interest in accessing it within the framework of the missions entrusted to them.
clever cloud’s services creation processes incorporate stringent data security requirements from the outset, and are monitored throughout the development and subsequent upgrades, with continuous evaluation and improvement of security requirements.
data is hosted exclusively on servers managed by clever cloud, in highly secure data centers of your choice. you can find more information on how we secure your data and the security certifications of our data centers on the following page: https://www.clever-cloud.com/security/
