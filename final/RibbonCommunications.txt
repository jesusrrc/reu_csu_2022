standard data protection clauses adopted by the ec or the competent uk authority as applicable under gdpr article 46.
eu-us and swiss-us privacy shield
on 16 july 2020, the court of justice of the european union issued a judgment declaring as invalid the european commission’s decision (eu) 2016/1250 of 12 july 2016 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the eu-u.s. privacy shield framework. as a result of that decision, the eu-u.s. privacy shield framework is no longer a valid mechanism to comply with eu data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the european economic area to the united states. also, on 8 september 2020, the federal data protection and information commissioner (fdpic) of switzerland issued an opinion concluding that the swiss-u.s. privacy shield framework does not provide an adequate level of protection for data transfers from switzerland to the united states pursuant to switzerland’s federal act on data protection (fadp). accordingly, ribbon no longer relies on the privacy shield framework for transfers of personal data.
please note that the standard data protection clauses adopted by the ec under gdpr article 46 remain a valid mechanism to comply with eu, uk and swiss data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the european economic area, switzerland and the united kingdom to the united states. ribbon has implemented the standard data protection clauses.
notwithstanding the foregoing invalidation of privacy shield for transfers of personal data, ribbon communications inc. and its u.s. subsidiaries ribbon communications operating company, inc., eci telecom inc., edgewater networks, inc. and ribbon communications federal inc (“ribbon privacy shield companies”) continue to comply with the eu-u.s. privacy shield and the swiss-u.s. privacy shield frameworks (privacy shield) as set forth by the u.s. department of commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred prior to the invalidation of the privacy shield framework. the ribbon privacy shield companies have certified to the department of commerce that they adhere to the privacy shield principles. if there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the privacy shield principles, the privacy shield principles shall govern.
