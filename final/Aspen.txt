please note that other locally permissible legal bases of processing are available, but which are not required to be detailed in the table, with some specific details included in the jurisdiction-specific sections below.
if you have any queries in relation to the legal basis of processing for specific purposes, please contact the group data protection officer via email at [email protected] or the local representatives detailed in the jurisdiction-specific sections.
how long will the information be retained? addshow/hide content
the length of time for which your data will be retained will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:
legislative requirements;
aspen reporting requirements; and
operational requirements (e.g. claim or pension payment processing).
aspen seeks to minimize the time it retains data in line with the requirements of the gdpr or any local laws that apply in your jurisdiction, and maintains a comprehensive group records retention policy in order to achieve this aim. this policy and associated data retention schedules pertaining to each type of information can be obtained from aspen’s group data privacy officer at [email protected].
how we protect your data addshow/hide content
as required by applicable data protection and privacy law, aspen has physical, electronic and operational security procedures intended to safeguard and secure the information we collect throughout the lifecycle of that information. all aspen staff have a legal duty to respect the confidentiality of information and access to confidential information is restricted to only those who have a reasonable need to access it.
technical controls implemented include database encryption, email encryption, identity and access management solutions, comprehensive network protection and antivirus solutions.
aspen also protects your data contractually when sharing with third-parties, ensuring that at least an equivalent level of security is offered by our partners and suppliers.  these contracts incorporate the eu/uk standard contractual clauses where data is transferred without an adequacy decision.
automated decision making addshow/hide content
we do not make any decisions about you using automated means (without human review), however we will update our privacy notice if this position changes.
selling and / or sharing your data addshow/hide content
aspen does not sell any data to third parties for commercial purposes.
insurance involves the use and disclosure of your personal data by various insurance market participants such as intermediaries, insurers and reinsurers. the london insurance market core uses information notice sets out those core necessary personal data uses and disclosures. our core uses and disclosures are consistent with the london market core uses information notice (irrespective if you have a lloyd’s or non-lloyd’s policy), except as identified below, and we recommend that you review this notice.
in the course of providing services to you aspen may engage, and disclose your data to, a number of third party suppliers, e.g. claims handlers or employment services, in connection with services provided by them. at all times, aspen will require that the personal data is processed in accordance with our instructions and in circumstances which require the recipient to observe industry standard security measures in respect of personal data. we do not allow our third party suppliers to use your personal data for their own purpose.

changes to this notice or your personal information addshow/hide content

eu / eea residents
transferring your data outside of the eu
the personal data that we collect about you may be transferred to, and stored at, one or more countries outside the eea or outside the jurisdiction in which you reside. it may also be processed by staff operating outside the eea (or outside the jurisdiction in which you reside) who work for aspen or for our third party suppliers. in such cases, aspen will take appropriate steps to ensure an adequate level of data protection, including an appropriate “adequacy” decision, in the country of the recipient as required under the gdpr (or as required under local laws in your jurisdiction) and as described in this notice.
if aspen cannot ensure such an adequate level of data protection, your personal data will only be transferred outside the eea (or outside the jurisdiction in which you reside) if you have given your prior consent to such transfer and any local law requirements for the transfer have been satisfied. your personal data is currently processed in aspen’s operating jurisdictions (including the uk, us, bermuda, ireland, dubai, singapore, switzerland and australia) and india.
eu representative contact details
if you are located in the eu, then please make any requests via our eu representative (the dpo centre) at [email protected]
eu / eea data subject requests
if you wish to invoke any of your rights under relevant privacy regulations or to make a general enquiry regarding aspen’s approach to securing your data, please do so by contacting our eu / eea representative.
please note that only you or someone that you authorize to act on your behalf may submit these requests. your request must provide sufficient information for us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information and sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to your request.
in response to such request, we may also ask you to verify your identity or to provide additional information that helps us to understand your request better. once we have the necessary information from you regarding proof of identity, or in the case of an agent, proof of authorization, and your request is valid, we will respond to you as soon as possible but no later than within 30 days unless the number and complexity of the requests made be deemed excessively high, in which case we may extend this time by a maximum of a further two months. we will inform you if we need to make use of this additional time and why we need to do so as soon as is practicably possible.
uk residents
transferring your data outside of the uk
the personal data that we collect about you may be transferred to, or stored at, one or more of aspen’s locations outside of the uk.
following the uk’s departure from the eu, the eu authorities have made an adequacy decision in respect of the uk. this means that the uk is deemed to provide an essentially equivalent level of protection for personal data to that which exists within the eu. in turn, the uk government has made an adequacy decision in respect of the eu. on that basis, data can flow freely between the two areas. irrespective of this, aspen will continue to ensure that any recipient of data provides at least the same level of protection as we would ourselves.
please note that the uk’s adequacy status has been limited to a period of 4 years from 1 january 2021.
transfers of your personal data to jurisdictions outside of the uk and eea will be made subject to similar safeguards and considerations to those that apply to the personal data eu/eea residents (see section above).
special note on consent for policyholders, beneficiaries and claimants
under the uk gdpr, we do not need your consent if we use your pii (including special category data) to carry out insurance processing activities or to meet our legal obligations in the field of insurance law. in very limited circumstances, and where applicable, we may approach you for your written consent to allow us to process special category data. please see the “explicit consent” category under the legal bases section above for further details.
data subject requests
if you wish to invoke any of your rights under relevant privacy regulations or to make a general enquiry regarding aspen’s approach to securing your data, please do so by contacting aspen’s group data protection officer.
please note that only you or someone that you authorize to act on your behalf may submit these requests. your request must provide sufficient information for us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information and sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to your request.
in response to such request, we may also ask you to verify your identity or to provide additional information that helps us to understand your request better. once we have the necessary information from you regarding proof of identity, or in the case of an agent, proof of authorization, and your request is valid, we will respond to you as soon as possible but no later than within 30 days unless the number and complexity of the requests made be deemed excessively high, in which case we may extend this time by a maximum of a further two months. we will inform you if we need to make use of this additional time and why we need to do so as soon as is practicably possible.
