wangsu takes the following processing means for the above data that wangsu collects:
regarding the personal data in customer’s content, namely, end users’ personal data wangsu’s customers collect, process and transfer end users’ personal data through their own websites, and wangsu mainly conducts processing of customers’ website content on behalf of these customers. that what personal data of users that a website ultimately collects, whether it uses the information on its website, and whether such personal data of end users are cached on wangsu’s servers and the duration of caching, and whether encrypted network transmission, collection and processing are conducted using the security services that wangsu provides, are all determined by the customer through its website’s functional design and by inputting orders in wangsu’s customer service systems. wangsu will determine the caching means and optimum transmission path of end users’ personal data based on such necessary parameters as customer setting and network congestion condition.
therefore, customers should be responsible for the legitimacy of relevant data processing, specifically, they should observe the laws and regulations that apply in the service area, assume the obligation for disclosure to end users, obtain the consent of end users regarding relevant data processing, tell end users the available means for exercising their rights for personal data protection, and select the service type that is suitable for transmitting personal data of end users.
unless according to the stipulations of laws or the requirements of services that customers purchase, wangsu will not conduct extra storage or processing of the personal data of end users. if end users and supervision entities have any question or demand about data processing, wangsu will make all efforts to help pass on the question or demand to wangsu’s customers, and wangsu’s customers shall be responsible for responding to this demand, and shall not process arbitrarily.
regarding the personal data that are contained in log data, i.e, the personal data in logs;
based on such needs as providing customers with products of service performance and data analysis, providing anti-fraud and bot management functions, improving service, and improving use experiences of end users, wangsu needs to accurately identify malicious network traffic, refuse malicious access requirements, and avoid denying of normal access at the same time. this further requires wangsu to conduct traffic analysis of its network based on the personal data in logs that are collected from the websites’ sessions or the browsers of end users.
the threat data that are obtained from this are integrated to wangsu’s tools, products and services, so as to protect wangsu and its customers from harm as a result of network attack, hacker attack, malicious software, viruses, fraud activities, and other malicious activities.
wangsu also will conduct processing of personal information in the logs for the purposes of billing, solving service problems or improving services, addressing service faults and summarizing reports. in relevant reports that are publicly issued (i.e. “internet report”), personal data shall be masked.
for example, wangsu analyzes an end user’s service quality by collecting personal data in the logs, considering the end user’s ip, the ip’s rough geographic information, time stamps, urls, and activity data; and it analyzes the quality of wangsu’s idc and the connection between them based on the activity data and the duration of access; and it analyzes the threat information of ip addresses based on ip, time stamps, browser information, access duration and remote sensing data; and it adjusts service and security strategies based on a customer’s configuration and wangsu’s scheduling strategy, so as to improve the use experience of end users, and provide customers with service quality reports, and accurately shield from attacking ip addresses that pose threats to wangsu or customers.
