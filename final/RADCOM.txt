introduction
introduction
radcom ltd. including its subsidiaries and affiliates (“radcom”, “we” or “us”) has created this privacy notice to demonstrate our firm commitment to secure and trustworthy internet commerce and the individual’s right to privacy. this privacy notice sets radcom’s privacy policies and practices in relation to information that is collected by us through radcom’s website (https://www.radcom.com), and any web-pages included thereto (collectively: the “website”).
we strongly urge you to read this privacy notice and make sure that you fully understand and agree to it. if you do not agree to this notice, please discontinue and avoid browsing and/or make any other use of the website.
please review section ‎4 below to understand what kind of personal data we collect.
in the event that you are making available any personal information other than your own via the website (including any communication means) to us and/or any other entity, then you will be solely responsible to obtain all consents and approvals from the respective data subjects and be further to have them acknowledge this privacy notice.
your consent
we will collect and process your personal data as described in this privacy notice. where applicable, we will obtain your consent for such collection and/or use. however, with respect to personal data which we collect for certain purposes reflecting our legitimate interests, your browsing of the website, will be deemed as your consent.
for what purposes do we use your information?
we will use your personal data in a scope and manner that is in accordance with your consent; for complying with applicable law; and based on our legitimate interest to maintain and improve our website and the content included thereto, understanding how our website is used and protecting and securing our users, ourselves and our website.
accordingly, we use personal data in order to contact our users via e-mail with general and/or service-related messages, specifically through the distribution of a newsletter.
promotional communications. subject to legal restrictions, we may also contact you via the e-mail address you provide us with in order to notify you about new services, or any other information we think you will find valuable.
if you wish not to receive such promotional communications, you may notify us at any time by contacting us via the email address set forth below, or by following the “unsubscribe”, “stop” or “change e-mail preferences” instructions in the promotional communications you receive.
how do we collect your information?
we collect two main categories of data through the website (and to the extent it may enable the identification of a specific person or is linked to such potentially identifying data, we will deem it as “personal data”):
data automatically collected or generated. when you visit, interact with or use our website, including any e-mail sent to you by us, we may collect or generate technical data about you. we collect or generate such data either independently or with the help of third-party services, including through the use of “cookies” and other tracking technologies (as further detailed in our “cookies policy”).
such data consists of connectivity, technical or aggregated usage data, such as ip address, non-identifying data regarding the device, operating system, browser version locale and language settings used, the cookies and pixels installed on such device, and the activity (clicks and other interactions) of users of our website.
we do not use such data to learn a user’s true identity or contact details, but mostly to have a better understanding of how our users typically use our website. the use of such technical and device data also helps us and our partners to deliver contextual or otherwise more effective content; to optimize our users’ viewing experience, and to improve the overall user experience and functionality of our website.
data received from you. you may provide us personal data voluntarily, such as your name, e-mail address, phone number, and location when you contact us, or when you register to the newsletter available through the website.
if you choose to give us your e-mail address, we will communicate with you via e-mail. we do not share your e-mail address with others outside of radcom. depending on how your e-mail application is set up, information about your actions, use of the e-mail sent by us, may be transmitted automatically when you receive, open and/ or click on an e-mail from radcom. in any event, you may opt out from receipt of any additional e-mails from radcom, at any time.
you may request to receive access to the data collected by sending us an email. you may also revise such information or ask that such information be deleted.
how do we retain and store your information?
radcom is based in a jurisdiction which is considered by the european commission to be offering an adequate level of protection for the personal data of eu member state residents which radcom shall abide by.
while privacy laws may vary between jurisdictions, radcom has taken reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data is treated by its affiliates and service providers in a secure and lawful manner, and in accordance with common industry practices, regardless of any lesser legal requirements that may apply in their jurisdiction.
we retain personal data for various reasons and periods of time, as required by applicable laws or for the performance by contracts we are bound to and/or to fulfill our legitimate interests and/or as permitted by applicable laws.
please note that except as required by applicable law, we will not be obligated to retain your data for any particular period, and are free to securely delete it for any reason and at any time, with or without notice to you.
whom do we share information with?
we may share your data (including personal data) with certain third parties, including law enforcement agencies, our service providers, and our affiliates – but only in accordance with this privacy notice:
compliance with laws, legal orders, and authorities. we may disclose or allow government and law enforcement officials to gain access to certain personal data, in response to a subpoena, search warrant or court order (or similar requirement), or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including for national security purposes. such disclosure or access may occur with or without notice to you if we have a good faith belief that we are legally compelled to do so, or that disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing.
service providers and business partners. we may engage selected third party companies and individuals to perform services complementary to our own (such as hosting services, data analytics services, user engagement services, e-mail distribution, and monitoring services, and our business, legal, financial, and compliance advisors) (collectively, “service providers”). these service providers may have access to your personal data, depending on each of their specific roles and purposes in facilitating the purposes of our website, and may only use it for such purposes.
