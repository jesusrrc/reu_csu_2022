online privacy policy agreement
vision technologies (vision) values its users' privacy. this privacy policy ("policy") will help you understand how we collect and use personal information from those who visit our website or make use of our online facilities and services, and what we will and will not do with the information we collect. our policy has been designed and created to ensure those affiliated with vision technologies of our commitment and realization of our obligation not only to meet, but to exceed, most existing privacy standards.
we reserve the right to make changes to this policy at any given time. if you want to make sure that you are up to date with the latest changes, we advise you to frequently visit this page. if at any point in time vision technologies decides to make use of any personally identifiable information on file, in a manner vastly different from that which was stated when this information was initially collected, the user or users shall be promptly notified by email. users at that time shall have the option as to whether to permit the use of their information in this separate manner.

please note that this policy does not govern the collection and use of information by companies that vision technologies does not control, nor by individuals not employed or managed by us. if you visit a website that we mention or link to, be sure to review its privacy policy before providing the site with information. it is highly recommended and suggested that you review the privacy policies and statements of any website you choose to use or frequent to better understand the way in which websites garner, make use of and share the information collected.
specifically, this policy will inform you of the following:
what personally identifiable information is collected from you through our website;
why we collect personally identifiable information and the legal basis for such collection;
how we use the collected information and with whom it may be shared;
what choices are available to you regarding the use of your data; and
the security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
information we collect
it is always up to you whether to disclose personally identifiable information to us, although if you elect not to do so, we reserve the right not to register you as a user or provide you with any products or services. this website collects various types of information, such as voluntarily provided information which may include your name, address, email address, billing and/or credit card information etc. which may be used when you purchase products and/or services and to deliver the services you have requested.
in addition, vision technologies may have the occasion to collect non-personal anonymous demographic information, such as age, gender, household income, political affiliation, race and religion, as well as the type of browser you are using, ip address, or type of operating system, which will assist us in providing and maintaining superior quality service.
please rest assured that this site will only collect personal information that you knowingly and willingly provide to us by way of surveys, completed membership forms, and emails. it is the intent of this site to use personal information only for the purpose for which it was requested, and any additional uses specifically provided for on this policy.
why we collect information and for how long
