notice to california residents
under california law, california residents may request a list of categories of personal information that has been disclosed to third-parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year and the third-parties that were provided this information. individuals may also request that their personal information be deleted.   users, customers, and attendees may make such a request or direct any question to:
mcloudattn: privacy inquiries580 california street, 12th floorsan francisco, california 94104email: info@mcloudcorp.com
direct marketing includes marketing directly to individuals by mail, phone, or e-mail for personal purposes.  mcloud does not sell any personal information to third-parties for their own direct marketing purposes, but we recognize that some state privacy laws define “personal information” in such a way that some sharing of personal information necessary to provide you with personalized ads may be considered a “sale,” even if no money is exchanged.
how are do not track requests handled?
various browsers offer users an option known as a do not track header that allows users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites.  each browser handles dnt trackers differently.
mcloud currently does not respond to do not track requests because no dnt standard has been adopted and we cannot promise we will be able to receive or honor browser dnt signals.
