privacy policy
infinite computer solutions inc.
we respect your privacy. this privacy policy and agreement (this "privacy policy" or "policy") describes how we collect, use, and treat personal information that you provide to infinite computer solutions inc. ("infinite", "we", "our", or "us"): (i) through our website at https://www.infinite.com (our "website" or "site"); (ii) by contacting us directly by phone, email, or other communications channel; or (iii) while otherwise using the services and information available via the website or otherwise (collectively, the "services") (the services, together with our website, are referred to as the "platform").
please read this privacy policy carefully. once you consent to this privacy policy and its terms, it creates legal obligations on you and infinite. our privacy policy applies to anyone using our website or otherwise participating in our services (collectively, "you" and "your").
your consent to this privacy policy
you indicate your consent to this privacy policy by using our website or otherwise participating in our services. we may also request your express consent when we collect personal information from you. in any case, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood this privacy policy, and agree to be legally bound by it. if you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, then please do not use our platform.
the information we collect
to provide our services, and to otherwise conduct our business, we rely on information provided by and collected from, our users. this information consists of the following:
personal information
we collect certain information that identifies you as an individual and may associate other data with such information (collectively, "personal information"). the personal information we collect may include the following:
your name, phone number, email address, and other contact information ;
the agency or organization that you represent and your title;
your geolocation information;
any information or feedback you provide to us through our platform or via social media, email, or phone; and
your transactions with us.
if you provide us with any personal information relating to another individual, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information under this privacy policy.
anonymous information
we may also have (i) information that does not identify you or your devices, and (ii) de-identified personal information that no longer identifies you (collectively, "anonymous information"). information that meets either of these criteria may include, for example, certain demographic information, statistical information (e.g., page views and hit counts), and general tracking information. we use anonymous information for our business operations, such as to improve our platform. because anonymous information does not include personal information, any anonymous information, and our use of it, is not subject to this privacy policy.
treatment of combined information
if we combine online activity information or anonymous information with personal information, then we will treat the resulting combination as personal information subject to the terms of this privacy policy. moreover, we may combine personal information that you provide to us with other data for our business operations and other purposes specified in this privacy policy. if the information we combine in this manner includes your personal information, we will treat the combined information as your personal information for all purposes under this privacy policy.
