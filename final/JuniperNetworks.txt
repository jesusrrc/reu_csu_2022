what we do
we, juniper networks, inc., 1133 innovation way, sunnyvale, california 94089 usa, and other companies in juniper networks, inc.’s group worldwide, including mist systems, inc. (collectively, “juniper networks”), provide telecommunications network infrastructure products and solutions for enterprise networks, for the cloud and for service providers (collectively, the “juniper products”). our technology includes, for example, routers, switches, network management software and network security products, both wired and wireless. you can find examples of our products, solutions and services here: https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products.html.
we typically distribute juniper products through resellers and partners. in cases where juniper products are used by our customers and partners on their own premises and in their own cloud account(s), we generally do not have access to the data (whether personal data or other confidential data of our customers or partners) processed by the juniper products unless we are providing installation services, customer support or success services, quality assurance, testing or other professional services. when we do have access to personal information of individuals, it is typically as a service provider/supplier to our customers and partners, with limited exceptions, such as, for example:
for our websites www.juniper.net and https://www.mist.com/, related sub-sites and other websites and mobile applications that we provide (the “websites,” which are included in the juniper products).
for our advertising, marketing, promotion, industry outreach and educational efforts (which are primarily in a business-to-business context versus direct to individual consumers).
in our relationships with operational vendors and suppliers.
in our role as a service provider/supplier, our contracts generally restrict us from processing personal information of our customers and partners except for the purposes permitted under our contracts and under applicable law.
this privacy policy is provided publicly including as notice to juniper networks’ current and prospective customers and partners (including suppliers, vendors, resellers, oems, distributors and other third parties), end users of any juniper products, and visitors to, and users of, our websites.
