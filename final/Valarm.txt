valarm™ privacy policy
last updated november 24, 2012
valarm™ is concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and disclose personally identifiable information when you use our sites or applications.
this privacy statement (the “privacy statement”) describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through our products and applications, through a user account registered on valarm.net or when you interact with our support personnel. to the extent that we process information for which opt-in consent is required under applicable laws, we will ask you for such opt-in consent. you may withdraw this opt-in consent at any time. other valarm™ sites, or certain activities on other sites relating to valarm™, are governed by privacy practices different from those set forth below. we encourage you to check the privacy statement of each valarm™ site that you visit. to learn about our general online practices, go to https://www.valarm.net/privacy
1. what types of information does valarm™ collect
we gather two basic types of information: “personally identifiable information” (“pii”) and “non-personally identifiable information” (“non-pii”).
a. personally identifiable information: we collect pii used in conjunction with your valarm™  account or when you contact our customer service center, such as your name, address, telephone numbers, email address, or account details. we may combine the information that you submit under your account with information we collect from our products or applications or that we receive from third parties, in order to provide you applications and services and to improve the quality of our products and applications. we may also collect pii when you use our products or applications or enable certain features on one of our products or applications. such pii may include location information collected from wireless devices or from cell towers. you may also voluntarily provide pii when you provide points of interest feedback, reviews, or comments on valarm™ licensed content.
b. non-personally identifiable information: valarm™ also collects non-pii from personal mobile device. if a mobile device is not registered on valarm.net, information collected is not associated with any particular user and thus is non-pii. for instance, valarm™ may collect information relating to how often a device is turned on and for how long or the frequency with which certain applications and features of the product or service are used. valarm™ may also collect information, including but not limited to, relating to which advertisements were viewed, how often they were clicked and how often certain actions were taken.
when you use valarm™ products and applications or access your account on valarm.net, we automatically record log information. these server logs may include information such as, including but not limited to, your internet protocol (ip) address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, the time(s) of your visit(s) and the web page(s) that you visited. under certain laws, this log information may be considered pii.
2. valarm’s use of information
a. personally identifiable information (pii): we may use pii about you for the purposes listed below. if we intend to use pii about you for a purpose that is incompatible with these purposes or if we intend to disclose pii about you to a type of third party not previously identified in this privacy statement, we will notify you and offer you the opportunity to opt out of such use and/or disclosure.
(i) general. we and our service providers use pii in order to allow you to utilize the valarm™ service and to allow you to update the software on your device or to respond to a customer service request. we may also use pii about you for internal business purposes, such as to gauge customer satisfaction and to improve our products and services.
(ii) location information. your physical location, or the physical location of your device(s) is/are collected using satellites, wi-fi networks, and cell phone towers in order to provide you with certain location-based services to enhance our products and applications
(iii) track logs. when you connect your device to the internet, and if you provide consent, you may upload from your device to valarm™ certain historical information, including, but not limited to, location information that is stored on your device, which we and our third party application and content providers will use to enhance our and their products and applications. (depending on your configuration the uploaded information can, but does not have to, include environmental information, including but not limited to any of the following: current location, ambient light levels, noise levels, pictures, temperature, humidity, various vehicle data such as revolutions per minute, engine data.)
(iv) communications. we may use pii about you to send you information about valarm’s programs, invite you to participate in special programs, re-contact you if we have not heard from you in a while and, occasionally, electronically send you advertising/promotional material about valarm™ and selected partner products and applications. you may opt out of receiving certain future marketing information or promotional communications (see section 8 (opt-out/choice) below). however, regardless of your opt-out preferences, valarm™ may still at times need to send emails for administrative or transactional reasons (e.g., to provide you with important information regarding valarm.net or a product or service, or changes to our terms of use, and policies). because this information may be important to your use of valarm.net or our products and applications, you may not opt out of receiving such communications.
(v) customer support. when you interact with our customer services representatives via web-forum, email, telephone, or in person we may collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences; and information relating to a support or service issue.
(viii) compliance with applicable law. we may need to collect and retain pii about you in order to comply with applicable laws and to respond to requests from public authorities, including public authorities outside your country of residence.
b. non-personally identifiable information: because non-pii does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose. valarm™ collects non-pii from devices, including but not limited to, devices that are not registered on valarm.net and thus are not associated with any pii. we may use this information to detect broad demographic trends and to otherwise enhance our products or applications. we reserve the right to share such non-pii, which does not personally identify you, with third parties, for any purpose.
in some instances, we may combine non-pii with pii (such as combining your name with your zip code). if we do combine any non-pii with pii, we will treat the combined information as pii for as long as it is combined.
c. server log information: we and our service providers use server log information including ip addresses for purposes such as calculating site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with valarm.net servers, administering valarm.net and for the other purposes set forth in section 2(a), and we may disclose ip addresses as set forth in section 3 below. collecting ip addresses is standard practice on the internet and is done automatically by many web sites. please note that we treat ip addresses, server log files, and related information as non-pii, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable laws.
3. disclosure of information
as described below, valarm™ may share pii, including information that you provide on valarm.net or information collected through our products or services, with third parties that may be located around the world.
a. affiliated entities: we may share information, including pii that you provide on valarm.net or through our products or services, with our subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide, for the purposes described in this privacy statement.
b. strategic partners and co-branded sites: from time to time, we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by or affiliated with valarm™ to provide additional features on valarm.net, valarm™ service and/or applications. these special relationships may include co-branded sites (“co-branded pages”). any information, including pii, that you provide in connection with one of these applications or products, and/or on one of these co-branded pages, will be shared with these third party partners. by selecting an application or providing your information on these co-branded pages, by using  co-branded products or by signing up for an application, you also consent to our providing pii about you to those third parties. however, please note that as third parties generally use pii about you in accordance with their own privacy practices, you should check these third parties’ web sites for information regarding their privacy practices. please note that this privacy statement does not address the privacy or information practices of any third parties. if you do not want pii about you shared with such third parties, please do not provide pii in connection with the applications or products provided by third parties and/or pages that are co-branded with third parties.
(i) location information: when you sign up for certain applications, your physical location will be collected from cell towers, wi-fi networks, and satellites and shared with our strategic partners. valarm™ may share information relating to your location, speed, and direction with the third party in order to enhance the application. this information will be provided in the sole discretion of valarm™.
(ii) marketing partners: on some of our applications and products, advertisements are displayed. we will share information, including but not limited to, location information as well as information about what advertisements you viewed with our marketing partners so that they can provide you with content that is more relevant and study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
note that this privacy statement does not address the privacy or information practices of any third parties.
c. service providers: we may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and valarm.net or administer activities on our behalf. we may share pii about you with these third parties for those limited purposes. these service providers are given access to pii needed to perform their functions, but are restricted from using the pii for purposes other than providing services for us.
d. law enforcement; assignment: we reserve the right to disclose pii, and any other information, about you to others as we believe to be appropriate: (a) under applicable law or regulation, including laws or regulations outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public authorities and law enforcement officials, including public authorities and law enforcement officials outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates and subsidiaries; (f) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of valarm™, its affiliates and subsidiaries, you, or others; and (g) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
further, we reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from you or from other users to an affiliate, a subsidiary, or a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of valarm™’s business, assets, or stock (including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding).
4. links, third party applications, and third parties’ privacy practices
valarm.net, as well as our applications and products, may contain links to other sites that are not operated by valarm™. these linked sites, services, and applications (including, without limitation, the web sites of strategic partners) are not under valarm’s control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such linked sites, services, and applications, or any link contained in any linked sites, services, and applications. we provide such links or applications only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on valarm.net or application does not imply endorsement of the linked sites, services, and/or application by valarm™ or any affiliates or subsidiaries of valarm™. if you provide any pii through any such third-party sites, services, or applications, your transaction will occur on the third party’s site, service, and/or application (not valarm.net or valarm™) and the pii you provide will be collected by, and controlled by, the privacy policy of that third party. valarm™ is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other web sites’ third-party applications. valarm™ recommends that you review the privacy policy of third parties.
5. other disclosures
certain features (e.g., the camera and email features on your mobile device) allow you to tag location information and share that information with others. you should exercise caution when using these features and when sharing location information.
certain features also allow you to monitor people, places, and other things, remotely. you should exercise caution and abide by any applicable state, federal, and local laws, rules and regulations, when using these features.
6. security
valarm™ takes reasonable security measures to help protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, and unauthorized disclosure or alteration of the pii under its control. unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. as a result, although we strive to protect pii about you, we cannot ensure the security of any information that you transmit to us through or in connection with valarm.net or applications, or that is stored by us. if you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with section 12 (contacting valarm™) below (note that notification by physical mail will increase the time it takes before we can begin to respond to the problem).
7. jurisdictional issues
valarm.net is controlled and operated by valarm™ from the united states, and is not intended to subject valarm™ to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country, or territory other than that of the united states. those who choose to access valarm.net do so of their own initiative and are responsible for complying with all federal, state, and/or local laws, rules and regulations. we may limit the availability of valarm.net, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and at our sole discretion.
8. opt-out/choice
a. opt-out. if you do not wish to receive marketing-related emails from us you may opt out of receiving such marketing-related emails by emailing opt-out@valarm.net. please specify clearly that you want to opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails.
we will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. if you wish to cease receiving marketing-related emails from such third parties, please contact those third parties directly, or utilize any opt-out mechanisms set forth in their respective privacy policies or marketing-related emails.
special notification for california residents — your privacy rights. individual customers who reside in california and have provided personal information to valarm™ may request information about valarm’s disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. such requests must be submitted to us at the address listed in section 12 below. this request may be made no more than once per calendar year.
9. use of our products and applications by children
our products and applications are not directed to individuals under the age of eighteen (18), and we request that such individuals not provide information through valarm.net or through our products and applications.
10. updates to this privacy statement
we reserve the right to change this privacy statement from time to time as we add new products and applications, as we improve our current offerings, and as technologies change. you can determine when this privacy statement was last revised by referring to the “last updated” legend at the top of this page. any changes will become effective upon our posting of the revised privacy statement on valarm.net. if we make any material or substantive changes to our treatment of personally identifiable information, we will notify you of this by posting a clear and conspicuous notice of these changes on valarm.net. you agree to be bound by these terms when you use valarm.net and valarm.net’s associated products. to the extent that the changes affect information for which opt-in consent is required under applicable laws, we will ask you for your consent.
11. reviewing/correcting/updating information; data integrity
valarm™ takes reasonable steps to ensure that all pii is relevant to and reliable for its intended use. we will also endeavor to ensure that the information is accurate, complete, and current. you may request access and request that erroneous or inaccurate pii related to you that is held by us be rectified or suppressed. you have several options for reviewing, correcting, updating, or otherwise modifying pii about you:
you may send an email to: privacy@valarm.net
you can update your information on our website: www.valarm.net. please note that, for your protection, we may need to verify your identity before making any changes to pii about you. you must clearly indicate the information that you wish to have changed, or clearly indicate that you wish to have pii about you removed from our active database. please note that changes may not be effective immediately. further, please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, and there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records. finally, we are not responsible for removing information from or updating information in the databases of third parties with whom we have already shared pii about you.
