panduit privacy notice
panduit privacy notice
effective date: january 1, 2020; last reviewed on: june 1, 2020

this privacy notice describes how panduit corp., its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “panduit”) as a business-to-business organization appropriately collects, uses, and shares the personal information of users of the panduit website and mobile applications, direct customers, indirect customers who purchase panduit products and services through panduit’s authorized distribution channel, including end users, indirect resellers, installers, and other contractors, members of the onesm partner ecosystem, and vendors.  this privacy notice does not apply to events sponsored or co-sponsored by panduit—you will receive an event-specific privacy notice if you register for an event.  this privacy notice also explains the options you have to manage your personal information.  this privacy notice is compatible with audio-readers such as read aloud.
we may update this privacy notice from time to time. if we do, we’ll let you know about any material changes, either by notifying you here or by sending you an email.

why personal information do we collect?
we may collect or obtain the following categories of personal information:
contact information (like your first name, last name, email, social media handle, telephone number, fax number, mailing address, and/or country);
account log-in credentials (username, password);
professional and employment-related information (like your title, industry, profession and employer);
payment information, including payment card numbers, and bank account information);
records of correspondence;
records of products and services you have purchased, obtained, and considered;
audio recordings when you call customer service;
visual recordings when you visit a panduit facility;
geolocation data when you use a panduit mobile application; and
any other information you provide to us.

in addition to the above, we may also collect other information related to user interactions with our website and mobile applications (“usage data”).  much of this usage data, such as clickstream data and aggregate usage statistics, do not identify a particular individual. however, some of this usage data either alone or when combined or linked with your personal information, may allow your identity to be discovered. in such cases, we treat the combined data as personal information. in many cases, usage data are gathered automatically by systems or technology such as cookies.

examples of usage data that may be collected by panduit include:
details about your computers, devices, applications, and networks (including ip address, browser characteristics, device id, cookie/session id, authentication information, browser type/version, operating system/platform, and language preferences);
activities on our websites and mobile applications, including your search terms, pages viewed, clicks, downloads, dates and times of visits, and other usage patterns.

how do we collect information?
information that you give us: typically, we obtain information directly from you and you decide how much information to share with us.
information collected automatically: when you use or interact with our websites and mobile applications, we receive and store usage data as described in section 1 above.  in most cases, this information is generated by various tracking technologies.  while some of these technologies depend on the use of a cookie, visitors to the panduit website have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences.  in the event you visit a panduit facility, there may be security cameras that capture your image.  in the event you call customer service, that call may be recorded for quality assurance and training purposes.
information from other sources: your organization may provide details about you to facilitate your engagement with panduit or another organization (e.g. the host of an event or webinar) may do so upon your request.  we may also supplement our records of you to ensure we have accurate information about your industry or profession with information provided by consumer data resellers.  we may also receive your usage data (as defined in section 1 above) from data analytics providers.

how do we use personal information?
we may use the personal information we collect for one or more of the following business purposes:
create, maintain, customize, and secure your account with us;
provide our products, services and programs, including our websites and mobile applications, and improve them over time;
process payments and facilitate deliveries;
perform accounting, auditing, billing, reconciliation, and collection activities;
carrying out our obligations and enforcing our rights arising from agreements entered into between you and us;
provide customer support, and respond to requests, questions, and comments, including monitoring and improving our responses;
advertising, marketing, and selling our products and services;
personalize your website and mobile application experience, and deliver panduit content, product, service, and program offerings relevant to your interests, including targeted offers and ads through our websites, mobile applications, email, text message/sms, telephone, fax, or mail (with your consent when required by law);
linking together or merging personal information with other personal information so that we may better understand your needs and inform you about our products, services, and programs;
anonymizing and aggregating information for analytics and reporting purposes;
help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our website, mobile applications, products, services, programs, offerings, databases, and other technology assets, and business;
evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by us about our users is among the assets transferred;
comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements;
as described to you when collecting your personal information;
for any other purpose with your consent.

how do we share personal information?
we may share the personal information we collect in one of the following ways:
service providers.  we may disclose personal information to our service providers to perform functions on our behalf consistent with the descriptions set forth in section 3 above (e.g. website hosting provider, customer relationship management provider) pursuant to written agreements with confidentiality, privacy, and security obligations.
government entities.  we may disclose personal information as necessary or appropriate under applicable laws to comply with legal processes or requirements; respond to requests from public or government authorities; and protect our operations, rights and safety.

third-party advertising
we partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites. our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on these sites and other sites in order to provide you panduit advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests (“retargeting”). if you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by emailing privacy@panduit.com.

what choices do you have about your personal information?
in addition to the rights discussed in other sections of this notice, you may choose not to receive marketing communications from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link found in our marketing emails, or contacting us as specified in section 14 “contact us” below.
if you choose to no longer receive marketing information, panduit may still communicate with you regarding such topics as customer service, responses to inquiries, or other transactional, non-marketing related purposes.
if you have created an account with our distributor portal or  onesm partner portal at www.panduit.com, you can log-in to modify or update your information.

what security measures do we use?
panduit implements physical, administrative, and technical safeguards designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. we also contractually require that our suppliers protect such information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.

data retention and erasure
subject to applicable laws and as otherwise stated in sections 12 and 13 below, your personal information will be retained for as long as panduit has a legitimate reason to do so and will thereafter be deleted.

open forums
if you participate in a discussion forum or chat room on a panduit website, you should be aware that the information you provide will be made broadly available to others, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes neither panduit nor you have control. panduit is not responsible for the personal information or any other information you choose to submit in these forums.

links to other sites
our websites and mobile applications may contain links to other sites for your convenience and information. these sites may be operated by companies not affiliated with panduit. linked sites may have their own privacy policies, which you should review. panduit is not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or use of any websites that are not affiliated with panduit.

children’s data
our websites and applications are not directed to children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information directly from children under 16.  if you believe that we are processing the personal information pertaining to a child improperly, we take this very seriously and urge you to contact us using the information provided under the “contact us” section below.
