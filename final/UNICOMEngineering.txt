unicom engineering's commitment to privacy
this privacy statement regarding customer and online user information (“privacy statement”) applies to unicom engineering, inc. and its worldwide subsidiaries (“unicom,” "we" or "our"), but not to those unicom subsidiaries that have published their own privacy and security statements. this privacy statement also does not apply to the websites of our business partners or to any other third parties, even if their websites are linked to our website. we recommend you review the privacy statements of the other parties with which you interact.
this privacy statement governs personal information we collect from our customers and online users ("you"), as well as information we automatically collect from your online visits (e.g., data collected via cookies).
for the purposes of this privacy statement, "third party marketing consultants" means any subcontractor, vendor or other entity with whom we have an ongoing business relationship to provide marketing products, services or information. "personal information" means information that identifies you, such as your name, telephone number, and email address.
information we collect
we may ask you to provide personal information when you:
use our websites;
register or access the customer portal;
request quotes, support services, downloads, whitepapers or information;
register for meetings, events or webinars;
participate in surveys, or other promotional activities online or in any other venue;
subscribe to newsletters, promotional emails, or other materials; or
contact us
personal information we request may include your email address, name, job title, company name and telephone number. we may also collect demographic information, such as your business or company information, interests, and preferences. forms that you choose to complete will indicate whether information requested is mandatory or voluntary.
we may collect information about your visits to our websites, including the pages you view, the links and advertisements you click, search terms you enter, and other actions you take in connection with unicom websites and services. we may also collect certain information from the browser you used to come to our website, such as your internet protocol (ip) address, browser type and language, access times, the uniform resource locator (url) of the website that referred you to our website, and to which url you browse away from our site if you click on a link on our site.
in order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with unicom, information collected through one source may be combined with information unicom obtains through third party marketing consultants. this may include information that allows us to identify you across multiple devices through which you access our websites.
how we use personal information
unicom uses your personal information to:
deliver the services and support or carry out the transactions you have requested;
send communications to you, such as information about particular unicom programs in which you have chosen to participate, information about products and services available from unicom and its subsidiaries, promotional offers and surveys
customize, analyze, and improve our products, services (including the content on our website), communications and relationship with you;
enforce website terms and/or separate contracts (if applicable) with you;
prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities;
protect the security or integrity of our website(s), our business(es), or our products or services; or
otherwise, as disclosed to you at the point of collection.
personal information collected may be stored and processed in the united states or any other country in which unicom or our third party marketing consultants maintain facilities.
disclosing personal information
unicom engineering does not sell or distribute your personal data to third parties for direct marketing purposes. we may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal data regarding visitors and users with third parties, for the purposes outlined above. please see our cookie policy for more information about this sharing.
we do employ third party service providers to assist us with our marketing activities and or support services. we will only provide those third parties the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
we may also disclose your personal information in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention or other legal action; as required by law or regulation; if unicom (or a part of unicom) is sold or merges with another company; or if unicom reasonably believes it is necessary to protect unicom, its customers, or the public.
how you can access your information
unicom wants to help you keep your personal information accurate. upon request, we will provide you with reasonable access to the personal information we collect about you. you will have the opportunity to correct, update, modify, or delete this information by sending an email to privacy@unicomengineering.com. to file a complaint, direct messages to privacy@unicomengineering.com or send a written message postmarked to the address within our contact us section of this policy. in addition, you can adjust your marketing email communication preferences (newsletters, blogs, etc.) by following the link to the subscription center contained in the footer of every outbound email from unicom. we will store your information for eighteen (18) months from last action on our website and/or email communications. please note that some information may remain in our records even after you request deletion of your information as permitted by law.
please allow up to 10 business days for your email preferences to take effect. because some promotions are developed in advance, you may sometimes receive solicitations after we receive your preference request.
how we secure your personal information
unicom takes all reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference, and loss, as well as unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. the ways we do this include:
limiting physical access to our premises;
