right to erasure you have a right to the immediate deletion ("right to be forgotten") of the personal data concerning you if the legal grounds pursuant to art. 17 gdpr exist. these are, for example, if the personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were originally processed or you have withdrawn your consent and there is no other legal basis for the processing; the data subject objects to the processing (and there are no overriding reasons for processing - this does not apply to objections to direct marketing). to exercise your above right, please contact us at the contact addresses provided above.

further use of data and deletion
further processing or use of your personal data will generally only take place if permitted by law or if you have consented to the data processing or use. in the event of further processing for purposes other than those for which the data was originally collected, we will inform you of these other purposes prior to further processing and provide you with the further relevant information.
