privacy policy
version date: july 13, 2020
thank you for your interest in inpixon, our products, company and people. as a user, partner, client or customer, we want you to understand how we collect, use and disclose personal information through our websites and business activities and your choices regarding the use of your personal information.
this privacy policy informs you about our privacy practices when, for the purposes of the general data protection regulation 2016/679 ( “gdpr”) and other laws globally, inpixon (“inpixon”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is acting controller and the sole owner of personal information. this includes when you interact with us in the following ways:
you visit the inpixon family of websites including inpixon.com, jibestream.com, localitysystems.com, and shoom.com, and any other websites, social media pages, mobile apps (where linked to this privacy policy) (the “sites”);
you receive communications from us, including invitations, resources, materials, emails, phone calls or texts about our products;
you register for, attend or take part in our events, webinars or contests; and
you purchase and use any of the inpixon family of products and services that have been deployed by one of our business customers, such as your employer (“services”).
this notice does not cover any personal information we may process on behalf of our customers when they use our indoor positioning analytics products (the “ipa products”). in general, inpixon’s customers use the ipa products to collect and analyse information regarding the presence of devices within a venue, which includes information about those devices such as mac address and relative signal strength in order to infer the distance of the device in relation to sensors within the venue (the “customer data”). these sensors collect customer data by passively listening for radio frequency (rf) signals including wifi, bluetooth, cellular, or ultra-wide band (uwb) depending on the specific ipa product.
with respect to the ipa products, inpixon acts as a “data processor,” as that term is defined under gdpr, because inpixon’s customers, not inpixon, control collection of customer data based on determinations regarding the implementation and use of the ipa products on their network. inpixon acts at the direction of its customers with regard to the processing of customer data and does not access customer data except to provide the services, address technical issues, make use of such data in an aggregated and anonymous format, and otherwise to the extent required by law. all other use of customer data is by customer’s designated administrative staff who have been provided access to the ipa products. for more information about the use of ipa products within a venue and their processing activities, please consult the privacy policy of the customer utilizing the ipa products. this policy may change from time to time in response to changing legal, technical and business developments. the most recent version of this policy is reflected by the version date located at the top of this policy. if we make material changes to this policy, we will take appropriate measures to inform you in a manner that is consistent with the significance of the changes we make and is in accordance with applicable law.
