privacy policy
tellabs respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. this privacy policy explains how tellabs treats your information, correspondence, and software exchanged through a tellabs website to best serve you.
information tellabs requests or collects from you
to provide the superior services offered by a tellabs website, tellabs collects from you two types of information: personally identifiable information and technology-related information.
personally identifiable information:
this is information that identifies the person who is using a tellabs website. when you register for services offered by a tellabs website, tellabs may request personally identifiable information such as your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address. when you make an on-line business transaction through a tellabs website, tellabs may request personally identifiable information such as your account number with tellabs, credit card number or other payment account information. tellabs may also collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily disclose to tellabs through electronic correspondence, such as comments transmitted by email.
technology-related information:
this is information related to your computer when you access a tellabs website. because technology is employed in collecting this information, it is not readily apparent to you that it is being collected. an example of technology-related information which tellabs may collect is your computer’s internet protocol (“ip”) address. an ip address is a number, uniquely identifying a computer, necessary for computer to web server communication on the internet.
how you can view and change your personally identifiable information
in using the tellabs enterprise portal service, you can view and update your personally identifiable information by accessing the “my profile” hotlink, under the “my account” area in the global navigation bar.
in using other services offered by a tellabs website, you can update your personally identifiable information by re-registering with the service with a comment instructing tellabs to update your personally identifiable information or by requesting an update using the contact us form.
services offered by a tellabs website which require requesting information from you
tellabs requests information primarily to provide you with superior service. tellabs may need information about you in order to provide specific services, such as the following:
product notifications:
tellabs may use your submitted personally identifiable information to provide to you product notifications, at your request.
business transactions:
tellabs may use your submitted personally identifiable information, purchase-related information and related correspondence to conduct an on-line business transaction, at your request. for example, tellabs may also use your information to transmit to you business data such as order status, shipment status, account information and products returned.

tellabs secondary uses of information collected from you
tellabs may use information collected from you for secondary uses, such as the following:
measure user interest in tellabs products and services:
tellabs may perform statistical analyses on aggregate user demographics and behavior to measure interest in the different areas of a tellabs website or the various products or services offered by a tellabs website. to obtain statistics, tellabs collects your clickstream (the record of your traversal through a tellabs website).
site improvement:
upon accessing a tellabs website, tellabs collects information, such as the browser you are using and the screen size you are using, to improve the content of the site, make your traversal through the site more efficient and tailor the content and layout of the site to your preferences.
administration:
tellabs collects your computer’s ip address for the purposes of administration, such as monitoring the level of activity on a tellabs website and diagnosing problems with tellabs web servers.

url prior to accessing a tellabs website:
to enforce the tellabs linking policy, tellabs will collect the uniform resource locator, or “url,” which is the address of the web site you last visited prior to accessing a tellabs website.
cookies:
in a very limited manner, tellabs uses cookies (small pieces of information tellabs web servers transmit to your computer) to allow tellabs web servers make your traversal through a tellabs website more efficient. for instance, tellabs may use cookies to remember items selected for purchase in an on-line business transaction in order to generate a total charge for the entire transaction. you may set a preference in your web browser to warn you every time a cookie is being sent or to turn off all cookies. (please refer to the help page in your web browser to set up your cookie preferences.)
surveys:
tellabs may use your personally identifiable information to send you surveys regarding use of a tellabs website and tellabs various products and services.

tellabs may share your personally identifiable information if you authorize tellabs to do so.
agents of tellabs:
tellabs may share your personally identifiable information, purchase-related information, training requests and correspondence with customer service with third parties who help tellabs deliver products or services, such as a shipping company. those third parties include contractors, temporary employees and consultants and other companies working with tellabs (collectively, “agents”). agents are instructed to use your information to help tellabs deliver products or services.
companies of tellabs:

business partners:
tellabs may disclose aggregate user statistics of purchase-related information, training requests and technology-related information to prospective and current business partners and advertisers. this information will not include personally identifiable information.
business transfers:
as tellabs continues to develop its business, tellabs may sell or buy companies or assets. in such transactions, personally identifiable information generally is one of the transferred business assets. in addition, aggregate user statistics of purchase-related information, training requests and technology-related information may be disclosed to a prospective purchaser of a tellabs company or asset. although unlikely, tellabs or substantially all of its assets may be acquired. in this instance, personally identifiable information will be one of the transferred assets.
protection:
tellabs may disclose your personally identifiable information and technology-related information, when tellabs believes that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply the terms and conditions of the use of the tellabs web sites and other agreements or to protect the rights, property, or safety of tellabs, users or others.
law enforcement:
tellabs may be required by law to cooperate with government authorities and will, for example, disclose your personally identifiable information and technology-related information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena.
