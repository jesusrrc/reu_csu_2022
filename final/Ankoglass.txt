before you access or use any of our services we encourage you to read the entire privacy policy. a short summary is below:

you have the right to request the deletion of your personal information and any information you have uploaded at any time and for any reason by contacting: legal@glass.photo.

we do not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes.
we do not share your contact information without your consent.
any personally identifiable information that you provide will be secured with industry standard protocols and technology.
we will collect the bare minimum information and store for only so long as we need it to provide you with the app.
1. please read the whole policy
this privacy policy governs glass’s information management policies including how glass gathers, stores or shares your information, if at all. notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this privacy policy does not apply to information that is gathered or collected offline. by using the app and by submitting information to glass, you agree to the practices described in this privacy policy and to any other applicable terms, including the terms. this privacy policy is intended to provide you with a clear explanation of how, when and why we collect and use your personal information, as well as an explanation of your legal rights. nothing in this policy is intended to override the terms of any contract you have with us or any rights you have under applicable data privacy laws.
please read the entire policy and make sure you fully understand our practices before using our services. if you do not agree with our practices you must immediately leave the app. if you have any questions after fully reading the policy, please contact us at: legal@glass.photo.
from time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services or we might change or extend the list of partners that we use to store and process personal data.  if the introduction of services results in any material changes in the way we collect or process your information we will provide you with more information and update this policy.
2. what information is collected?
we collect two types of information from visitors and users. the first, unidentified and non-identifiable information (“anonymous information”) does not enable glass to identify the visitor or user from whom it was collected. the anonymous information collected by glass may consist of the date, time, length and non-precise location of your visit. glass will not aggregate, use or share anonymous information with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.
the second type of information we collect is individually identifiable information, meaning information that can identify an individual or may, with reasonable efforts, lead to the identification of an individual (“pii”).  pii collected by glass consists of contact details provided by users when creating a user account (“user account”) (e-mail address, full name, profile picture and description), correspondence through the app, and any other pii provided directly by users and visitors to glass.  a third-party payment processor collects and processes financial information on our behalf; we do not collect or retain your payment information. if any anonymous information is linked to pii, it is treated as pii as long as the connection exists.
you may review, amend or delete any and all information associated with your user account by signing into your account on the app. you may also request the deactivation of your user account and any uploaded content by sending an e-mail to legal@glass.photo.
3. how is information collected?
glass collects information about you only if we have a reason for such collection, such as to provide you with a user account, to communicate with you, or to improve our app. information is collected in three ways:
(a) information collected automatically through accessing the app. when you visit the app (or any website), your actions while your browse the app or access any links, directly through the app or may be tracked. we do not use cookies.
(b) information you provide glass. when you contact us directly, provide information for a user account, or register for our email newsletter, we collect the pii you provide us.  we may also store all communications you have directly with us (support tickets, emails).
(c) information obtained from outside sources. you can learn more about these practices in section 7 below.
4. why is information collected and when is it shared?
we use the information we collect (both anonymous information and pii) to operate and improve the app.
we do not share your pii with outside parties except to the extent necessary to operate our app, such as to process credit card information. we use revenuecat and apple to authenticate who you are and your payment information. please click through for their privacy policies.
in the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. in such transactions, anonymous information and pii may be among the transferred assets.
glass will not sell, license, rent, or otherwise disclose your pii except as stated herein, unless under the following circumstances: (1) you have affirmatively given your consent; (2) we previously notified you of the disclosure in this privacy policy or when you provided your information on the app; (3) we are compelled by law, legal process, or court order to disclose; (4) disclosure is required to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may cause harm to, or interference with, glass’s rights or property, our users, or anyone else; or (5) to respond to an inquiry, request or complaint that you have made. glass may cooperate with internet service providers to identify users whenever required to comply with law, to enforce compliance with this privacy policy or our terms, or to protect the app, our customers and others.
5. where is information stored?
glass is working with state of the art partners to establish and protect their data storage facilities. the companies we are working with to make this possible are: amazon aws.
glass uses industry standard technologies to safeguard your data (both anonymous data and pii) from unauthorized use and disclosure and to prohibit possible security breaches of the app. unfortunately, no website, application, computer system or online communication is completely secure. glass cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. your use of the app is at your own risk.
glass will take commercially reasonable steps to use heightened security technologies to protect the transmission and storage of transactional information to the app. such heightened security measures may include the secure transmission and encryption of all supplied sensitive financial or other transaction-related information. glass does not handle any such information directly but uses apple’s secure system. check out apple’s privacy policy here.
unless otherwise specified, whenever you make a payment, your financial and other transaction-related information will only be used to process your transaction and will not be stored on our servers or used for marketing purposes.
data will be maintained, processed and stored by glass in the united states of america or other jurisdictions, as necessary, for proper delivery of the services or as required by law. pii is kept only as long as necessary to provide you with access to the app and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining your account, and making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings.
6. requesting deletion of information and your rights
upon written request glass will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your pii. you may access, correct, or request deletion of your pii by emailing: legal@glass.photo. we will respond to your request within a timeframe imposed by local laws or a reasonable timeframe.
please note that permanently deleting your glass user account erases all of your information from our system. after completing this process your user account and all its data will be removed permanently, and glass will not be able to restore your user account or retrieve your data in the future.
