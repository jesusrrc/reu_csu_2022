how does ni use cookies and similar technologies?
the ni website uses ni and service provider "cookies" and similar technologies to enable you to sign in to our services, to help personalize your online experience, to analyze trends and to track users’ activities on the website. we use cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the same information repeatedly.
a cookie is a piece of text that is placed on your computer's hard drive. depending on the settings you have selected, your browser adds the text to your device as a small file. many browsers are set to accept cookies by default. you have the ability to accept or decline cookies as you prefer. the help portion of your web browser, most likely found on the toolbar, typically tells you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
to learn more about cookies, how we use them on www.ni.com, and how you can view or delete them, refer to our cookies help page at https://www.ni.com/help/cookies.htm.  if you choose to decline cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some areas of our website will be limited.

we also use scripts, pixels and similar technology, that help us manage content on our site. for example, we may use scripts to personalize your experience to show you products that support your industry.  we may also use these technologies to identify the most popular locations on our site, to help us make more of our pages valuable to our customers and to troubleshoot any issues our customers raise about our site’s operation.
targeted display advertising
we may use third-party advertising companies to use cookies, and internet browsing to help us display personalized content and appropriate advertising during your visits to ni.com and other websites. for example, if you view a product on the ni website, you may see offers for similar products on other websites you visit. cookies placed by these advertising companies also assist us with measuring the performance of our advertising campaigns and with identifying the pages you view, the links and ads you click on, other actions you take on those web pages, and the site from which you came before arriving at a web page. these cookies can be effective whether you are on ni.com or another website. if you opt out of receiving targeted display advertising, the data associated with these cookies will not be used.

if you do not wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out of publishers’ content by visiting https://preferences-mgr.truste.com (or if located in the european union click https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). please note this does not opt you out of being served all advertising. you will continue to receive generic ads.
“do not track” signals
please note that while you may have the opportunity to opt-out of targeted advertising through the link above and you may be able to control the use of cookies through your web browser as described in the “how does ni use cookies and similar technologies” section above, some web browsers may also give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting. this setting sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing. this “do not track” signal is different from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies. ni does not respond to web browser “do not track” signals at this time. if we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this privacy statement. for more information about “do not track,” visit www.allaboutdnt.org.
how does ni secure my personal information?
the security of your personal information is important to us. we follow generally accepted standards to protect your personal information from misuse, interference and loss, as well as from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.  the ways we do this include:

using encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive information, such as credit card details;
limiting physical access to our premises;
limiting access to the information we collect about you;
ensuring that we and our business partners have appropriate security safeguards to keep personal information secure; and
where required by law, destroying or de-identifying personal information.

no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  we encourage you to keep any passwords you use confidential and to be careful to avoid “phishing” scams where someone may send you an email that appears to be from ni asking for your personal information.  ni will not request your id or password through email.

when you see either a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your browser window, your connection with our site including transfer of sensitive payment information you may enter, is secured through secure sockets layer (ssl). if you do not see one of these icons, please contact ni to complete your transaction over the phone.
children's personal information
ni takes children’s privacy seriously. we do not knowingly collect personal information from children through our website. if you are a child as understood by laws of your country, please do not submit any personal information through our website.
social media features
our site includes social media features, such as the facebook and linkedin buttons. these features may collect your ip address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it.
ni community features
public member directory and community profiles
if you create a community profile on our website, we will list limited information about you in our publicly accessible member directory. you may change your privacy settings or make updates to your community profile by logging into your community account.  if you wish to request removal of your information from our directory or to have your community profile deleted, please contact community@ni.com.

testimonials
we display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements. with your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. if you wish to update or delete your testimonial, please contact us at privacy@ni.com.

use of ni public forums
any information (including personal information) that you choose to disclose in public areas of our website, such as the alliance partner program, ni discussion forums, chat rooms, forums, message boards, or other public forums such as trade shows or conventions, becomes public information that others may collect, circulate, and use. any text you include in a message is public. because ni cannot and does not control the acts of others, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose information about yourself or others in public forums such as these. to request removal of a posting you have made or your personal information from our blog or community forum, please complete the site feedback form on www.ni.com or contact privacy@ni.com.  in some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know the reason we are unable to do so.
links to third-party websites and services
third parties control the content of all third-party websites that are linked to our website.  these links are provided as a benefit to you. if you submit personal information to any third-party website through one of those links,  the personal information you provide is governed by the third-parties’ privacy statements. we encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any site you visit.
notification of privacy statement changes
we may update this privacy statement at any time to reflect changes to our information practices. if we make any material changes, we will notify those with user accounts by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or post a notice on this site prior to the change becoming effective. all updated versions of this privacy statement will include an updated posted effective date.  we encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
