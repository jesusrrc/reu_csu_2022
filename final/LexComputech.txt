privacy policy
valid as of march 2020
at  lex computech  ( lex system ) , we are committed to handling your personal information with care and responsibility, while also upholding all relevant data protection laws.
this policy statement outlines how  lex computech  ( lex system )  collects, uses, and shares personal information about anyone – including customers, clients, business partners, suppliers, and representatives of organizations – with whom  lex computech  ( lex system )  has, or is considering entering into, a business relationship.


the collection of your personal information
personal information is almost always collected through direct communication such as a company survey. we also regularly gather information about individuals when they register for or take part in a company event.

the personal information of people living within the eu will be collected in accordance with eu privacy legislation, and this may affect your rights – see the your rights section below.

we might collect your personal information for a number of different reasons, which include:

website and online service ease of use
when you visit  lex computech  ( lex system )  website or use an associated online service, information such as your user name, password, ip address, and personal browser settings will be gathered to ensure you have access to relevant information and services, and also to allow us to operate our websites and comply with relevant legal requirements. additionally, to personalize your website experience, information about the way in which you use  lex computech  ( lex system )  websites, such as your preferences and settings, will be recorded. this data will help us improve our products and services.

our ability to contact existing and prospective clients, partners, and suppliers, and their staff
in order to deliver products and services, provide support, manage contracts, and invoice customers, we collect business contact information for existing and prospective clients, partners, and suppliers. this information might include the names, titles/positions, and contact details of staff members, advisors, contractors, and authorized users.

efficient handling of orders and response to requests for information or support
whenever you contact lex computech (lex system), whether online or otherwise, to order products or services or to ask for information or support, we will record the information we need to fulfill your order or answer your enquiry. this information might include your name, contact details, a summary of your request or any agreement you have entered into with us, details about the fulfillment of any request or delivery and invoicing of any order, and any information gathered from a client satisfaction survey. this information will be kept for administrative purposes, to help us serve you better in the future, and to defend our rights.

documenting visitors
we record the names and contact details of people who visit  lex computech  ( lex system )  company premises. due to safety, security, and regulatory considerations, security cameras are also in operation at company locations.



cookies
lex computech  ( lex system )  uses “cookies” to collect information when you visit company websites. this information is used to give us an insight into website usage and effectiveness, improve our products and services, and to personalize your online experience.

a “cookie” can be defined as a piece of data that a website sends to your browser and that may then be stored on your computer as a hardware identifier. cookies are most commonly used to assess website usage – visitor numbers, length of visit – and effectiveness – pages and topics visitors are most interested in – and also to make website navigation easier. used in this way, cookies have no real connection to personal information. however, cookies are sometimes used to track user preferences in order to personalize and improve user experience.

cookies can be broken down into two groups: "session cookies” and "persistent cookies.” session cookies aid efficiency and are erased when the user closes their web browser. they track the things users do from page to page, meaning that people are not repeatedly asked for the same information. persistent cookies are stored on a user’s hard disk and will not be deleted when a web browser is closed. they are used to record information about things like preferred language and user location.
when you visit an  lex computech  ( lex system )  website or use an associated online service, you may be able to set your own cookie preferences via your web browser tools and settings. although changing your cookie preferences will not cause cookies already stored on your device to be deleted, you can use your web browser settings to delete cookies.

lex computech  ( lex system )  websites do not recognize "do not track" instructions and other automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, but in most cases, you can still use your web browser to define your own privacy settings regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies. to do this, click on "tools" – alternative headings may be used in different browsers – and look for information on cookies. it’s generally possible to turn off cookies or set up a notification so that your browser warns you before you receive a cookie. if you do this, you’ll be able to decide whether you want to accept individual cookies.

we recommend that you leave your cookies turned on as they make it possible for you to take full advantage of some of our websites' features. if you turn off, block, or otherwise reject our cookies, some web pages may not load properly.



how we use your personal information
any personal information we collect will be collated and may be analyzed for marketing purposes. if you want to receive information about  lex computech  ( lex system )  products and services, you can choose to do so via email, telephone, or post, and you can also sign up for a subscription. you will be able to choose not to have your personal information used in this way. you may also choose, at any time, to unsubscribe from marketing updates by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the marketing emails you receive, by informing us of your decision during a marketing call, or by contacting us directly.

if, in our communications with you, we state that we have used your personal information in conjunction with a request, order, transaction, or agreement, we will have used the information because it was necessary for the fulfillment of the request, order, transaction, or agreement.

if we state that we have used your personal information in conjunction with a marketing project or for the development of  lex computech  ( lex system )  products and services for safety, security, or regulatory considerations and not for any reasons connected to an agreement or request, we will have used the information either with your consent or to uphold the legitimate interests of  lex computech  ( lex system )  or a third party.
