how we transfer personal data across international borders
unisys is a global enterprise based in the united states with operations in countries around the world. authorized unisys personnel and third parties acting on our behalf may access, use and process personal data collected from you in a country that is different from the country where you entered the personal data, which may have less stringent data protection laws.
as an it and security services company, unisys has implemented global privacy practices for processing personal data protected under various data protection laws. unisys transfers personal data between the countries in which we operate in accordance with the standards and conditions of applicable data privacy laws, including standards and conditions related to security and processing and acceptable transfer mechanisms.
on july 16, 2020 the court of justice of the european union invalidated the adequacy finding for the eu-u.s. privacy shield. on september 8, 2020 the swiss federal data protection and information commissioner followed suit, issuing an opinion paper stating the swiss-u.s. privacy shield did not provide an adequate level of protection for data transfer from switzerland to the u.s.
for transfers of data from the eu, unisys relies on standard contractual clauses approved by the eu commission and verifies the adequacy of personal data protection in the recipient country.
while the privacy shield framework may no longer be relied upon, unisys has self-certified and will continue to comply with the eu-u.s. and swiss-u.s. privacy shield frameworks. unisys will continue to be subject to federal trade commission enforcement and investigatory powers and regulation by the department of commerce until such time as a privacy shield replacement is enacted for eu-u.s. data transfers. in compliance with the privacy shield principles, unisys commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. eu and swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our privacy shield policy should first contact unisys as provided for below under “how to contact us.”
under certain circumstances, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration. in accordance with privacy shield, unisys has further committed to refer unresolved privacy shield complaints to jams privacy shield dispute resolution, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the [united states]. if you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please visit file an e.u.-u.s. privacy shield or safe harbor claim jams for more information or to file a complaint. the services of jams are provided at no cost to you.
