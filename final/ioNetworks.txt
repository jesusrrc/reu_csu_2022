legal basis for processing personal information (eea visitors only)
if you are a visitor from the european economic area (“eea”), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
however, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. in some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
if we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our sites and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interests, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our sites, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities. we may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
if you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “contact us” heading below.
storage and security of your personal information
we use technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. the measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.
where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our sites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. we ask you not to share your password with anyone.
you should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure, accurate, complete, or current.  please note that information collected by third parties may not have the same security protections as information you submit to us, and we are not responsible for protecting the security of such information.

we and third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to enable certain features and functionality of our sites and to provide you with content that is customized to your interests. our sites may also collect information as described in this notice, including identifiers designed to enable advertising on your mobile device or other internet connected device. some tracking technologies used on our sites may be implemented and controlled by third-party partners.

additional nielsen terms (applicable outside the eea only)
the sites that enable you to view a+e networks’ video content feature proprietary measurement software from the nielsen company (“nielsen”) which will allow you to contribute to market research, like nielsen’s tv ratings. the information is collected directly by nielsen’s software within the applicable site. neither a+e networks nor nielsen makes any representations or warranties to you regarding the nielsen software. the nielsen software is licensed solely for your use within the applicable site, and nielsen reserves all intellectual property rights and goodwill associated with such software. the nielsen software also contains third-party software that remains the property of its respective owners.
to learn more about nielsen’s digital measurement products and your choices in regard to them, please visit nielsen’s digital measurement privacy policy page at nielsen.com/digitalprivacy for more information. once there, you can access more detailed information about the measurement software and learn about your choices with regard to nielsen’s measurement. in the “choices” section of the digital measurement privacy policy page, you will have the opportunity to receive an opt-out cookie if you do not want to participate in nielsen’s online measurement.
international data transfers
your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. these countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
specifically, our website servers are located in the usa, and our group companies and third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. this means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.
however, we have taken safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this notice. these include implementing an intra-group data transfer agreement incorporating the european commission’s standard contractual clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the eea in accordance with european union data protection law. a copy of our intra-group data transfer agreement can be provided upon request.
where required by applicable data protection law, we have implemented similar safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.
data retention
we retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
when we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
your data protection rights (eea visitors only)
if you are a resident of the eea, subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information.
specifically, you may be able to make the following choices:
access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “contact us” heading below.
