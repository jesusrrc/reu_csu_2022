onward transfer of personal data
to facilitate our global operations, and in accordance with applicable laws, we may transfer your personal data to, and access your personal data from, our offices, subsidiaries, affiliates and service providers in the various countries in which we or they operate (including the united states of america). this may be to a country other than the one in which it was provided or collected. when we transfer your personal data, we do so in compliance with applicable data protection laws. we take steps to protect personal data in whatever country it is stored in, transferred to or accessed from. you may request additional information, including in respect of transfer mechanisms by exercising your rights as set out below.
where samsara is unable to rely on an adequacy decision for the purposes of the gdpr, we rely on other transfer mechanisms. for example, to comply with applicable data protection laws around international data transfer mechanisms from the european union or the united kingdom to the united states, we have entered into european commission approved standard contractual clauses (“sccs”) and routinely review whether and which additional safeguards to offer to provide adequate protection.

security
we are committed to keeping personal data secure, and we have implemented contractual, technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against its unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. such measures have been implemented taking into account the state of the art of the technology, their cost of implementation, the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the personal data. when we provide your personal data to third parties, including service providers, we require those companies to protect the personal data they receive and not to use the personal data for any purpose other than providing the required services.
nevertheless, although we have tried to make our products and services secure and reliable, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from us cannot be guaranteed. we therefore urge you to exercise caution when conveying any personal data over the internet. as when disclosing any information on the internet, you should remain mindful that such information might be accessible by the public and, consequently, may be collected and used by others without your consent. you should also recognize that your use of the internet and any other means of communication with us is solely at your own risk.
third party websites and features
as a convenience to you, samsara may provide links from our websites, products and/or services to other websites maintained by independent third parties. we are not responsible for the privacy practices of independent third parties. we encourage you to be aware of when you leave this website, and to read the privacy policies of any other websites that you may visit.
some web browsers transmit “do-not-track” signals to websites. because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. we currently do not take action in response to these signals.
how long do we store your data?
personal data is maintained on our servers or those of our service providers and is accessible by authorized employees, representatives, agents, and service providers who require access for the purposes described herein. we will retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected or to comply with legal, regulatory or internal policy requirements. to determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
our policy toward minors
our website, products and services are not directed to minors under 16 and we do not knowingly collect personal data from minors. if we learn that we have collected personal data of a minor under 16 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.
data protection rights, and how to exercise
you may have a right to access and to obtain a copy of your personal data as processed by samsara. if you believe that any personal data we hold about you is incorrect or incomplete, you may also request the correction of it.

samsara will honor such requests for access, correction, deletion or restriction and/or any withdrawal or objection as required under the applicable data protection laws and regulations (including the gdpr). however, please note that such rights are not absolute: they do not always apply, and exemptions may be applicable (e.g., such exemptions noted in ccpa §1798.105 or in chapter iii of the eu gdpr). samsara may, in response to any such request, ask you to verify your identity and/or provide information that helps us to better understand your request. if we do not comply with your request, we will explain why.
you may exercise any of your rights in this section without discrimination by us. we will not deny you products or services, charge different prices or rates, or provide a different level or quality of products or services based on your exercise of any rights in this section, unless the difference is reasonably related to the value provided by your data.
to exercise the above rights with samsara, you may send an email to privacy@samsara.com. you can also raise any concerns by contacting our data protection officer at dpo@samsara.com.
if you are not satisfied with our response, you have the right to make a complaint to the data protection authority in the jurisdiction where you live or work, or in the place where you think an issue in relation to your data has arisen. the contact details of each data protection authority in the eu can be found at the following website: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm. you may contact us if you require assistance finding contact information for data protection authorities outside of the eu.
as highlighted above: if you are personnel of a customer that uses samsara products or services, otherwise have had your personal data collected via samsara products or services by or on behalf of our customers, please note this privacy policy does not apply to such personal data. please therefore refer to such applicable party who has ordered samsara products or services if you wish to exercise your rights.
