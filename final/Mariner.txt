collection, use and disclosure of personal information
this site collects personal information about you that is provided through various forms and in various places on the site, including by entering it via an online form, over the phone, and by any other means through which you interact with our services. personal information includes information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, or is capable of being associated with a particular consumer or household and may include information such as your name, address, telephone number, mobile number, email address, and social security number.
you are responsible for ensuring that any personal information you provide is truthful, accurate and up-to-date. we will collect and store personal information you decide to provide to us for our records, but we are not liable to you if the information you provide is not accurate. you agree that we may use any of your personal information that you provide to us to communicate with you. additionally, if you apply for a loan on the site, you must truthfully and accurately complete our online application, which includes your provision of personal information. accurate, up-to-date information is necessary to view your credit history, process your application, and to contact you.
mariner takes various precautions to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. for example, all online applications are encrypted to maintain the security of your information. once received, your personal information is stored in the united states in accordance with united states law.
as permitted by law, mariner may disclose all categories of personal information that it has collected to third parties in accordance with our privacy notice (located at the bottom of this page), as needed to assist in administering our services and marketing activities, as required by law, as necessary to protect our rights (such as if you fail to repay a loan), as necessary in order to detect, investigate, prevent, or take action against illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or personal safety of any person, as required to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us, and/or as specifically consented to by you.
if mariner were to merge with or be acquired by another company or if it were to cease operations, your information may be transferred to the surviving or acquiring company. at that point, any use and sharing of your information will be subject to that company’s privacy policy, which may be different from that of mariner. in addition to this privacy statement and mariner’s website terms of use, our use of your personal information collected is described in the privacy notice.
third parties may also collect personal information about your online activities through the site in order to assist mariner in offering its services and products, marketing, and administration of the same. additionally, we may disclose your personal information for a business purpose to a third party with whom we have entered into a contract that describes such a purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.
collection, use and disclosure of other information
the site may gather other information about you depending on how your browser is configured. that information may include the internet protocol (ip) address(es) used to access the site, the number of times you visit the site, the time and length of the visit, the operating system and browser type used to access the site, your screen resolution, the particular web pages viewed right before and while visiting the site, how long you remain on specific pages, your navigation patterns, where you go upon leaving the site, or similar details.
the site may use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as clear gifs, web beacons, log files, and the like) to track unique visitors and pages viewed by users, both to understand how the site is being used and to improve users’ experiences on the site. for example, cookies (small, unique text files that a website can deposit on your computer hard drive when you visit a website) may be used to allow repeat visitors to be served more quickly and efficiently or to provide information on the pages viewed by a given user. since cookies reside on a user’s hard drive, they may be deleted by a user after they are deposited by a site. you may also configure your browser to reject cookies, although if you do, some or all of the features on the site may not be available to you.
non-personal information collected as a result of your visit to the site may be disclosed to third parties, but will not be associated with you personally. in other words, the site may disclose that a unique user accessed the site a particular number of times and spent specific amounts of time on different pages, but we will not disclose the identity of that user (and most likely would have no way of identifying who that user was unless the user voluntarily identified him or herself to us).
some web browsers have a “do not track” function that allows you to tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. the site does not monitor or respond to “do not track” signals or similar mechanisms.
we use google analytics, a web analytics service provided by google, inc. google analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with the site, compile reports on their activity, and provide other services related to their activity and usage. the technologies used by google may collect information such as your ip address, time of visit, whether you are a returning visitor, and any referring website. the technologies used by google analytics do not gather information that personally identifies you. the information generated by google analytics will be transmitted to and stored by google and will be subject to google’s privacy policies. to learn more about google’s partner services and to learn how to opt-out of tracking of analytics by google, click here.
the site also uses a third-party analytics provider, fullstory, to enable us to monitor and improve the user experience. fullstory uses cookies and similar technologies to collect information, such as ip address, referring url, device information (e.g., operating system), and information on user behavior (e.g., pages visited, links clicked, information entered, and mouse movements). for further details, please see fullstory’s privacy policy available here. to opt out, fullstory provides this link.
security
to prevent unauthorized access to your personal data, maintain data accuracy and integrity, and ensure the correct use of information, mariner follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

we do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is manifestly unfounded or excessive, for example, because of a repetitive nature. if we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

what is a personal loan?
great question. it’s a loan that may help you deal with an unexpected expense, see a new part of the world, or simply help you achieve your personal goals. we have those.
learn more about personal loans
†we offer personal loans from $1,000 to $25,000, with loans terms from 12 to 60 months. minimum and maximum amounts dependent on an applicant’s state of residence and the underwriting of the loan. loans between $1,500 and $15,000 may be funded online. loans greater than $15,000 or less than $1,500 are funded through our branch network. specific interest rates and fees are determined as permitted under applicable state law and depend upon loan amount, term, and the applicant’s ability to meet our credit criteria, including, but not limited to, credit history, income, debt payment obligations, and other factors such as availability of collateral. not all rates and loan amounts are available in all states. additional fees may apply to some loan offers; some state required and/or permitted fees may be treated as prepaid finance charges. any such charges shall be in addition to the loan amount requested and/or approved and shall be fully disclosed to the applicant on his/her loan agreement. not all applicants will qualify for the lowest rates or larger loan amounts, which may require a first lien on a motor vehicle not more than ten years old titled in the applicant’s name with valid insurance. our loan by phone and online closing process requires a compatible mobile or computer device on which you can access your email and electronic documents. not all loan types are eligible for loan by phone or online loan closing.
to help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. as a result, under our customer identification program, we must ask for your name, street address, mailing address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. we may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.
for any stated annual percentage rate (“apr”), the apr represents the cost of credit as a yearly rate and will be determined based upon an applicant’s credit at the time of application, subject to state law limits.  a range of apr’s may be applicable, subject to state law limits and individual underwriting. not all applicants will qualify for a lower rate. apr’s are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle, and the lowest rates typically apply to the most creditworthy borrowers. all terms and conditions of a loan offer, including the apr, will be disclosed during the application process. as an example, with an amount financed of $5,000.00 the borrower receives $5,000.00 at an apr of 29.99% and an interest rate of 28.77% which includes a finance charge of $3,640.96. under these terms, the borrower would make 48 monthly payments of $180.02, for a total of payments of $8,640.96. the amount financed may not be the net proceeds paid if charges other than interest are included in the loan.
*the process uses a “soft” credit inquiry to determine whether a loan offer is available, which does not impact your credit score. if you continue with the application process online and accept a loan offer, or are referred to a branch and continue your application there, we will pull your credit report and credit score again using a “hard” credit inquiry. this “hard” credit inquiry may impact your credit score.
