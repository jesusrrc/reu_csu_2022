how to contact us
personal data infor collects
infor collects data from you through our interactions with you and through our products. the data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with infor and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. you provide some data to us directly (e.g., contact information, job information) such as through inforum events or managing your communication preferences, we collect data about your interactions with and use of our products (e.g., cookies or other electronic trackers, customer relationship management information), and we obtain data about you from third parties (e.g., information from an infor partner or information about your attendance at an event sponsored by infor).
when you interact with us, we collect information sent to us by your device. the information we collect may include data about the pages you access, your computer ip address, device id or unique identifier, device type, geolocation information, computer and connection information, and mobile network information.
you have choices about the technology you use and the data you share with us. when we ask you to provide personal data, you may decline. however, many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. if you choose not to provide that necessary data, you will not be able to use that product or feature. similarly, where we need personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, we will not be able to proceed if you do not provide the data. we will let you know if not providing the personal data will result in our inability to provide you with a product or service. in cases where providing personal data is optional, certain features like personalization will not work if you choose not to provide the personal data.
applicants’ personal data
our website also provides for the functionality to apply for a position in infor in countries where infor has a subsidiary, a local branch, or a representative office.
if you are applying for a job with either infor or one of its customers, we collect additional information related to your employment application.
processing of your personal data when you apply directly to infor
where you apply for a position at infor, we will process the following personal data of yours: your email address, first and last name, and any other information relevant to the application.
for job applicants applying directly to infor, we use the personal data you have provided to make employment decisions, as well as for our other legitimate business purposes, such as workforce analysis, gaining a greater understanding of our applicants, attracting talented individuals, and providing you with information about job vacancies at infor. we also use your data to comply with our legal obligations, such as applicable immigration or employment laws.
processing of your personal data when you apply to an infor customer using infor’s talent science software
for job applicants using infor’s talent science software to apply to an infor customer (who acts as a controller of your personal data), we share your personal data and our assessment with infor’s customer to whom you are applying (or for whom you already work). our assessment uses the information you provide to help our customers develop their workforce.
at our customer’s or your request, we may disclose your personal data to third parties for employment screening, background checks, credential verification services, or other similar services related to verifying the accuracy of the information you have provided (to the extent they are permitted by the applicable law). if you do not want your personal data, (including test results or background checks) used as described here, you should not provide us with your personal data. not providing the personal data will preclude you from proceeding with your talent science application.
we draw your attention that when you use infor’s talent science to apply to our customer, such customer will act as an independent controller of your personal data, while we will be processing such data on a basis of the customer’s processing instruction (as a data processor). please see the privacy policy of the company to which you apply for relevant information on how your data will be processed. for more details in this regard, please also read “products provided by your organization” and “personal data processed by infor on behalf of its customers” sections of this policy.
how infor uses personal data
infor uses the data we collect about you to provide you with rewarding, interactive experiences. in particular, we use data to:
provide our products and services, such as this website and other tools, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. it also includes sharing data, when necessary to provide the service or other transaction you have requested.
respond to your inquiries, where you reach out to us as an actual or a prospective client or a partner.
communications for events when you provide your personal data such as your name and contact details when registering for an event.
improve and develop our products.
personalize our products.
advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications and targeting advertising.
manage your marketing preferences.
we also use the data for our business purposes, including analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, and developing our workforce. to achieve these purposes, we sometimes combine data we collect from different contexts to give you a better experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate reasons. for example, we may combine information we have about your current engagement with our products with information relating to your other interactions with infor, including your attendance at infor sponsored events. we may also combine data in other contexts to the extent permitted by the applicable laws.
legal bases for the processing of your personal data
in all cases where we process your personal data in our capacity of a data controller, we make our best efforts to ensure that we have an appropriate legal basis for doing so. in particular, we will process your personal data in the following cases:
in case you provide your explicit consent for the processing of your personal data;
in case we need to process your personal data for the performance of a contract between you and infor, such as the terms of use;
in case processing of your personal data is required to us for the performance of our legal obligations imposed on infor by virtue of the applicable laws;
if we need to process your personal data to preserve our or a third party’s legitimate interest, in which case we will make sure that such processing does not entail violation of your rights and freedoms;
in case we will process your depersonalized data for statistical or other research purposes.
where we process your personal data under instruction of our customer or any other third-party (data controller), we rely on such instruction as a basis for the processing of your personal data, while such third parties remain responsible to ensure primary legal bases for such processing similar to those described below.
reasons we share personal data
we share your personal data with infor affiliates and subsidiaries, vendors, partners, and service providers (when you have approved such sharing) to complete transactions, or to provide a product you have requested. we also share data with infor affiliates and subsidiaries, with vendors working for us, when required by law or legal process, to protect lives, to maintain the security of our products, to provide support services and to protect the rights and property of infor and its customers. for example, we may share information with our partners to complete a business transaction with you or to provide support during your use of our products and services.
please contact us as explained below in “how to contact us” section with any questions.
your personal data rights
you have choices about how infor collects and uses your data. you can exercise your data protection rights by contacting infor or by clicking here. we will respond to you within the time limits established by applicable law.
namely, you have the following rights in connection with processing of your personal data performed by infor, subject to applicable law:

correct the information we hold about you;
erase your personal information;
restrict our use of your personal information;
object to our use of your personal information;
withdraw your consent for us to use your personal information, if applicable;
receive your personal information in a usable electronic format and transmit it to a third party (right to data portability); and
lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority
personal data processing for direct marketing purposes
you may control the use of your data for advertising from infor by visiting our preference center. not all personal data processed by infor may be accessed or controlled using the preferences page. if you want to access or control personal data processed by infor that is not available using the tools located on the preferences page, you can contact infor at the address listed below. we will obtain consent when processing your personal data to send direct marketing communications, when required by law, and you will be able to revoke your consent (e.g., unsubscribe).
international transfers of data
infor is a global organization with its headquarters in the united states. we may share your personal data among infor, our affiliates, our service providers, and other third parties that may be outside the country in which you reside. certain countries, where we transfer your personal data may not provide a level of data subjects’ rights protection adequate to same in your country of residence. we have put in place appropriate safeguards to handle the transfers of data to ensure that your personal data is handled as described in this policy.
where we are required to do so by the applicable laws, we ensure that before transferring your personal data outside your country of residence we comply with the requirements of applicable laws.
infor complies with the eu-u.s. privacy shield framework and the swiss-u.s. privacy shield framework (privacy shield) as set forth by the u.s. department of commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the european union, the united kingdom and/or switzerland to the united states in reliance on privacy shield. infor (us) has certified to the department of commerce that it adheres to the privacy shield principles with respect to such information. if there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the privacy shield principles, the privacy shield principles shall govern. to learn more about the privacy shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/list. the federal trade commission has jurisdiction over infor’s compliance with privacy shield. in certain situations, infor may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
as a result of the decision of the court of justice of the european union in case c-311/18 (“schrems ii”) on july 16, 2020, the privacy shield framework is no longer suitable as a mechanism to ensure the lawfulness of transfers of personal data from the eu, uk and switzerland to the us. we maintain adherence to this framework as required to maintain our privacy shield certification, and particularly with regard to personal data already transferred from the eu, uk or switzerland to the us. we continue to ensure the lawful transfer of personal data from the eu, uk and switzerland to the us through alternative mechanisms such as the standard contractual clauses, as approved by the european commission. standard contractual clauses were not invalidated by the decision of the court of justice of the european union as a lawful transfer mechanism. we are monitoring the situation as it develops and will update this information with any amendments needed to remain compliant.
if you have an unresolved privacy or data security concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. under certain conditions, an individual may invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding privacy shield compliance not resolved by any of the other privacy shield mechanisms: https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=annex-i-introduction.
infor has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the privacy shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. infor shall remain liable under the principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the principles, unless infor proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
infor’s privacy practices, described in this privacy policy, also comply with the apec cross border privacy rules system. the apec cbpr system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating apec economies. more information about the apec framework can be found here.
