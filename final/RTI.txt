collection of data from individuals’ located outside the united states
rti is headquartered in the united states of america. if you are located outside the united states and provide your data to rti, we will take proper steps to ensure that your information is protected in accordance with this policy.  rti recognizes that the european union has established a data protection policy effective may 25th, 2018 known as general data protection regulation (“gdpr”). this regulation applies to countries within the european union (“eu”) and governs the transfer of data outside of the eu.  gdpr restrict companies in the eu from transferring personal data about individuals to the united states, unless there is “adequate protection” for such personal data when it is received in the united states. to create such “adequate protection” and allow our vendors to overcome the restriction on international data transfers established by gdpr by adopting standard contractual clauses.  transfers of data can also occur when rti has your consent or the transfer is necessary for rti to perform requirements under a contract that you have entered into with rti.  rti has implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures so that the use of your personal data meets the requirements of the gdpr.
under gdpr, individuals located in the eu/eea are allowed the following protections with respect to your personal data:
the right to access – you have the right to request rti for copies of your personal data. we may charge you a small fee for this service.
the right to rectification – you have the right to request that rti correct any information you believe is inaccurate. you also have the right to request rti international to complete the information you believe is incomplete.
the right to erasure – you have the right to request that rti erase your personal data, under certain conditions.
the right to restrict processing – you have the right to request that restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.
the right to object to processing – you have the right to object to rti’s processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.
the right to data portability – you have the right to request that rti transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.
if you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. if you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at our email: privacy@rti.org
or write to us:
global privacy officerrti internationalp.o. box 12194research triangle park, nc 27709
furthermore, if you are located in the united kingdom (“uk”), there are two main data protection laws that apply to the processing of personal information: the “uk data protection act of 2018” and the “united kingdom general data protection act” or “uk gdpr.”  the uk data protection act adopted the requirements of the eu gdpr. the uk data protection act applies to data collection and processing activities within the uk while the uk gdpr applies to data collection and processing activities outside the uk.  you have the same individual rights regarding your personal information as above.
