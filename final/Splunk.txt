updated: december 2021
this privacy policy explains how splunk inc. and its subsidiaries ("splunk") collect, use, and disclose information you provide to us or which we otherwise collect (“information”), including “personal data” by which we mean information that allows us to determine your identity.
this privacy policy applies to splunk.com and to other websites splunk operates that link to this privacy policy. from time to time, splunk acquires companies that may operate under their own privacy policies. you will continue to be presented with those companies’ privacy policies on their websites until the integration with splunk is complete and those websites are linked to this privacy policy.
the use of our products and services, including those available through other splunk websites that link to this privacy policy (collectively, “offerings”), are subject to the terms of the applicable customer agreement. the use of our website is subject to the splunk websites terms and conditions of use. the terms of this privacy policy are incorporated into and form part of those agreements.

data collection
there are two primary ways in which splunk collects information about you: through interactions and through offerings as set forth below.
interactions
when you interact online or offline with splunk, we may receive your information, including your personal data. for example, we receive your information when you:
visit splunk’s websites or offices
download materials through our websites
provide or update account information through our websites
register for or attend splunk-hosted or sponsored events (such as promotional events, webcasts, contests, or hackathons)
participate in community programs and splunk-managed repositories on third-party open-source platforms
communicate with us including by emails, phone, texts, and online chats
provide testimonials
we collect information about you from other sources such as public databases, commercial data sources, joint marketing partners, resellers, managed services providers and other partners, social media platforms, and conference/event hosts.
we refer collectively to these contacts as “interactions” and we explain below how we use the information we collect through them.
what we collect via your interactions
we (or others acting on our behalf) may collect your information, including your personal data, through interactions. the personal data we collect includes such things as:
name or alias
email address
physical address, including country
employer
title / position
payment details
phone number
username / user id
ip address
mac address (or other device identifiers automatically assigned to your device when you access the internet)
images and related metadata (for example, when visiting our offices or attending an event)
content of your communications and files you input, upload, or create
videos (for example, when you provide a product testimonial)
we collect personal data in various ways, such as when you manually key in your personal data to our website forms or provide it to us or others from whom we receive marketing leads. from time to time, we offer virtual private networks (vpns) for attendees at splunk events or visitors to our offices. if you access a splunk-provided vpn, we may collect personal data from you, such as ip and mac addresses, when we monitor the vpns for security or performance.
ip addresses are also collected on an automated basis through your use of the website services using cookies, web beacons, and like technologies. we may infer your location from your ip address. for more on the use of cookies and like technologies, see the splunk cookie policy and how we use information collected from interactions.
when you make purchases through our website, we use third-party payment processors to collect credit card or other financial information. splunk does not store the credit card information you provide, only confirmation that payment was made.
how we use information collected from interactions
splunk uses the information we collect from your interactions to deliver services to you in accordance with our terms, to fulfill our contractual and legal obligations, or to “pursue legitimate business interests”, as described below. we take seriously the need to balance our legitimate interests with your privacy rights. we summarize for you here how we use your information, including personal data, to:
fulfill your orders or respond to your requests for information and other inquiriesfor example, to satisfy your requests for website materials such as marketing collateral or white papers, we collect and use your name and email address.

what we collect via our offerings and how we use it
we collect and process different types of product data (described below) when you deploy our offerings in order to fulfill our contractual and legal obligations and operate our business or fulfill other legitimate interests. we work hard to help ensure a balance between our legitimate interests and your privacy rights.

security offerings data. certain security-focused offerings collect and in some cases allow sharing of customer-submitted “artifacts” (such as logs, alerts, emails, cases, and incidents) and intelligence sources to support security investigation, threat detection and monitoring. in some cases, this information may contain names, ip addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and other types of personal data contained in such artifacts and intelligence sources. you determine the extent and nature of the data you submit and whether to participate in such offerings and in some cases to share the data with splunk. participation in these services is voluntary and is further described in the relevant terms and documentation.
certain splunk offerings rely on automated methods of processing, such as artificial intelligence, which is a set of technologies and processes that allow computers to learn, reason, and assist in decision making. these technologies may consume usage data or other data you submit to the offering that may be associated with you. the use of data in connection with such offerings is set forth in the relevant terms.
for more information about the data collected through our offerings, see the offering-specific documentation (e.g., share data in splunk enterprise in the splunk enterprise admin manual).
