your privacy matters to garmin
our goal is to make sure you know how we collect, use, share, and store your personal data when you create a garmin account, interact with our customer support specialists, and visit garmin.com or other garmin websites and apps covered by this privacy policy.
what data does garmin collect?
we ask for personal data — such as your name, email address, location, and other information — so you can sign in to your account, receive personalized support, receive important safety information about your devices, and get the most out of our products.
when you make a garmin account
garmin stores information such as your name, email address, and password so you can sign in, and it helps us verify your account if you call customer support.
when you buy products or subscriptions
when you buy products or subscriptions from garmin, we ask for information such as your name, address, and phone number so we can get your order processed and shipped to you.
we have third parties verify your address and process your payment information, but garmin does not store your payment card details. we only use this information to help us fulfill your orders.
when you sync products
when you sync your device, we collect data such as your ip address, sync time and date, and battery level to help identify and resolve errors or syncing issues and to provide better customer support.
when you contact garmin
we know you want to stay off the grid, but we may collect things such as your contact and device information during support calls to ensure that you get the help you need.
when you use location features
sometimes we need to collect your device’s location. that makes it a lot easier to tell you about things such as weather in your area, nearby traffic, and even movie prices near you.

with your consent, garmin collects information that includes location, direction, and speed to help with features such as parking and traffic.
why does garmin ask for your personal data?
from providing product support to offering clear directions to your destination, any information we ask you for is used to improve your experience with garmin.
to keep you informed
when we have something important to tell you about your products, apps, subscriptions, or account — such as vital safety information, app updates, new products or deals, and updates to our privacy policy — we use collected contact information to reach you.
to improve our sites and apps
when you visit our sites or use our apps, we collect information — such as your ip address, location, times that you visit, and more — to let us know how people navigate our sites and apps and how we can improve them.
to give you information you might actually find interesting
we use things such as cookies, pixel tags, and similar tools to help us provide better, more relevant content on our sites. so if you and everyone else are coming to garmin.com for awesome fitness devices, we’ll know to keep making them.
we also use these tools to see how effective our ads are and to identify any problems that we need to fix. all in all, we just want to give you websites worth browsing.

no! we don’t sell your personal data to anyone. and we only share your personal data with others in specific situations.

data shared for legal reasons
garmin will share your personal data when required to by law enforcement and in other legal matters.
data shared with content and feature providers
with your consent, we share information collected from your auto navigation device — such as location, direction, and speed — with third parties that provide content and features such as traffic and parking information.
how can you share your personal data?
