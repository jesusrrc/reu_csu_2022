information we obtain from third-party sources

who does belden share my personal information with?
we may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:
to our group companies, third party services providers and partners who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our website, conduct surveys, provide technical support, and process payments), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this privacy notice or notified to you when we collect your personal information. a list of our current group companies is available in belden inc.’s most recent annual report on form 10-k, filed with the united states securities and exchange commission and available here.

basis for processing personal information
although the sections above describe our primary purpose in collecting and using your personal information, in many situations we have more than one purpose.  for example, if you complete an online purchase we may collect your information to perform our contract with you, but we also collect your information as we have a legitimate interest in maintaining your information after your transaction is complete so that we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your order.  as a result, our collection and processing of your information is based in different contexts upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law, and/or our legitimate interest in conducting our business.

how do we keep your personal information secure?
no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. while we use reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. in the event that we are required by law to inform you of a breach to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.

international data transfers
your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. these countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.

specifically, certain website assets and our corporate headquarters are located in the united states, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. this means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries. by submitting your personal information to us you agree to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in a country other than your country of residence including, but not necessarily limited to, the united states.

however, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this privacy notice. belden has implemented an appropriate data transfer agreement utilizing standard contractual clauses among belden and its subsidiaries, and is in the process of initiating binding corporate rules program.

data retention
typically, we retain personal information we collect from you for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements), unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. more detailed information on belden’s data retention programs may be provided upon receipt of an appropriate request.

automated decision-making
in some instances, our use of your personal information may result in automated decisions being taken that legally affect you or similarly significantly affect you.

automated decisions mean that a decision concerning you is made automatically on the basis of a computer determination (using software algorithms), without human review. for example, we may use automated decisions to screen résumés. if such automated decision making procedures are implemented, we will take appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and interests of individuals whose personal information is subject to automated decision-making.

when we make an automated decision about you, you have the right to contest the decision, to express your point of view, and to require a human review of the decision. you can exercise this right by contacting us.

children & privacy
we do not knowingly collect information from or about children age 13 and under.

your data protection rights & choices
depending on your country or state of residence, you may have certain of the following data protection rights
if you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us in a manner consistent with our data subject access rights policy (“dsar policy”). if required by law, upon request, we will grant you reasonable access to the personal information that we have about you, or grant your request to delete such information. you should note that in many situations we must keep your personal information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or for another one of our business purposes. in addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. again, you can exercise these rights in a manner consistent with our dsar policy.
you have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. you can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe,” “opt-out,” or similar link in the marketing e-mails we send you. to opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), please contact us in a manner consistent with our dsar policy.
similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. in some cases, we may limit or deny your request to revoke consent if the law permits or requires us to do so, or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity.
if you are in the european union, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. for more information, please contact your local data protection authority. (contact details for data protection authorities in the european economic area, switzerland and certain non-european countries (including the us and canada) are available here.)
we respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with our data subject access rights policy and applicable data protection laws.

our data subject access rights policy and more detailed information on how to submit a request may be found here.

information for california residents
california civil code sections 1798.115(c), 1798.130(a)(5)(c), 1798.130(c), and 1798.140 indicate that organizations should disclose whether certain categories of personal  information are collected, “sold” or transferred for an organization’s “business purpose”(as those terms are defined under california law).  you can find a list of the categories of information that we collect and share here. please note that because this list is comprehensive it may refer to types of information that we collect and share about people other than yourself. if you would like more information concerning the categories of personal information (if any) we share with third parties or affiliates for those parties to use for direct marketing, you can submit a request using the contact details provided under the “how to contact us” heading below.  we do not discriminate against california residents who exercise any of their rights described in this privacy notice.

modifications to our privacy notice
belden reserves the right to change our privacy notice at any time, except as may be prohibited by law. we will post revisions online and note the effective date of the latest version at the bottom of the privacy notice. to the extent that our policy changes in a material way, the privacy notice that was in place at the time that you submitted personal information to us will generally govern that information unless we receive your consent to the new privacy notice.

privacy shield provisions
from the period shortly after its inception through april 1, 2021, belden participated in both the eu-us and swiss-us privacy shield programs. in 2020, the privacy shield program was invalidated by european data protection authorities as a mechanism through which the transfer of data to the united states is permitted. as a result, belden elected not to renew its certifications on april 1, 2021. we are actively monitoring developments in this area as u.s. and european regulators attempt to devise a satisfactory replacement framework and belden will look forward to a new cooperative data sharing framework in the future. even though belden inc. and its subsidiaries are no longer a part of the eu-us and swiss-us privacy shield programs, we remain committed to the principles enshrined in each program. we have always taken, and we will continue to take, the privacy of our associates, partners and other stakeholders very seriously and will continue to take appropriate steps to protect your personal information.

as disclosed above, belden may share personal data with third parties that provide certain services to belden, including but not limited to, outside accountants and lawyers, consultants and service providers. prior to transferring personal data within the belden group, belden will ensure that the protection and transfer of such personal data complies with appropriate data protection and privacy principles.

belden may transfer personal data to a third party acting as an agent for belden by having the third party enter into an agreement with belden in which the third party promises to provide appropriate safeguards regarding the protection of your personal data. if the third party agent does not comply with its privacy obligations, belden will take commercially reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure of personal data. belden acknowledges that it remains potentially liable under the privacy shield principles for the actions of its agents.


belden may also transfer personal data to a third party without your consent in response to requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, including, for example, if we are required to do so by law, regulation, subpoena, court order or any other government, judicial or regulatory process.
