segmenting audiences: our advertising partner uses data from elixir’s digital properties to segment visitors into groups (e.g. high vs. low intent visitors) for reporting, analytics and determining the ads and email content that would be of most interest to you.
ad delivery: our advertising partner uses technical information (e.g. browser and device data) to deliver ads and verify that they have been successfully delivered.
frequency capping: our advertising partner may cap the frequency of ad delivery to ensure you do  not receive the same ad too many times.
sequencing: our advertising partner may use data to deliver ads in a specific sequence to ensure you see them in the correct order.
mapping data to our advertising partner’s cross-device asset: our advertising partner uses cross-device assets to match devices with a single person, household, and/or online identifiers (e.g. hashed email addresses) that you have provided to elixir. this cross-device asset allows our advertising partner to gain a better understanding of your online activity and to improve our ability to deliver relevant ads and evaluate ad campaigns. you may opt-out of cross-device interest-based targeting by employing the respective opt-out techniques we describe in your choices and opting-out of interest-based advertising and analytics (see below).
identifying companies associated with an ip range for b2b marketing: our advertising partner uses ip address ranges disclosed by companies to analyze and report website traffic.

5. aggregated and de-identified data
our advertising partner may aggregate and de-identify the data they collect to ensure it cannot be associated with a natural person, either wholly or in part. they use de-identified, aggregated data to conduct advertising analysis and for reporting purposes.
