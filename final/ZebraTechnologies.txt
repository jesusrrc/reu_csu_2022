how zebra uses personal information
zebra uses, discloses, transfers, and otherwise processes data, including personal information, in several ways. zebra uses the data it collects for three basic purposes: (1) to process transactions for the sale and support of zebra products and/or services, (2) to operate zebra’s business, and to provide and support the products and services zebra offers (including improving and personalizing), and (3) to send certain communications, including promotional communications. when customers place an order, zebra uses the personal information provided, including any payment information necessary to provide the products or services requested.  if you create a user profile, zebra will store personal information as requested to manage the profile and communicate with the user.  without limiting our obligations under our privacy shield policy, if you are located outside of the united states, please be aware that any information you provide to zebra through the sites may be transferred to the united states.  please also be aware that by using the sites and giving zebra your information, you consent to such transfer. you also understand that the u.s. may not provide the same level of protections as the laws of your country.
personal information may also, subject to the requirements of applicable law, be used, disclosed and transferred to law enforcement personnel and other persons in situations where zebra believes that it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal proceedings against someone who may be misusing the sites, interfering with the rights of zebra or other users, or when zebra reasonably believes that the law requires or permits such disclosure.

why zebra shares personal information
zebra shares personal information with consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product or service requested or authorized. zebra also may disclose and transfer personal information to channel partners, strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties for the purposes described in this privacy statement and to assist with the operation of the sites and/or the associated business transactions.  if zebra sells or divests all or part of its business, makes a transfer of assets, or otherwise becomes involved in a change of control transaction, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, zebra may transfer personal data covered by this privacy shield policy to one or more third parties as part of the transaction including the due diligence process.
additionally, zebra will access, transfer, disclose, and preserve personal information when zebra has a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:
comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;
protect our customers, for example to prevent unsolicited emails or attempts to defraud users of zebra products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone;
