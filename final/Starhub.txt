starhub aims to comply with the requirements of the pdpa and respects your choices. if you have registered your telephone number with the dnc registry, we will not send you our promotional and marketing messages via phone calls, text messages and faxes. however, if you have previously given us consent to contact you for such purposes, we will continue to do so until you withdraw your consent.
if you would like to ensure that you will be kept informed of the starhub’s latest rewards, promotions and benefits via your telephone, you can opt in to receive such messages through our personal data protection portal.
what is do not call (dnc)?
the dnc is a registry under the personal data protection act (pdpa) containing a number of obligations that apply in relation to people sending marketing messages to singapore telephone numbers via voice calls, sms/mms or fax.
generally, before an organization sends a marketing message to a singapore telephone number, they must check with the do no call registry to confirm that the number is not listed on a do not call registry, unless they have obtained clear and unambiguous consent from the subscriber of the number. for more information, please visit the personal data protection commission’s website.
what types of messages are affected by the dnc provisions?
a message whose purpose, or one of its purposes, is to advertise, promote or offer to supply goods or services, land, business opportunity etc… are considered as marketing messages and are included in the dnc provisions.
informational and service-related messages will not be affected.
how long does it take to stop receiving marketing messages once i register in the national dnc?
it takes 60 days for your registration with the national dnc registry to take effect and you may still receive marketing message while your registration is being processed. starting from 2 jul 2014, it will take 21 days.
can starhub send me marketing messages even though i have registered with the national do not call (dnc) registry?
starhub will send you marketing messages if you have given us consent or you have an ongoing relationship with us. if you would like to continue receiving updates of marketing promotions from starhub, you may register your consent at our personal data protection portal, which will take 21 days to come into effect.
your status will remain valid until you change it at our personal data protection portal or terminate your number with starhub.
