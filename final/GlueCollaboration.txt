purposes
there are several purposes of the processing of your personal data by glue:
to provide you the service
glue processes your personal data to be able to make the service available to you and to the entity you are representing.
if you contact our customer service, we will use the information provided by you to answer your questions or solve your complaint.
for our legal obligations
glue processes data to enable us to administer and fulfil our obligations under the law. this includes data processed for complying with our bookkeeping obligations and providing information to relevant authorities such as tax authorities.
for claims handling and legal processes
glue may process personal data in relation to claims handling, debt collection and legal processes pertaining to the data subject or the company the data subject represents. we may also process data for the prevention of fraud, misuse of our service and for data, system and network security.
for general communication and marketing
glue processes your personal data to contact you regarding the service and to inform you of changes relating to it. your personal data is also used for the purposes of marketing the service to the company you are representing.
for quality improvement and trend analysis
we may also process information about your use of our website and the service to improve their quality e.g. by analysing any trends in their use. in order to ensure that our website and the service are in line with your needs, personal data can be used for things like customer satisfaction surveys. when possible, we will do this using only aggregated, non-personally identifiable data.
legal grounds for processing
glue processes your personal data primarily to pursue our legitimate interest to run, maintain and develop our business and to create and maintain customer and other business relationships. when choosing to use your data on the basis of our legitimate interests, we weigh our own interests against your right to privacy and e.g. provide you with easy to use opt-out from our marketing communications and use pseudonymised or non-personally identifiable data when possible.
we may also process your personal data in order to comply with legal obligations.
in some parts of the service, you may be requested to grant your consent for the processing of personal data. in this event, you may withdraw your consent at any time.
3. transfers to countries outside europe
we process personal data primarily within the european economic area. however, we have service providers in several geographical locations. as such, we and our service providers may transfer your personal data to, or access it in, jurisdictions outside the european economic area.
we will take steps to ensure that the users’ personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which they are processed. we provide adequate protection for the transfers of personal data to countries outside of the european economic area through a series of agreements with our service providers based on the standard contractual clauses or through other appropriate safeguards, such as the privacy shield framework.
more information regarding the transfers of personal data may be obtained by contacting us on any of the addresses indicated above.
4. recipients
we only share your personal data within our organisation if and as far as reasonably necessary for the purposes of this privacy policy.
we do not share your personal data with third parties outside of glue’s organisation unless one of the following circumstances applies:
for the purposes set out in this privacy policy and to authorised service providers
to the extent that third parties need access to user data in order for us to provide the service, we provide such third parties with your data (such as our authentication service partners). furthermore, we may provide your personal data to our affiliates or to authorised service providers who perform services for us (including accounting, payment, hosting and advertising partners).
when your personal data is processed by third parties as data processors on behalf of glue, glue has taken the appropriate contractual and organisational measures to ensure that your data is processed exclusively for the purposes specified in this privacy policy and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and subject to our instructions and appropriate obligations of confidentiality and security measures.
for legal reasons and legal processes
we may share your personal data with third parties outside our organisation if we have a good-faith belief that access to and use of the personal data is reasonably necessary to: (i) meet any applicable law, regulation, and/or court order; (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, crime, security or technical issues; and/or (iii) protect the interests, properties or safety of glue, the users or the public as far as in accordance with the law. when possible, we will inform you about such processing.
for other legitimate reasons
if glue is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we may transfer your personal data to the third party involved. however, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of all personal data. we will give notice to all the users concerned when the personal data is transferred or become subject to a different privacy policy.
with your explicit consent

5. storage period
glue does not store your personal data longer than is legally permitted and necessary for the purposes of this privacy policy. the storage period depends on the nature of the information and on the purposes of processing. the maximum period may therefore vary per use.
most personal data relating to a registered user will be deleted after a period of 12 months has lapsed after the user in question has terminated their registration with the service. thereafter, some of the personal data may be stored by us only as long as such processing is required by law or is reasonably necessary for our legal obligations or legitimate interests such as claims handling, bookkeeping, internal reporting and reconciliation purposes.
we will store analytics data of users that do not have an account with the service for a period of 12 months.
6. your rights

right to withdraw consent
in case the processing is based on a consent granted by the user, the user may withdraw the consent at any time. withdrawing a consent may lead to fewer possibilities to use our website and the service. the withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
right to rectify
you have the right to have incorrect or incomplete personal data we have stored about you corrected or completed by contacting us. you can correct or update some of your user data through your user account on the service.
right to erasure

we use administrative, organisational, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the personal data we collect and process. measures include for example, where appropriate, encryption, pseudonymisation, firewalls, secure facilities and access right systems. our security controls are designed to maintain an appropriate level of data confidentiality, integrity, availability, resilience and ability to restore the data. we regularly test our website and the service, systems, and other assets for security vulnerabilities.
should despite of the security measures, a security breach occur that is likely to have negative effects to the privacy of the users, we will inform the relevant users and other affected parties, as well as relevant authorities when required by applicable data protection laws, about the breach as soon as possible.
