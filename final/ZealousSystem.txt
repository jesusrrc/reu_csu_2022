2. where we store your personal data
we take the security of all data seriously. in line with the gdpr we have a responsibility to take all appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational steps to protect the data that you provide us with against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, misuse or unauthorized access.
we use google cloud for our data storage needs. accordingly, the data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the european economic area (eea). it may also be processed by staff operating outside the eea who work for us or for one of our suppliers. where any transfer is made to a country outside of the eea and the european commission has not made an adequacy decision in relation to the laws of that country we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place prior to any transfer of your data. those safeguards are likely to consist of either the use of standard data protection clauses adopted or approved by the european commission (also known as “eu model contract clauses” or mccs) or an equivalent regime. by submitting your information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. where any transfer is made to a country outside of the eea and the european commission has not made an adequacy decision in relation to the laws of that country we will ensure that the appropriate safeguards are in place prior to the transfer of your data.
zealous also makes use of a cms called activecampaign, allowing us to record all conversations had with you. this system is synchronized to reflect all the users of our services to allow us to respond to you quickly and keep a record of our conversations. this is supplemented by our email service provider (outlook) which stores all email conversations on the microsoft servers, as well as dropbox which may be used to keep information hosted on zealous about you for our projects, events, awards and more.
we may use other third-party service providers to enable us to run our business in an effective manner and to allow us to provide you with the best service. when we do so, we will ensure that the third party complies with the necessary data protection laws.
all information that you provide to us is stored on secure servers. where you have chosen a password which enables you to use certain parts or services of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. we ask you not to share a password with anyone.
unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
if there is a data breach we are under an obligation under the gdpr to report the breach within 72 hours to the relevant authority. you have the right to be promptly informed of a serious breach if it happens.
3. disclosure of your information
we may disclose your personal information to third parties:
we will be entitled to pass on information to third parties where it is necessary to administer the contract we have with you or where we have a legitimate interest in doing so.
we do not allow third parties to use your information for their own purposes and they will only process your information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instruction.
in the event that we sell or buy any business, assets or shares, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business, assets or shares;
if zealous solutions ltd or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets;
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of zealous solutions ltd, our customers, or others. this includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

if we disclose your personal data to our third-party service providers, we will provide them with express instructions when processing the personal data that you provide, and they must have in place appropriate technical and organizational security measures to safeguard such personal data.
we do not allow third parties to use your personal data for their own commercial purposes.

you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the information commissioner’s office (ico), the uk supervisory authority for data protection issues. we would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ico so please contact us in the first instance at [email protected].
under certain circumstances, by law, you have the right to:
a) request erasure of personal data, if there is no other lawful or legitimate reason for us to continuing holding it;

if you decide to exercise any of these rights, it may impact or prevent our ability to fulfil our obligation to provide you with the services.
if you want to exercise any of these rights please contact [email protected]
under the gdpr you have the right to request access to your personal data. you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights you have under the gdpr). however we may charge a reasonable sum of £10 if your request is considered unfounded, repetitive or excessive. alternatively, we may refuse your request in these circumstances.
in order to access your personal data we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your data (or to exercise any of the other rights). this is a security measure that we have implemented to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
we aim to respond to all reasonable requests within one month. if we think that it may take longer, due to a more complex request, we will keep you updated.
