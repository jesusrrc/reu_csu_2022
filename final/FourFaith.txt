what are cookies?
a cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. when you visit a website, that site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not generally store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.
