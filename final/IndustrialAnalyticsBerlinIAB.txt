“security of continuous supply is the highest priority for us. with the help of industrial analytics we can use the additional knowledge about our machines to flexibly schedule maintenance measures and save costs.”
tatiana van tilburg londoño, head of monitoring
“our goal is to secure our competitiveness with the help of innovative, digital services and to further extend our lead. the solution from industrial analytics increases operational reliability and transparency in the maintenance process.”
ekkehard körner, innovation manager
“for us, the potential of digitization is on the one hand the automation of work steps, but above all the preservation of (specialist) knowledge. industrial analytics supports us in system monitoring so we can optimize the production process and reduce our maintenance costs.”
frank stargardt, head of contractors
