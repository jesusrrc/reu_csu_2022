flexible diy robotics
plug&produce, easy-to-use & cost-efficient robotics for flexible automation in manufacturing
are you wondering how to take your business to the next level with robots?
you want to...
increase your overall productivity
reduce your production costs
make your production more flexible
make full use of your machines
but...
you have small lots and many variants
you don’t have a robot programmer
automation is too expensive
robots are not flexible enough
software: drag&bot os
graphical robot operating system
intuitive gui with graphical setting of parameters (=wizards), step-by-step guides and pre-build program templates
plug&play integration of gripper, cameras, feeders, integrated safety & more
independent expansion & retooling: with the worker cockpit, your employees can operate robots themselves
why drag&bot
managing directors, production managers and workers love drag&bot
managing directors rely on drag&bot, because they appreciate drag&bot for its efficiency and sustainability in industry

the new way of operating robots
integrated
a large number of interfaces to grippers, cameras and force-torque sensors allow you to select the right components for your application
graphical
the intuitive user interface enables all workers to implement robot applications quickly and independently without time-consuming training
flexible
with drag&bot you create robot programs 5x faster than with conventional operator interfaces and modify your robots in record time
drag&bot transforms industrial robots into flexible production tools
our software is the easiest way for flexible programming of robot systems. it enables your workers to use robots and other machines independently for automation.
what our customers and partners say
“with drag&bot we save a lot of time in our daily work with robots. we use this time for other challenges such as process development.”
“with drag&bot, our customers can teach-in new parts within a few minutes and thus reduce downtimes. this is a strong sales argument that sets us ahead of our competitors.“
“thanks to our partnership with drag&bot, we are able to offer an enhanced solution for the robotics market. the seamless integration of basler’s hardware and software into drag&bot opens up great opportunities. together, we enable both existing and new customers to upgrade their robot systems by using image processing in a cost-effective manner.”
“drag&bot makes the operation of our kuka iiwa incredibly easy – now we can integrate the robot much more easily into our lessons.”
“with drag&bot‘s intuitive user interface also non robot-experts can use our robots – this opens up a new customer segment for us.“
“in the age of digitalization, industrial robots are becoming increasingly flexible handling tools. thanks to the intuitive user interface of drag&bot, robots lose the horror of complicated programming for end users and can finally be used flexibly even by non-experts.”
“with the solution of drag&bot we enable our employees to program robots without programmring skills and as such to support the buildup of complex automation processes.”
“we are very impressed from your system, great handling and very expandable. it’s nice that you’ ve created it so openly that users can look into the function blocks.”
“we commissioned one of the epson vt6s for the production line with drag&bot. i’m amazed at how fast and easy it was.”
“i must say that your competitive advantage is clearly how easy it is to program robots in your platform using the modules – so well done for that! it is a good selling point. ”
