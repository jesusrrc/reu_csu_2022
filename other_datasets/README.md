# Other Datasets

This folder contains the datasets used to compare our own dataset. By the end of the project, this folder should contain up to two folders.
One folder should store the datasets in the CSV form, whereas the other folder stores the datasets in their original form, as some datasets
are not available as CSV files by default. Particularly, this folder includes these datasets:

* OPP-115 dataset (https://www.usableprivacy.org/data).
* Purpose-Extraction (Purext) dataset (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2021/5552501/).
* REU@CSU 2021 team's dataset.
* Carnegie Mellon University's dataset (https://sc.cs.cmu.edu/research-detail/73-usable-privacy-policy-project).

## Notes

* Based on our preliminary tests, the OPP-115 and REU@CSU 2021 datasets work as intended.
* The Purext dataset works as intended. However, this dataset contains various field for the several attributes.
* The Carnegie Mellon University's dataset is made of plaintext files. Thus, we imported these plaintext files into a single CSV files.
