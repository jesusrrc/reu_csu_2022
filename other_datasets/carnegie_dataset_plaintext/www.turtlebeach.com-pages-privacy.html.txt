This non-personal information is used to help us learn what products are of the most interest to users and to improve Site design and content. Some examples of non-personal information that we collect and use are:

SHARING YOUR INFORMATION THIRD PARTY PARTNERSHIPS.


On occasion, Turtle Beach may share personal information collected from the Site with selected third-party companies who assist Turtle Beach in providing products and services or in advertising, marketing and website analytics efforts or allow such third-party companies to collect personal information directly from the Site. Such information may include your name, address, email address and purchase information, which will help arrange product delivery, provide customer support or target marketing communications. Such third parties have agreed to keep such information confidential and not use it to send advertisements or other communications on behalf of anyone other than Turtle Beach and its affiliates.


Turtle Beach does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Turtle Beach or the third-party companies that assist us with marketing may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your personal information is not transferred to the third party.


CO-BRANDING.


Turtle Beach may enter into a co-branding relationship with another company or organization. At times, we may communicate with customers on behalf of that company and customers may be directed to a partner website to purchase a specific item or learn about their services.

LINKS TO THE SITE FROM THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES.


Turtle Beach may use outside marketing companies to place advertisements or links to the Site on third-party websites. The marketing company or the operator of such third-party website may collect information about people who click on an advertisement for or link to the Site.

DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.


We will not use or disclose your personal information except: (1) as described in this Privacy Policy; (2) after obtaining your permission to a specific use or disclosure; (3) if it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to Turtle Beach, or to others; (4) if we are required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process or governmental request (such as a court order, search warrant, subpoena, civil discovery request, or statutory requirement); or (5) as we otherwise believe is required by law.


Our Services Are Intended for Customers in the United States.


Turtle Beachs server is located in the United States. We, as U. S. based company, do not solicit or knowingly collect personal data from individuals located outside of the United States through the Site. If you are located outside the United States and choose to contact us and send us personal information voluntarily (e. g., by placing an order online via our Site), please be advised that your personal information will be processed in the United States and that the protection of your personal information in the United States may be different from data protection in the country where you reside. Where this occurs, you acknowledge and where required, consent to such transfer in accordance with this Privacy Policy.


You are also advised to consider before you voluntarily send personal information to us that there might not be an independent data protection authority and/or safeguards of the data processing principles and/or safeguards of data subject rights in the United States as set forth under your data protection law, unless such rights are explicitly mentioned in this Privacy Policy.


Text Marketing and notifications.


By entering your phone number in the checkout and initializing a purchase, subscribing via our subscription form, or a keyword, you agree that we may send you text notifications (for your order, including abandoned cart reminders) and text marketing offers. Text marketing messages will not exceed 30 a month. You acknowledge that consent is not a condition for any purchase.


If you wish to unsubscribe from receiving text marketing messages and notifications reply with STOP to any mobile message sent from us or use the unsubscribe link we provided you within any of our messages. You understand and agree that alternative methods of opting out, such as using alternative words or requests will not be accounted for as a reasonable means of opting out. Message and data rates may apply.


For any questions please text HELP to the number you received the messages from. You can also contact us for more information. If you wish to opt-out please follow the procedures above.


SECURITY OF OUR SITE.


We use encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of the information that you share with us. Once we receive your personal information via the Site, we do our best to protect its security on our systems. For example, we protect personal information we gather on a secured server that is located behind a firewall.


Unfortunately, however, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100 secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to or from the Site, and you do so at your own risk. Accordingly, we disclaim liability for any theft, loss, or interception of or any unauthorized access or damage to any data or communications. By using the Site, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.


Please keep in mind that if you disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through public forums and bulletin boards on the Site, this information may be collected and used by others. You are responsible for the personal information that you choose to share on the Sites public forums and bulletin boards.
