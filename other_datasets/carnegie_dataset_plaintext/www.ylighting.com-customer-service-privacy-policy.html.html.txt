Last updated: December 2019.


Welcome, and thank you for your interest in YDesign Group, LLC (YDesign, we, or us) and our web sites at {removed hyperref}, {removed hyperref}, {removed hyperref}, and {removed hyperref} (each a Site, altogether the Sites), as well as all related web sites, networks, embeddable widgets, downloadable software, mobile applications (including tablet applications), and other services provided by us, (collectively, together with the Sites, our Service). Protecting your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy (the Policy) describes the information that we gather from you on the Service, how we use and disclose that information, and the steps we take to protect that information. All of our Sites and related providers of the Service display a link to this Policy.


By using the Service, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy, including the use and collection of personal information as described in this Policy. Please read through this Policy carefully in its entirety and ensure you understand its terms. This Policy is incorporated into, made subject to and is governed by, our Sites Terms and Conditions (Terms).


HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION.


When you use the Service, we collect information about you to optimize your experience. This information falls into three general categories: information voluntarily provided by you, information we obtain when you use the Service, and information we collect through third parties.


INFORMATION YOU VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE:


When you interact with us, we collect information that you voluntarily provide to us. For example, you may give us your personally identifiable information (Personal Information), which includes, but is not limited to, Identifiers such as your name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number. We may collect the information you voluntarily provide when you communicate with us by phone, email, or other messaging features, interact with us or other users of the Service through any messaging features, including bulletin boards or chat rooms, or send us customer service-related requests.


INFORMATION WE GET WHEN YOU USE OUR SERVICE:


Personal Information.


We may also collect Personal Information when you use the Service, such as when you register for an account, place an order or make an inquiry by phone, post reviews or other materials, visit our store, place an order on the Service or otherwise contact us. The information we collect when you use -our Service includes, but is not limited to, the following:


{number list}.


{list item} Personal Information when you place an order on the Service, or enter an optional survey or contest, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address and phone number;


{list item} Commercial Information, such as billing address and financial information (credit card number and expiration date) if you choose to purchase products offered for sale on one of the Sites;


{list item} Your Geolocation data, such as your physical location while using the Service.


Usage Information.


When you use the Service, we collect information about your activity on the Sites and how you interact with the Service, such as your preferences as to products or purchases, browser type, domain names, number of page views, login frequency, page or section accesses.


System Information.


We collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Service, such as your IP address and unique device identifiers.


Information Collected By Cookies And Other Technologies:


Cookies:


When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookiessmall text files containing a string of alphanumeric charactersto your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Please review your web browser Help file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.


Automatically Collected Information.


When you use the Service, we may automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including clear gifs or web beacons. This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.


INFORMATION WE GET FROM THIRD PARTIES.


Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons.


We may also implement third-party content or advertising on the Service that may use clear gifs or other forms of web beacons, which allow the third-party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as the Pinterest Pin It button) that may allow third parties to collect information about you through those third parties browser cookies, even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, and YDesign Group does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third partys own data collection, use, and disclosure policies. Please see More Information about Advertising below to learn about how we work with third parties for our advertising.


Third Party Service Providers; Google Analytics.


We may work with different companies and third party service providers who offer services that can assist us in better understanding how users of our Service interact with and use our Service or otherwise assist us in providing the Service (Third Party Service Providers). We may permit such Third Party Service Providers to use certain technologies, including without limitation web beacons and cookies, to collect certain personal information or non-personally identifiable information in connection with the provision of such services to us. For example, we currently use and may continue to use a product called Google Analytics by permitting Google Inc. to use technologies such as web beacons and cookies to collect certain non-personally identifiable information that helps us understand your usage of our Service. We may permit Google and other third party analytics providers to combine information collected through our Service with information collected from third party services, and these analytics providers may use this information to help us better understand our users, and these analytics providers may also use this information to help their other customers better understand their users. Additionally, we currently use and may continue to use a version of Google Analytics called Google Analytics for Display Advertisers, which enables Google to collect, use, and disclose information in connection with certain advertising activities. You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads at {removed href} {removed hyperref}.


Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs).


We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a. k. a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied to Customers personally identifiable information. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. Also, clear gifs, which may be set by a third party, are used on pages to track sales, which may result from our Internet advertising campaigns and banner advertisements appearing on other web sites. In order to track the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, aggregate data pertaining to the dollar amount spent, items purchased, and campaign the customer responded to, is sent to third party servers for the purpose of tracking which sales resulted from specific advertising campaigns and to track conversion sales coming from banner advertisements. No individually identifiable data is sent to third party servers, only data that reflects that a sale occurred. If Customers would like to opt-out of these e-mails, they should see the Opt-out section.


Integrated Services.


You may be given the option to access, register for, or place an order on the Service through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an Integrated Service), such as through the use of your PayPal account credentials, or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide personal information or other information to us. By authorizing us to connect with an Integrated Service, you authorize us to access and store the information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Services terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service.


Information from Other Sources.


We may obtain information, including personal information, from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners, advertisers, and Integrated Services. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Policy.
