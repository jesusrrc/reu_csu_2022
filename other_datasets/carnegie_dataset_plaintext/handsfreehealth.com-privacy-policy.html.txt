Unless we delete your personal information as provided in this privacy policy, when we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing (except as may be necessary for us to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation) until deletion is possible.


6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?


IN SHORT: WE AIM TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH A SYSTEM OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND TECHNICAL SECURITY MEASURES.


We have implemented commercially reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we store or process. For example, we utilize Transport Layer Security (TLS) or similar encryption technology when sensitive data is transmitted over the Internet, and use firewalls to help prevent external access into our network. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that any data storage method or Internet connection is 100 secure. Although we try to protect your personal information, using or transmitting your personal information to or from any Product is at your own risk. You should only use the Products and transmit information to and from the Products within a secure environment.


We restrict access to personal information in our possession to our employees and service providers who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, improve or support our Products.

By using the Products, you represent that (i) you are at least, 18 or (ii) you are the parent or guardian of a minor that you are providing information about and consent to such minor dependents use of the Products. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected without the consent of a parent or guardian, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13 or believe that information from a minor has been collected without the consent or a parent or guardian, please contact us at {removed href} {removed hyperref}.


8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?


IN SHORT: YOU MAY REVIEW, CHANGE, OR TERMINATE YOUR ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME.


You may request access to your personal information by sending an email to {removed href} {removed hyperref}. We will try to locate and provide you with your personal information and give you the opportunity to correct this data, if it is inaccurate, or to delete it, at your request. But, in either case, we may need to retain it for legal reasons or for legitimate business purposes. You may also update or delete certain personal information from within the Products. However, we (and you) are not able to control information that you have already shared with other users or made available to third parties through the Products.


We ask users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected, or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backups), or relate to information that is not associated with your personal information. In any case, where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.


Please be aware that if you request us to delete your personal information, you may not be able to continue to use the Products. Also, even if you request that we delete your personal information, we may need to retain certain information for a limited period of time to satisfy our legal, audit and/or dispute resolution requirements.


You can opt out of receiving e-mails promoting our Products from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the e-mails. Please note that it may take up to ten (10) business days for your opt-out request to be processed. Also, even if you opt out of promotional e-mails, we may continue to send you certain account-related e-mails, such as notices about your account and confirmations of transactions you have requested.


We may use third-party service providers that collect information for interest-based advertising purposes (advertisements that are tailored to your likely interests, based on categories in which you have shown an interest). To learn more about these third parties and the choices they offer users, please visit the Network Advertising Initiatives choices {removed href} {removed hyperref}/ or the Digital Advertising Alliances choices {removed href} {removed hyperref}/. You can learn more about the DAAs mobile choices program {removed href} {removed hyperref}.


9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES.


Some web browsers include a Do- Not-Track (DNT) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to any mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked when using a Product. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.


10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?


IN SHORT: YES, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA, YOU ARE GRANTED SPECIFIC RIGHTS REGARDING ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. YES, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF NEVADA, YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.


You may have heard of the California Privacy Protection Act which provides certain rights to California (CCPA) residents in connection with their personal information. Our Products are not currently subject to the CCPA. However, we do provide notice and transparency about our collection and use of personal information as described in this privacy policy.


Additionally, California Civil Code Section 1798. 83, also known as the Shine The Light law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.


If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account for use with the Products, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post using the Products. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Products, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.


11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?


IN SHORT: YES, WE WILL UPDATE THIS POLICY AS NECESSARY TO STAY COMPLIANT WITH RELEVANT LAWS OR TO REFLECT CHANGES TO OUR OPERATIONS.


We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated Revised date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes on our website.
