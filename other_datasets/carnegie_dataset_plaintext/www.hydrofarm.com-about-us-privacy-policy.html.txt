Links and Third-Party Collection.


Hydrofarms sites contain links to other sites that are not owned, maintained, operated, or endorsed by or for Hydrofarm and not subject to the same privacy and other policies. The inclusion of any link to such sites does not imply any recommendation or sponsorship of such sites. You should read the other sites privacy policies to understand how personal information collected about you is used and protected. Hydrofarms sites also contain third party technologies that collect non-personally identifiable information from you directly. This includes third-party social media sharing buttons. These third parties might use passive tracking techniques such as cookies or web beacons to collect your information. Hydrofarm does not control these third parties. To learn more about their activities, please visit their websites and privacy policies.


Google.


We, along with third-party vendors such as Google, use first-party cookies such as the Google Analytics cookies.


California Online Privacy Protection Act.


CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The laws reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. See more at: {removed hyperref}.{removed hyperref}.

{number list}.

COPPA (Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act).


When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, which is the United States consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect childrens privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.


Fair Information Practices.


The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical in order to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.


In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:


{number list}.


{list item} We will notify you via email within 7 business days.


{list item} We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.


CAN-SPAM Act.


The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
