This privacy notice relates to our processing of your personal data where you are our customer or are a prospective customer (whether as an individual/ consumer or as an authorised representative of a business) or are a third party who interacts with us (including by visiting our website).


1. Who we are.


Optoma Europe Ltd (company number: 03399395) is the data controller and is responsible for your personal data (collectively referred to as Optoma Europe, we, us or our in this privacy notice).

You have the right to make a complaint at any time to a supervisory authority in Europe, in particular in a country where you live or work or where your legal rights have been infringed. In the UK, the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) is the supervisory authority for data protection issues ({removed hyperref}). You may also have the right to make a complaint to the supervisory authority within the appropriate EU member state. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the relevant supervisory authority so please contact us in the first instance.


CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY NOTICE AND YOUR DUTY TO INFORM US OF CHANGES.


We may change this privacy notice from time to time. Any changes we make to this privacy notice in the future will be posted on our website and, where appropriate, notified to you by email.


It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.


2. The data we collect about you.


Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).


We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you depending on the nature of products and/or services we are providing and what we are contracted to do for you or the business on whose behalf you are acting. We have grouped together the types of personal data as follows:


{number list}.


{list item} IDENTITY DATA includes first name, last name, username or similar identifier and title.


{list item} CONTACT DATA includes billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers.


{list item} FINANCIAL DATA includes bank account and payment card details.


{list item} TRANSACTION DATA includes details of products and/or services purchased from us.


{list item} TECHNICAL DATA includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access our website.


{list item} USAGE DATA includes information about how you use our website and our products and/or services.


{list item} MARKETING AND COMMUNICATIONS DATA includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.


We also collect, use and share AGGREGATED DATA such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does NOT directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.


We do not collect any SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.


The products and/or services which we provide together with our website are not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect any data relating to children. It is possible that we could receive information pertaining to children by the fraud or deception of a third party. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will, as required by law to do so, immediately obtain the appropriate parental consent to use that information or, if we are unable to obtain such parental consent, we will delete the information from our servers. If you would like to notify us of our receipt of information relating to a child, please do so by contacting us.


If you fail to provide personal data.


Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you or the business on whose behalf you are acting and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you or the relevant business (as the case may be). In this case, we may have to cancel such products and/or services but we will notify you or your business (as appropriate) if this is the case at the time.


3. How is your personal data collected?


We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:


{number list}.


{list item} DIRECT INTERACTIONS. You may give us your Identity and Contact Data by filling in forms on our website or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email, social media or otherwise. This includes personal data you provide when you:

{list item} request marketing to be sent to you; or.

{list item} THIRD PARTIES OR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SOURCES. We may receive personal data about you from various third parties and public sources. When we obtain information about you from third parties or publicly available sources rather than from you directly, we will notify you of any relevant information obtained, for example, the type of personal data, within a reasonable period.


Information collected from you about other people.


When you provide personal information to us which does not relate directly to you but is personal information of a third party (for example, details of other officers or employees where our customer is the business on whose behalf you are acting), you confirm that you are authorised to do so and shall ensure that this privacy notice is brought to the attention of such individuals at the earliest opportunity so that those individuals understand how their personal data will be used by us. We will hold and use such personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and data protection laws.


Third-party links.


Our website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit.


4. How we use your personal data.


We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:


{number list}.


{list item} Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.


{list item} Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.

See below to find out more about the types of lawful basis that we will rely on to process your personal data.


We do not use your information for automated decision making.


Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data except in those circumstances set out in the table below relating to sending direct marketing communications via email or as otherwise set out in this privacy notice. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by following the links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at {removed hyperref}.

If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at {removed hyperref}.


If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

5. Disclosures of your personal data.


We may have to share your personal data with selected people or organisations for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above. This will include, but is not limited to, sharing personal data with:


{number list}.


{list item} Other companies in the Optoma Group acting as joint controllers or processors and who are based in TAIWAN, FRANCE, GERMANY, NORWAY, THE NETHERLANDS, CZECH REPUBLIC AND SPAIN and provide sales and distribution services.


{list item} Service providers who provide IT and system administration services (including back-office support) and marketing platforms..


{list item} Selected third parties including business partners, independent contractors, advisers, accountants and insurers, where there is a legitimate reason for their receiving the information.


{list item} Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice. We may also disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation, or in order to enforce or apply any terms of our arrangement with you or the business on whose behalf you are acting.


We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.


6. International transfers.


We share your personal data within the Optoma Group. This may involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK). Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA or UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by implementing certain safeguards.


Please contact us if you want further information on the specific safeguards used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA or UK.


7. Data security.


We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.


Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.


We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.


8. Data retention.


We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.


To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.


Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy, which is available upon request by contacting us at {removed hyperref}.


In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure below for further information.


Furthermore, in some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.


9. Your legal rights.


Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to:


REQUEST ACCESS to your personal data (commonly known as a data subject access request). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.


REQUEST CORRECTION of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.


REQUEST ERASURE of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.


OBJECT TO PROCESSING of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.


REQUEST RESTRICTION OF PROCESSING of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the datas accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.


REQUEST THE TRANSFER of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.


WITHDRAW CONSENT AT ANY TIME where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.


If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at {removed hyperref}.


NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED.


You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.


WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU.


We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.


TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND.


We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
