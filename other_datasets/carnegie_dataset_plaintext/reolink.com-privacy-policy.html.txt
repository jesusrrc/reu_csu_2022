Last updated on Dec 13, 2019.


Your privacy is important to Reolink. Weve developed this Privacy Policy that covers what information we collect, how we collect it, how we use it and what choices you have about it.


Some of the concepts might seem a little technical, and weve tried our best to explain them in a simple and clear way. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and {removed href} let us know if you have any questions.


This Privacy Policy governs your use of Reolink official website {removed href} {removed hyperref}/, including Reolink subdomain sites around the world (collectively, Site), and it also applies to the security products we sell, the official software we offer (Reolink App and Client specifically), as well as all other services Reolink provides, including, but not limited to Reolink Cloud and technical support (collectively, Products and Services).


BY USING REOLINK SECURITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, YOU CONSENT TO THE DATA PRACTICES PRESCRIBED IN THIS STATEMENT.

Any personal information that we collect from your Facebook/Google account may depend on your Facebook/Google accounts privacy settings.
