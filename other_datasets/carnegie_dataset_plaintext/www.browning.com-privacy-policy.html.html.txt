* PURCHASE CONFIRMATION is available for specific Browning firearms and gun safe products and is not required to validate any implied or written warranty requirements. You may confirm your purchase by filling out a form on the Browning Coinfirm Your Purchase Survey Site. {removed href} Click here for information on how to confirm your purchase.. Confirming your purchase enables us to collect personal contact information (as noted above), product data (model, date of purchase, intended use, etc.), as well as demographic and lifestyle information on Browning product owners. We study this marketing information to better serve your needs and interests.


We consider information on firearms and other product purchases (such as model, serial number, purchase date, price paid, etc.) strictly confidential and proprietary. This information is never shared with any third party except to contract with a specialized research agency to organize and quantify this information for our internal marketing analysis or at the specific written request of the Federal government through firearm trace requests or when otherwise required by law.


On the Purchase Confirmation form, you may have the opportunity to indicate interest in optional services and information through the use of opt-in boxes. Opt-in boxes have a default setting that will indicate no interest in the service or information. If you check an opt-in box, we consider this permission to perform the service or give the information described. There are several types of opt-in check boxes that may be available:
