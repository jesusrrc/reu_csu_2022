Please note that if you choose to withdraw your consent, you may not be able to participate in or benefit from our programs, services and initiatives for which you provided consent. We also may use the information we obtain about you in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.


Data Retention.


Your personal information will not be stored for longer than necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or as required under applicable retention policies and/or in accordance with applicable law. Our retention policies reflect local statute of limitation periods and national statutory obligations of UPS.


International Data Transfers.


If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, we may transfer your personal information to countries that have not been found by the European Commission to provide adequate protection, including the United States. For any such transfers, UPS takes necessary contractual measures to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection (including, for example, standard contractual clauses). For further information about UPSs international data transfer practices, and to consult the said contractual measures, please contact us using the contact details in the How to Contact Us section above.


Your Personal Information Rights.


In addition to the right to access and correction, as specified above (under Access and Correction in the main body of this Notice), you have (i) the right to request the transmission of the personal information you have provided to us to you or another company, (ii) the right to object to any uses or disclosures of your personal information, (iii) the right to withdraw your consent in relation to our processing of your personal information based on your consent, (iv) the right to request deletion of your personal information and (iv) the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal information.


You may exercise these rights free of charge unless the request is unfounded, excessive, or otherwise unreasonable, for instance because it is repetitive. In some situations, we may refuse to act or may impose limitations on your rights, as permitted by law. Before UPS is able to provide you with any information or correct any inaccuracies, we may ask you to verify your identity and/or provide other details to help us respond to your request. For the exercise of your rights, please contact us using the contact information provided above in the How to Contact Us section. In all cases, you have a right to file a complaint with a Data Protection Authority.
