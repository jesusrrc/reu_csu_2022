Privacy and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).


As we are a company based in the European Union, we need to comply to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The legal grounds for processing Personal Data under the GDPR described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.


We may process your Personal Data based on several legal grounds. One of the grounds is because we need to perform a contract with you. This is for example the case when we need to comply with the agreements we made together according to the {removed href} {removed hyperref}.


Another legal basis is your given permission. When we ask you for example if we may send you a newsletter, you are asked for your permission to do so.


In some cases, however, we need to collect and save your personal data because this is required by law. For instance, when it is needed to process and store your data for tax liabilities.
