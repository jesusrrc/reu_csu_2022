Innovative Technology Electronics LLC, Victrola has created this online privacy statement in order to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site, {removed href} {removed hyperref}.


COLLECTING INFORMATION ABOUT YOU.


There are instances (such as when you order a part or register a product purchase) when we ask you to provide certain personal information about yourself, such as your name, shipping address, telephone number and email address. We may also maintain a record of your product purchases.


Whether or not you provide such personal information is completely your own choice. However, if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to order parts or access certain content on our website. In addition, we may need to contact you via phone, email or mail to address questions or issues specific to your request, even if you have opted to not receive marketing communications from us.


In general, you can visit most of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We use the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer (or similar computing device), which you use to access our website, to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Your IP address identifies your computer or device and allows us to gather broad demographic information on site visitors, but individual users will remain anonymous, unless you voluntarily tell us who you are.


COOKIES.


Parts of our site use a browser feature called cookies. A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive (or equivalent storage device) of your computer (or similar computing device) when you visit a website. A session cookie expires immediately when you end your session (i. e., close your browser). A persistent cookie stores information on the hard drive; so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available. A cookie will not corrupt your hard drive or transmit viruses to your computer.


We may also evaluate our content and services, and tailor our website for visitors, based on other information we collect such as IP addresses, pixel tags, and the type of internet browser or operating system you are using. This information is collected in the aggregate, but we may tie it to your personal information through use of cookies.


Innovative Technology contracts with numerous service providers to provide us with data collection and reports regarding customer activities on our website. These service providers may use cookies on our behalf and may receive information about your browsing activity. They may store visitor ID, city, state, zip code, and/or email address on our behalf. Under no circumstances may our service providers use your information other than in connection with providing services to us, so that our website can become more useful and efficient. If you would like to opt-out of these particular services, please contact the Innovative Technology Privacy Administrator as indicated below.


USING INFORMATION ABOUT YOU.


We use any personal information that you provide to us to process any requests and follow up with you concerning your inquiry. We also use your personal information so that we may gather data and statistics concerning visitors to our website and analyze such data to look for preferences and trends. Also, if you permit us to do so, we use your personal information so that we may inform you of new products, services and offers from Innovative Technology.


We allow third-party companies to collect certain anonymous information when you visit our websites. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e. g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of material clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or similar technology to collect this information.


PROTECTING CHILDREN.


Innovative Technology does not intentionally collect personal information from children under age 13. If a child has provided us with personal information, a parent or guardian of that child should contact the Innovative Technology Privacy Administrator as indicated below.
