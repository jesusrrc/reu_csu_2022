{removed href} 6. Online Analytics and Advertising.


DELIVERY OF ADVERTISING AND OTHER CONTENT. In addition to ads and content that we serve you directly, PMC may use third party advertising companies and marketing services to serve ads and other content when you visit the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests. Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e. g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may match this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.


We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on the device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties.


If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the {removed href} Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out Page, the Digital Advertising Alliances Consumer Opt-Out link, or {removed href} Your Online Choices to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.


To learn more about how to manage your preferences regarding our cookie-based advertising, please see the {removed href} Cookie Management section in our Cookie Notice below.


To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the {removed href} Google Ads Settings page. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.


PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU EXERCISE THE OPT OUT CHOICES ABOVE, YOU WILL STILL SEE ADVERTISING WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICES, BUT IT WILL NOT BE TAILORED TO YOU BASED ON YOUR ONLINE BEHAVIOR OVER TIME.


MOBILE ADVERTISING. When using mobile applications from PMC or others, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. We may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements. Often, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your mobile device or resetting the Advertising Identifier (like an IDFA) from your mobile devices settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous Advertising Identifier. You may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements.


DO NOT TRACK. PMC does not act on do not track requests from your browser because, this way, we are able to personalize your experiences on our Services.


{removed href} 7. Your Rights Your Choices.


MARKETING EMAILS. If you want to stop receiving promotional e-mails from us, click on the unsubscribe link in any promotional email from us. Please note that once we receive your request, it may take an additional period of time for your opt-out to become effective. We may still communicate with you from time to time if we need to provide you with transaction information about the Services you are using, if we need to request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you, or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons, for example, if we update this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.


SMS TEXT COMMUNICATIONS. You may opt-out of SMS messages from us by following the instructions provided in the message or by texting back STOP to the number we send the text from for that particular SMS message. When we receive an opt-out message from you for SMS messages, we may send a message confirming our receipt of your opt-out.

{removed href} Appendix A: California Privacy Notice.


This Privacy Notice for California residents supplements the {removed href} PMC Privacy Policy.


This Notice applies to website visitors, app users, event attendees and other customers in California. This Notice does not apply to employees, former employees, candidates, contractors, service providers, or business contacts of PMC. This supplemental privacy notice gives California residents additional information about our information collection and use practices required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). The CCPA also provides California residents with specific privacy rights, which are outlined in our Privacy Policy {removed href} here.


This notice provides information about the categories of personal information that we collect from California residents generally, the purposes for which we use the information, the sources of the information, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose the information for business purposes. More detailed information is available in our Privacy Policy at {removed href} How We Use Personal Information and {removed href} How We Share Personal Information.


If you would like to opt out of PMCs use of your information for such purposes that are considered a sale under California law, you may do so as outlined on the following page: {removed href} Do Not Sell My Personal Information. You can also submit a sale opt-out request by emailing us by calling us at {removed href} (877) 365-3500. Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorization.


Please note that PMC employees who are seeking further information about their legal rights under California law should instead contact their PMC HR representative. Applicants submitting information on the PMC Careers pages at {removed href} {removed hyperref} should instead consult the Penske Media Corporation Human Resources Privacy Notice referenced therein.
