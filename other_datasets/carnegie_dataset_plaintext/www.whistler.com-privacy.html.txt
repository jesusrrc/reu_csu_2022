Cookies.


This website (and associated sub-domains) uses cookies which are stored on your browser. You can usually modify your browser settings to prevent this happening. However, by disabling cookies, or certain types of cookie, you may hinder your user experience on this and other websites, or prevent them from working entirely.


Most cookies used on this website are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features. Cookies improve the user experience and enable much of the functionality provided by this website. Our cookies have a duration of 365 days.


Third Party Service Provider Cookies.


Please note that some cookies may be placed by third party service providers who perform certain services. Cookies are used on this website for the following third party services: {removed href} Google Analytics, {removed href} LuckyOrange, {removed href} Arrivalist, {removed href} Bold360 (web chat), {removed href} AddThis social bookmarking tool, and YouTube videos. Some of these services may be used to track your behaviour on other websites and we have no control over this.


We work with Arrivalist to place cookies on your devices and collect the IP address of your devices, which provides Arrivalist with your general location data. Arrivalist uses this data to report to us on an aggregated basis on the effectiveness of our advertisements at inspiring tourists to travel to Whistler and to provide us with statistics on visitors to Whistler (for instance, where they are coming from). In order to do so, Arrivalist may combine your IP address with other information that they have obtained from other sources, as permitted by law. If you wish to opt out of Arrivalist cookies that allow us to collect aggregate information on arrivals to Whistler click {removed href} here. If you opt-out, Arrivalist will also cease collecting information about your IP address from other sources.


Third-party service providers have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.


Advertising Cookies.


Cookies are common in online advertising in order to improve the relevancy of the ads you see and while they are not meant to allow us or our advertising partners to gain personally identifiable information, we will treat this information as personal information if it allows us to identify you personally. We only work with advertising partners who follow {removed href} industry standards and best practices. Some of the vendors we work with who process our data are DoubleClick, Sizmek, and Adobe.


We may use cookies to serve our remarketing campaigns so that advertising vendors, which could include platforms like Google and Facebook, show our ads on sites across the Internet.


Turning Cookies Off.


All modern browsers give you the ability to turn off cookies. For directions on how to do so, click {removed href} here.


By continuing to use this website without adjusting your browsers cookie settings, you agree that we can place these cookies on your device.


Server Logs.


As is true with most websites, our server will automatically log data regarding each visit such as your browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system. We may use this information to monitor server errors, server administration or to monitor visitor behaviour. It is not possible for this to be disabled on a per-user basis so you must leave this website (and the internet entirely) if you do not agree to this happening.

Like most websites on the Internet, this site uses Google Analytics to track items such as pages visited, the kind of computer you are using, how you reached our site and time on site. No personal information is uploaded to Google Analytics. All our activity falls within the bounds of the {removed href} Google Analytics Terms of Service.


This site uses the Lucky Orange analytics system to help improve usability and the customer experience. Lucky Orange may record mouse clicks, mouse movements and scrolling activity but it does not record any Personally Identifiable Information.

We do not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease personal information to anyone.


Customer information is only used or disclosed for the purpose for which it was collected, unless you, as a customer, have otherwise consented, or when it is required or permitted by law or disclosure is authorized by the Act.


If you have booked with Tourism Whistler, we may also use your personal information for direct marketing purposes, unless you choose to opt-out of receiving these offers. On occasion we may use a third party to provide services such as mailing services, some of whom may be located outside of Canada. As a result, these service providers would be provided with the personal information necessary to perform the requested service. Any service provider we use is prohibited from using the information for any purpose other than providing the service Tourism Whistler requests.
