What we appreciate most is the personal approach and dedicated service by the Airivo team. This is hard to find nowadays. They are always there for us - no matter what the query, its always sorted the very same day! Having used serviced offices for more than a decade, I became disillusioned, disappointed and dissatisfied. Then Airivo entered the market and in my opinion revolutionised it. Airivo care about their clients and deliver on the promises made at the point of sale. They are constantly investing in and upgrading their properties, they are proactive with regard to problem solving and a pleasure to work with. I highly recommend Airivo who will restore your faith in serviced office {removed hyperref} months in, we cant imagine being anywhere else in Chiswick. Our sun-soaked office in Gable House was a pristinely blank canvas, ready for the team to make it our own. Gable House itself is a hidden gem, floating serenely above Turnham Green {removed hyperref} staff have been very helpful right from the word go! They have always given me their full attention whenever there was an issue. They have worked with the team to provide a quick and suitable solution and I couldnt be more pleased. They are both professional and courteous - highly recommended! Airivo moved at an unbelievable pace to get us into their Richmond property on our timescale. Nothing was too much trouble as they ensured we received what was promised and more. They delivered a top quality, professional product at a reasonable rate. We have found them to be trustworthy, approachable, friendly and quick to act when required. Their service levels are second to none and we look forward to working with them long-term. {removed href}.
