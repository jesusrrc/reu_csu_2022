We are writing to let you know that Veva is now a Thrasio company. Thrasio is the fastest growing acquirer of Amazon businesses. The exponential growth of the Amazon ecosystem has lead to the creation of thousands of multimillion dollar niche brands, virtually overnight. Many of these companies lack the capacity to sustain further growth without the influx of capital or nuanced expertise. Thats where Thrasio steps in.


As part of operating the Veva, we have updated the {removed href} Privacy Policy to reflect how Thrasio collects, uses, and shares your personal information. Under this new Privacy Policy, we will share your information with other Thrasio brands so that they can market their own products to you.


The new Privacy Policy will become effective on October 8, 2020. If you do nothing, we will handle your information as the new Privacy Policy describes, starting on that date.


If you do not want the new Privacy Policy to apply to your information, please click on the unsubscribe link below, and we will remove your information from our mailing list.


{removed href} Unsubscribe.


Effective as of October 8, 2020.


Veva is a Thrasio brand. This Privacy Policy describes Vevas privacy practices, and the rights and choices available to individuals with respect to their information.


California residents can learn about their additional privacy rights in the Additional information for consumers located in California section below.

WHAT ARE COOKIES?


Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies serve different purposes, like helping us understand how a site is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience.


Our Sites may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them).


We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers or business partners on our Sites, and can be used by these parties to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.

OTHER TECHNOLOGIES.


In addition to cookies, our Sites may use other technologies, such as Flash technology to pixel tags to collect information automatically.


BROWSER WEB STORAGE.


We may use browser web storage (including via HTML5), also known as locally stored objects (LSOs), for similar purposes as cookies. Browser web storage enables the storage of a larger amount of data than cookies. Your web browser may provide functionality to clear your browser web storage.


FLASH TECHNOLOGY.


We may use Flash cookies (which are also known as Flash Local Shared Object (Flash LSOs)) on our Sites to collect and store information about your use of our Sites. Unlike other cookies, Flash cookies cannot be removed or rejected via your browser settings. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer or mobile device, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions. Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our Sites.


WEB BEACONS.


We may also use web beacons (which are also known as pixel tags and clear GIFs) on our Sites and in our HTML formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Sites and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or within HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively.


MOBILE APPLICATION SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KITS (SDKS).


We may use third-party software development kits (SDKs) in our mobile applications. A SDK is third-party computer code that may be used for a variety of purposes, including to provide us with analytics regarding the use of our mobile applications, to integrate with social media, add features or functionality to our app, or to facilitate online advertising. SDKs may enable third parties to collect information directly via our App.


YOUR CHOICES.


Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. Please note that if you set your browser to disable cookies, the Sites may not work properly.
