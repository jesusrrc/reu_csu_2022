13. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.


a) MANDATORY, BILATERAL ARBITRATION AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS.


PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.


YOU AND HANWHA AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND OR PRODUCTS, TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR TO THE CONTENT, ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US AND/OR ANY RECORDING ON THE SERVICES AND/OR PRODUCTS SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY BY FINAL AND BINDING, BILATERAL ARBITRATION, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court in your county of residence within the United States if your claims qualify; and (2) this agreement to arbitrate does not include your or Hanwhas right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court in Los Angeles County California to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a partys copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. The Federal Arbitration Act (the FAA), 9 U. S. C. 1, et seq., and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement and govern all questions as to whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.


{number list}.


{list item} There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms.


{list item} Disputes shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies between you and Hanwha against each other related in any way to or arising out of in any way from this Agreement, the Services, the Products, the Content, and/or User Recording(s), including but not limited to sales, returns, refunds, cancellations, defects, policies, privacy, advertising, or any communications between you and Hanwha, even if the claim arises after you or Hanwha has terminated Services or a user account. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, claims that: (a) you bring against our employees, agents, affiliates, or other representatives; or (b) Hanwha brings against you. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, (i) claims in any way related to or arising out of any aspect of the relationship between you and Hanwha, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, advertising claims, or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before these Terms or out of a prior set of Terms with Hanwha; (iii) claims that are subject to on-going litigation where you are not a party or a class member; and/or (iv) claims that arise after the termination of these Terms.


b) DISPUTE NOTICE. Before initiating an arbitration, you and Hanwha each agree to first provide the other a written notice (Notice of Dispute), which shall contain: (a) a written description of the problem and relevant documents and supporting information; and (b) a statement of the specific relief sought. A Notice of Dispute should be emailed to {removed hyperref}. We will provide a Notice of Dispute to you via the email address associated with your Account. You and Hanwha agree to attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute prior to commencing an arbitration and not to commence an arbitration proceeding until a ninety (90) day post-notice resolution period expires.


c) *ARBITRATION PROCESS AND PROCEDURE *


{number list}.


{list item} If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within ninety (90) days from the original Dispute Notice, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to these terms. Arbitration shall (1) be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (JAMS), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules Procedures then in effect (the JAMS Rules) and as modified by this agreement to arbitrate, including the rules regarding filing, administration, discovery, and arbitrator fees; (2) be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator; and (3) take place in the county where you reside or any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. To the extent that this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards for Procedural Fairness (the Minimum Standards), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply.


{list item} WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION. Further, unless both you and Hanwha expressly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one persons claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsections limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.


{list item} If, for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive our right to a jury trial.


{list item} YOU THEREFORE UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND HANWHA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT.


{list item} The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partys individual claim.


{list item} The JAMS Rules are available on its website at {removed hyperref}/. Notwithstanding any JAMS Rules to the contrary or any other provision in the arbitration rules chosen, by agreement, to govern, you and Hanwha each agree that all issues regarding the Dispute are delegated to the arbitrator to decide. Further, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrators award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.


d) HEARING. If your claim does not exceed 10, 000 (USD), you and Hanwha agree to waive an oral hearing by the arbitrator and the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Hanwha submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. To the extent an oral hearing is requested by you or Hanwha, or deemed necessary by the arbitrator, you and Hanwha agree that the hearing will be conducted telephonically or videographically.


e) ARBITRATORS DECISION. An arbitrators award will be a written statement of the disposition of each claim and will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions which form the basis of the award. The arbitrators decision and award is final and binding, with some limited court review under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.


f) FEES. It is each parties responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, case management/administrative, and arbitrator fees as set forth in the JAMS Rules. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Hanwha will pay the additional cost. If your claim for damages does not exceed 25, 000 (USD) and you follow the dispute notice procedure set forth above, Hanwha will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Dispute or the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).


g) SMALL CLAIMS GOVERNMENT ACTIONS. As an alternative to arbitration, you or Hanwha may resolve Disputes in a small claims court that has jurisdiction over your claim. These Terms and this arbitration agreement do not prevent you from bringing your Dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agency. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against Hanwha on your behalf.


14. Governing Law.


a) THIS AGREEMENT AS WELL AS ANY DISPUTES WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, USA, WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS RULES REGARDING CONFLICTS OF LAWS.


b) In the event the parties dispute this Agreement or the meaning, interpretation or operation of any term, condition, definition or provision of this Agreement resulting in litigation, arbitration or any other form of dispute resolution, the parties agree that the laws of the State of New York shall apply and that all litigation, arbitration or other form of dispute resolution shall take place in the State of New York.
