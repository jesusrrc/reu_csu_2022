Automated Collection of Data.


When you use our Services or open our emails, we may obtain certain information by automated means, such as browser cookies, Flash cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, server logs, and other technologies. The information we obtain in this manner may include your device IP address, domain name, identifiers associated with your devices, device and operating system type and characteristics, web browser characteristics, language preferences, clickstream data, your interactions with our Services (such as the web pages you visit, links you click and features you use), the pages that led or referred you to our Services, dates and times of access to our Services, and other information about your use of our Services. We also may receive your devices precise geolocation and other information related to your location through GPS, Bluetooth, WiFi signals and other technologies for certain purposes listed below, such as to provide you with our Services. Your device may provide you with a notification when the Services attempt to collect your precise geolocation.


A cookie is a text file that websites send to a visitors computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitors browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A Flash cookie, also known as a local shared object, functions like a web cookie to personalize a users experience on sites that use Adobe Flash Player. A web beacon, also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. We and our third-party service providers may use beacons in emails to help us track response rates, identify when our emails are accessed or forwarded, and for other purposes listed below.


These technologies help us (1) remember your information so you will not have to re-enter it; (2) track and understand how you use and interact with the Services; (3) tailor the Services around your preferences; (4) measure the usability of the Services; (5) understand the effectiveness of our communications; and (6) otherwise manage and enhance the Services.


To the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before placing cookies or similar technologies on your computer. You can stop certain types of cookies from being downloaded on your computer by selecting the appropriate settings on your web browser. Most web browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new browser cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new browser cookie and how to disable existing cookies. You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking help on your browsers menu or by visiting {removed hyperref}. Flash cookies typically cannot be controlled, deleted or disabled through your browser settings and instead must be managed through your Adobe Flash Player settings. To manage flash cookies, which we may use on certain websites from time to time, you can go to the Adobe Flash Player Support page available here. In addition, your mobile device settings may allow you to prohibit mobile app platforms (such as Apple and Google) from sharing certain information obtained by automated means with app developers and operators such as us. Our Services are not designed to respond to do not track signals received from browsers. Please note that without cookies or other automated tools we used to collect this type of data (such as geolocation data), you may not be able to use all the features of our Services.


THIRD-PARTY WEB ANALYTICS SERVICES.


Through our Services, we may obtain personal information about your online activities over time and across third-party apps, websites, devices and other online services. On our Services, we use third- party online analytics services, such as those of Google Analytics. The service providers that administer these analytics services use automated technologies to collect data (such as email address, IP addresses, cookies and other device identifiers) to evaluate, for example, use of our Services, to diagnose technical issues and to serve ads. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit {removed hyperref}. html.


ONLINE TRACKING AND INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING.


Through our Services and websites, both we and certain third parties may collect information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent for the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes. You may see our ads on other websites or mobile apps because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users inferred interests and browsing context. These networks track users online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, Flash cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, server logs, web beacons and other similar technologies. The networks use this information to show ads that may be tailored to individuals interests, to track users browsers or devices across multiple websites and apps, and to build a profile of users online browsing and app usage activities. The information our ad networks may collect includes data about users visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on our Services and websites and on third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS.


We do not sell your personal information as the term sell is commonly understood to require an exchange for money. However, the California State Attorney General may issue guidance on whether the use of advertising and analytics cookies on our Website may be considered a sale of personal information as the term sale is broadly defined in the CCPA to include both monetary and other valuable consideration. Until such guidance has been issued, we continue to consider it a sale in order to be as transparent as possible and will comply with the restrictions of the sale of this information to the extent technologically feasible. This sale would be limited to our use of third-party advertising and analytics cookies and their use in providing you behavioral advertising and their use in understanding how people use and interact with our Services and websites.


In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have sold the following categories of personal information to the following categories of third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration:


{number list}.


{list item} Category F: Internet or other similar network activity (INTERNET COOKIE INFORMATION RECIPIENTS, SUCH AS ANALYTICS AND BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING SERVICES; AND ADVERTISERS AND AD NETWORKS).


To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your Authorized Agent) may set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you do not consent to our use of cookies or select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our websites use all the features of our Services. You can find more information about cookies at {removed href} {removed hyperref} and {removed href} {removed hyperref}.


Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into the sale of personal information at any time by adjusting your cookie preferences.


You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. You may be required to provide us with additional contact information so that we may verify your request to opt-in to the sale of your personal information. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.
