I strongly recommend InEvent. First, because we have achieved the goal we initially proposed; second because they helped us not only in the matter of software and solutions delivery but also in planning all the things we were going to do; and third, for all the support we had along the path.

The InEvent platform is incredibly easy to use and if you do get stuck there is always someone on hand to help you quickly and efficiently. We have been using the platform to set up live conferences but have watched InEvent adapt within weeks to integrating a virtual element for their customer.
