<h4>COOKIES AND OTHER DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGY</h4>
<p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your computer’s hard drive. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your computer, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using the Site.</p>

<p>Engine Group also uses web beacons (also called pixel tags or clear GIFs). A web beacon is computer code that communicates information from your Device to a server. Some of Engine Group’s content and emails may contain embedded web beacons that allow a server to read certain types of information from your Device, allow us to count the number of people who have viewed content, to know when you opened an email message and the IP address of your Device. Web beacons help Engine Group develop statistical information to provide better and more personalized content. To learn more about cookies and web beacons, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
<p>Engine Group also uses Google Analytics to collect information. Generally, Google Analytics does not identify individual users.

<h4>DATA RETENTION</h4>
<p>Engine retains data it uses for research purposes for periods determined by our clients, after which the information is removed and discarded.

<p> </p>
<h4>YOUR CHOICES</h4>
<p>We hope that after reading through this Privacy Policy, you agree that Engine is collecting and using data responsibly, and that the cumulative benefits of our work are beneficial to improving the lives of people around the world. At Engine, our goal is to offer a harmonized online experience with whatever browser you use. Most browsers accept cookies by default but in certain cases, like Safari, our cookies are blocked by default by the browser settings. California and EU data subjects have additional access, deletion and opt-out rights as described below. In general, we treat California data subjects that opt-out via the methods described below as having opted out of Engine’s sale of their personal information (to the extent that Engine sells data under California law).</p>
<p>Upon request, Engine will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your PII by contacting us at <a href="mailto:dpo_US@enginegroup.com">dpo_US@enginegroup.com</a>. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. In order to help us to respond promptly to your enquiry or request, please include as much information as you can in your communication with us—such as the reason you believe we hold any of your data, and any other supporting information such as a particular survey or focus group you took part in, or the title of any email you may have received, or the phone number you may have received a call from.</p>
<p>Engine utilizes the services of third parties that are a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and adhere to its Codes of Conduct. You can learn more about the NAI by visiting <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>. NAI offers an online opt-out platform to allow Internet users to express their choices and provides general information related to Interest Based Advertising. You may opt-out of Engine by clicking the opt-out link above and selecting Engine. If you wish to opt out of IBA in general, <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">click here</a>, or if located in the European Union click here. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads if you opt-out.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>MOBILE DEVICE CHOICES</h4>
<p>For mobile websites, you can delete our cookie via the browser settings. For mobile apps, you can typically limit ad tracking within the settings function. On most Android devices, in the “Ads” menu, you can opt out of receiving IBA, or reset your advertising ID. On most Apple iOS devices, you can use the Ad Tracking settings to limit receipt of IBA or reset your device’s Advertising Identifier. Please note that your experience may be different depending on your individual device and service. In addition to using the options above, you may also uninstall the application from your device. If you download a mobile application, it may use advertising to fund its development and maintenance of its software in iOS and Android. In situations involving applications, if you do not want to receive IBA you will need to remove those applications from your device.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>CALIFORNIA DATA SUBJECTS</h4>
<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides additional privacy protections for California data subjects and users, including: a) the right to see what data we have about you, your computer or device (i.e., the right to know), b) the right to delete the data we have about you, your computer or device (i.e., the right to delete) and c) the right to opt-out of the sale of data about you, your computer or device to certain third parties (i.e., the right to opt-out from sales of your information).</p>
<p>You may access those rights with respect to Engine by sending us an email to <a href="mailto:dpo_US@enginegroup.com">dpo_US@enginegroup.com</a> <span style="color: #ff9900;">or calling us via our toll-free California data subject hotline at 833-457-0281</span>. We will take steps to confirm your request within 10 days and make a good faith attempt to fulfill your request within 45 days. Engine does not discriminate against you if you exercise any of the above rights. Please note that we may not be able to honor one or more of these rights if doing so would violate applicable law.</p>
<p>The CCPA defines personal information broadly and as such, it includes pseudonymous identifiers such as cookie IDs and mobile advertising IDs. Under the CCPA, your request to see the personal information that we have about you may include: (1) specific pieces of personal information that we may have about you; (2) categories of personal information we have collected about you; (3) categories of sources from which the personal information is collected; (4) categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose about you; (5) categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose under the CCPA; and (6) the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.</p>
<p>We may take reasonable steps to verify your request. We will fulfill requests we are able to verify so long as we are not prohibited from doing so by applicable law and/or the information is not essential for us for billing, fraud prevention or security purposes. We will share our reason(s) for denying your request in the event that we are unable to fulfill your request.</p>
<p>You may make an access or deletion request via an authorized agent by having such agent follow the process below. Please note that we will request any authorized agent demonstrate that they have been authorized by you to make a request on your behalf. We may require any authorized agents to provide us with contact details such as an email address and phone number so that we may ensure a timely response.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>SAFEGUARDING INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE</h4>
<p>The security of your information is important to us. We have implemented appropriate security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. We take reasonable physical and technical security measures to protect our data from unauthorized access, as well as unauthorized disclosure.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>PRIVACY OF CHILDREN</h4>
<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. In general, neither Engine’s website nor Engine online activities with its clients are intended or designed to knowingly attract children under the age of 13.</p>
