            </span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6 c14">The Internet of Things Privacy Infrastructure Project is a system developed at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, under the coordination of Prof. Norman Sadeh. Its purpose is to provide a tool to publicize the presence of IoT devices, IoT services, IoT apps (collectively referred to as “IoT Resources”) in a given area, such as a university campus, a building,
            </span>
<span class="c6">a shopping
            </span>
<span class="c1">mall, a room, a stadium, a city block, an entire neighborhood, or a larger geographical area. The Internet of Things Privacy Infrastructure Project has two components:
            </span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">1)        The IoTA Mobile App, which helps users discover IoT Resources deployed in their vicinity by identifying and querying IoT Resource Registries that pertain to the user’s current location. The IoTA informs the user about the data collection and use practices associated with the IoT Resources it discovers. The IoTA also enables users to discover and configure privacy settings that may be offered by IoT Resources (i.e. data deletion, opting in or out of some data collection or sharing practices, or data access requests).
            </span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6 c14">2)        The IoT PI, which enables people and organizations to inform the public about the presence of IoT Resources deployed in different areas. Individuals and organizations can request the creation of IRRs through the
            </span>
<span class="c6">IoT PI.
            </span>
<span class="c1"> Individuals and organizations can use the IoT PI to create descriptions of IoT Resources (“IoT Resource Listings”) and request their publication in IRRs, enabling mobile users to discover them using their IoTA Mobile App. The IoT PI also enables users to create partial descriptions of IoT Resources that others could use as a starting point to create IoT Resource Listings (“IoT Resource Templates”). These IoT Resource Templates can be shared with, re-used and edited by others to publicize the presence of identical or similar IoT Resources.  The IoT PI involves the collection of research data under the direction of Prof. Norman Sadeh (the Principal Investigator) in accordance with a research protocol approved by CMU’s Institutional Review Board.
            </span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">The research project related to the IoT PI is funded by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Brandeis Privacy Initiative (Grant FA8750-15-2-0277) and by the U.S. National Science Foundation under its Secure and Trustworthy Computing program (Grant SBE-1513957).

<span class="c1">CMU collects data to provide the Services you request, addressing security issues and potential abuse, ease your navigation of Services supported by our IoTA Mobile App and our IoT PI, communicate with you, improve your experience using the Services and also collect data for research conducted under our project – the latter follows research protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board. Some of this data is provided by you directly, such as when you register for the Services. Some of the information is collected through your interactions with the Services. We collect such data using technologies like cookies and other tracking technologies, error reports, and usage data collected when you interact with CMU Services running on your device.

<span class="font-weight-bold">Location Data:

<span class="c1"> Your Location Data is used to show you relevant IoT Resource Registries and IoT Resources, namely to identify IoT Resource Registries that might be publicizing the presence of IoT Resources near your location, identify nearby IoT Resources, identify the data collection and use practices of these IoT Resources, and to notify you of this information via the IoTA Mobile App. Location data is not accessed or stored anywhere in our databases. The IoTA Mobile App keeps track of the IoT Resources you have been near and the most recent date and time you were near each IoT Resource (“Proximity Data”, a subcategory of Location Data). Proximity Data enables us to provide you with personalized notifications of nearby IoT Resources and avoid sending you repetitive notifications, depending on your notification settings. Proximity Data is only stored on your mobile device; is encrypted; and is deleted (1) when you change your notification settings (selecting between “always”, “the first time” and “never”) or (2) when you uninstall the IoTA mobile app from your device. Proximity Data could be used to infer your location.

This data is collected by your mobile device and only accessed by the IoTA Mobile App to determine when to refresh the data it displays and when to check whether there are new IoT Resources near you that you should be notified about. This data is not stored by the IoTA Mobile App or anywhere in our databases.

<span class="c1">Privacy decisions that you make using the IoTA Mobile App such as opting in or out of some data collection and use practices, requesting that your data be deleted or exercising other privacy choices made available by individual IoT Resources published in the IoT Privacy Infrastructure. These decisions are directly communicated by you to the IoT Resource or to third party privacy options management functionality responsible for implementing them. Please bear in mind that actual implementation of privacy decisions you make about any options made available by IoT Resources is not the responsibility of the IoT PI. Instead these decisions are implemented by the IoT Resources themselves, possibly via third party privacy options management functionality. Such implementation is the responsibility of the IoT Resource owner, who is the Controller of any data collected by the IoT Resource. Our IoT PI collects your privacy decisions, in part for research purposes and in part to be able to show these decisions to you via your IoTA Mobile App. As part of our research, we use your privacy decisions to support the development of models of your privacy preferences using machine learning. Your privacy decisions are uniquely identified and linked to your email ID.

<span class="c1">Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including CMU, do not respond to DNT signals.
