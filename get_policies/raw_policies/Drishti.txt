If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll update the “Last Updated Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective.</li><li><strong>Information Collected or Received from You.</strong> Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services, and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.<ol><li><u>Messaging Drishti.</u> If you contact us through <a href="https://drishti.com/contact/">https://drishti.com/contact/</a> or another method, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, and phone number (“PII”) which you may include in the submission form.</li><li><u>Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies.</u> Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your device by a web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your device. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.<p><strong>“Web Beacons”</strong> (also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the device, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</p>
<p><strong>“Log Data”</strong> means certain information about how a person uses our Services (each, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</p></li><li><u>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device.  </u>We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.</li><li><u>Location Information.</u> When you use our Services, we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Information that We Share with Third Parties.</strong> We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:<ol><li><u>Information Shared with Our Services Providers.</u> We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.</li><li><u>Information Shared with other Third Parties.</u> We may share anonymized or aggregated data we collect from the use of the Services, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location information, information about the computer or device from which you access the Services, market trends and other analysis that we create based on the information we receive from you and other users.</li><li><u>Information Shared with Web Analytics Services Providers.</u> We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, such as HubSpot and Google Analytics to help us measure traffic and usage trends for our website and Services. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving our website. On our website and through our Services, technologies from HubSpot are used to collect and save data for marketing and optimization purposes only. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user. You may find information on the data privacy and data collection policies of HubSpot at <a href="http://legal.hubspot.com/privacy-policy?__hstc=219576070.3caf8aecdb93b7ed4663ce32191fb435.1618955972681.1626710920136.1626726419469.68&amp;__hssc=219576070.1.1626726419469&amp;__hsfp=2769079565" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">http://legal.hubspot.com/privacy-policy</a>.

You may obtain further information with respect to Google Analytics as well as their current Privacy Policy at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners</a>.</li><li><u>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions.</u> Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</li><li><u>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.</u> We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Your Choices.</strong> We offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your PII and we’ll respect the choices you make. Please note that if you decide not to provide us with the PII that we request, you may not be able to access all of the features of the Services.<ol><li><u>Opt-Out of our Mailings.</u> We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote our Services. When you receive such promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive. We do need to send you certain communications regarding the Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy or information about billing.</li><li><u>Opt-out of Ad Tracking.</u> You can opt out of the collection and use of your information for ad targeting by going to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a> or <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a> to limit collection through the Site or by configuring the settings on your mobile device to limit ad tracking through the App.</li><li><u>Modifying Your Information.</u> If you wish us to delete all PII we have collected on you, please contact us at info@drishti.com.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Responding to Do Not Track Signals.</strong> Our Site does not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from various web browsers.</li><li><strong>The Security of Your Information.</strong> We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</li><li><strong>Links to Other Sites.</strong> Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a “Third-party Service”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or that is collected by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.</li><li><strong>International Transfer. </strong>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.</li><li><strong>Our Policy Toward Children. </strong>Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</li><li><strong>Privacy and Storage of the Drishti System Data. </strong>Through our proprietary products Trace and Flow, Drishti helps factory line operators to increase their efficiency by collecting real time data through a system of cameras distributed throughout the manufacturing process (the “Drishti System”). The Drishti System is focused on the manufacturing process and not the individual. Drishti has the utmost respect for individual’s privacy and the Drishti System was specifically designed to not require collection of personally identifiable information (“PII”). Accordingly, we neither capture nor store PII through the Drishti System. In addition, the Drishti System does not collect information on identifying features of an employee nor the employee’s name.<p>The Drishti System collects streams and records video from manufacturing stations at our customer’s facilities. Drishti cameras are typically mounted overhead above the work area. The camera position is chosen to focus on the process and not the operator. This video may contain confidential process and station layout information as well as segments of video where the operator may be identifiable. The video is streamed from the cameras to Drishti’s cloud servers over an encrypted protocol. Once in the cloud, the video is stored in an encrypted form in per-customer storage locations. All customer data is presented back to the customer using Drishti’s web portal which uses Secure HTTP (https://) web protocol. All user access to the web portal is authenticated and is limited to users designated by the customer and can further be limited to specific IP addresses if required.The Drishti System may also (depending in customer needs and use cases) ingest data from the customer’s Manufacturing Execution System (MES). Such data is also transferred to the Drishti Cloud environment in an encrypted manner and stored in segregated, encrypted databases.</p></li><li><strong>Questions?</strong> Please contact us at info@drishti.com if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy. Our Data Protection Officer, Scott Foote, can be contacted at dpo@drishti.com.</li></ol>
