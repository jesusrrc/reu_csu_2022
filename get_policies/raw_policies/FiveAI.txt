The data we collect about you</strong></span><br/><br/>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).<br/><br/>The data we collect, receive from third parties such as our clients, use and store, takes the form of visual images and other footage captured on and around roads from vehicles or other moving or static cameras and/or other sensors. We will not actively seek to identify you, and we will not use the data to monitor or track the movements or activities of individuals for extended periods. However, individuals may be identifiable in the data, for example, from their physical appearance, location, who they are with or any identifier relating to them (e.g. a car number plate).<br/><br/>We may also obtain personal information about you on an ad hoc basis if you provide it to us (e.g. if you contact us) or if others provide us with information about you.<br/><br/>We will not intentionally process any special categories of personal information (this includes details about race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about health and genetic and biometric data). However, we acknowledge that certain aspects of your appearance or activities reflected in the information we collect and receive may fall into these special categories of personal information. As this information only relates to what is visible from a car on a road or from pavements and other public spaces alongside roads, we would only expect this to relate to information about you that you are comfortable allowing to be visible in public areas. We do not intentionally collect or process any information about criminal convictions and offences (we would only process this type of information if it happened to be visible in the data we collect).</div><div class="legal-page-tag-01" id="gen-section-05"></div><div class="legal-para-01"><span class="legal-para-header"><strong>5.

Generally, this will only be where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.<br/><br/>The legitimate interests we rely on as the legal basis of our use of your personal data are the interests of our business and of society more generally in testing, developing, assuring and using autonomous vehicle technologies and our interests in operating our business.  We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
