<b class="western">To Whom do we Disclose Your Information?</b>
</h2>
				Grove Streams uses several 3rd party data processors.
				<ul>
<li>Authorize.net: GroveStreams uses one of the largest providers of credit card-based processing services, 
					Authorize.Net, to manage and store sensitive billing information. When you register a credit card with our service, we 
					will direct you to an Authorize.net secured web page where you will interact directly with their website and your sensitive data
					will be directly stored in their system. After your information is entered into their system, we will receive
					a user identifier (a number). We only store that identifier in our system and use it to process your invoice along with a 
					secret Authorize.net API key. We use the Authorize.net HTTP 
					SSL API for communication from our servers to their servers. Your information stored at Authorize.Net will be removed when you delete your GroveStream
					user profile.
					<a href="https://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/">Authorize.net Privacy Statement</a>
</li>
<li>Twillio: We use Twillio for sending your device SMS event notifications to your phone. We do this by passing the
					notification information, which only includes the phone number and the body of the SMS you configured. Communication with Twillio
					is done over the Internet using Twillio's API, between our servers and their servers, using HTTPS and SSL. 
					<a href="https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy">Twillio Privacy Statement</a></li>
<li>Amazon SES: We use Amazon Simple Email Services to send emails from our service. Emails can be from us or from your optionally configured
					device email event notification. When sending an email we pass the email addresses and the body of the email, using their Java library, which 
					communicates from our servers to Amazon's servers via HTTPS SSL. 
					<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/?nc1=f_pr">Amazon AWS Privacy Statement</a></li>
<li>MapBox Maps: We use MapBox Maps to display your device location. We use their java script API library to display the 
					device location on a map. Only the device GPS location, name, and ID is passed to their API. When a device/component
					is being designed, by you, within our service, you can optionally use the map search field to enter an address to find the device's GPS location. When you do this,
					the information is passed to the Map Box servers to find the GPS location. 		
					<a href="https://mapbox.com/legal/privacy">MapBox Privacy Statement</a>
<li>Ninja Post: We use a 3rd party forum website for our user forum. We only pass your your email address and the current website session token
					 when you choose to use the forum. The forum user profile information and any other information you enter into the forum is 
					 stored in their system.</li>

<h2 class="western">

</h2>
<ul>
<li>We will store your email address and password, encrypted, as a persistent browser cookie when you choose the "Remember Me" option
					while signing in.</li>
<li>We use non-persistent browser secured cookies for other information such as your current authenticated session identifier, whether you're
					 a "Guest" to an organization, your user name, id, and email address. These cookies only remain for the life of the browser session and are not accessible by other applications.</li>
</ul>
<br/> <br/>

					account. You agree to allow information about your use of this website (including your

					of your personal data to be stored there or do not want to receive emails from the forum.</li>
</ul>
<br/> <br/>
<h2 class="western">
<b class="western">What do we do to Keep Your Information
						Secure?</b>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>We use appropriate security measures to protect the security of your 
					personal information both online and offline. These measures vary based 
					on the sensitivity of the personal information we collect, process and 
					store and the current state of technology. We also take measures to ensure 
					service providers that process personal data on our behalf also have 
					appropriate security controls in place.</li>
<li>Please note that no service is completely secure. While we strive to protect 
					your data, we cannot guarantee that 
					unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or a data breach will never occur.</li>
<li>All passwords are stored encrypted and are never unencrypted. If a
					password is lost a new password must be created as Grove Streams
					does not have an external or internal API to recover a password so
					as to prevent anyone from knowing another user's password.</li>
<li>If you provision an API Key, you should keep it secret. You should store your 
					API Key in a secure location. You should only use your API key with HTTPS SSL communications.
					You should not use a single API key for all devices, widgets, or dashboards in case it becomes
					compromised.</li>
<li>Grove Streams employees cannot access your organization and view or edit stream data and dashboards through any 
					user interface. We will request that you add us to the list of organization users in order to assist
					you with any trouble-shooting.</li>
</ul>
<br/> <br/>
<h2 class="western">
<b class="western">Data Retention</b>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>We will retain Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill 
					the purposes outlined in this policy unless a longer retention period is 
					required or permitted by applicable law or regulation.</li>
<li>By default, stream data is retained for two years. You may configure how long data is retained
					by configuring the "Delete Profile" associated with every stream.</li>
<li>Component and Stream data is permanently removed when it is deleted.</li>
<li>Organization information, including components and streams, are permanently removed when the 
					organization is deleted by you or by our system.</li>
<li>Your personal data, within your profile, is immediately deleted when you delete your profile. </li>
<li>Your personal data, residing within our forum, is retained until you delete your forum profile from within the forum.</li>
<li>Some information will be retained in audit and diagnostic logs per regulations.</li>
</ul>
<br/> <br/>
<h2 class="western">
<b class="western">Third-Party Links</b>
</h2>
				This site may contain links to other sites outside our control.
				GroveStreams.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the
				content of such web sites. <br/> <br/>
<br/> <br/>
<h2 class="western">
<b class="western">Do not Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms</b>
</h2>
				Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the
				websites with which the user communicates, although web browsers
				incorporate and activate this functionality in different ways, and
				it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be
				transmitted. There currently is disagreement, including among
				participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization,
				concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive
				such signals. Grove Streams currently does not take action in
				response to these signals, but, if and when a standard is
				established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these
				signals. <br/> <br/>
<br/> <br/>
<h2 class="western">Data Ownership</h2>

				Your data belongs to you and you are free at any time to access it
				through our service until you delete your organization and user
				account. We do not scan your component or stream data for any information for
				marketing purposes. We do not share your data with anyone with
				the exception of 3rd party processors noted above.
				
				
				<br/> <br/>
<h2 class="western">Grove Streams as a 3rd Party Data Processor</h2>
				Grove Streams can also be used as a 3rd party data processor. Some
				companies use us as a service and can OEM Grove Streams to look like their own service.
				These companies may use Grove Streams to store other user's data.
	 
				<br/> <br/>
				These companies will not have access to your credit card information as long as it is being 
				stored in our secure location (you used our service to enter credit card information). These companies can 
				configure Grove Streams organizations so that they have access to some of your profile information once you have been added
				to an organization via your email address. They can configure the organization so that they have access to all
				information stored in the organization they Own or have configured to give them rights to do so. If they 
				are storing sensitive information within Organizations, Components, Streams, 
				Dashboards, or Maps, it is their responsibility to ensure it is secured and handled to satisfy regulations in 
				the areas they are operating in. 
				
				<br/> <br/>
				These types of of Grove Streams users must have their own Privacy page that describes, and satisfies data privacy regulations.
				They must ensure that their user's personal data is secure and not shared without their knowledge. 
				They must provide links to our Terms and Privacy pages so that their users understand how we are being 
				used and how their personal data is handled. 

				
				
				<br/> <br/>
<h2 class="western">Changes to our Policy</h2>
				If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those
				changes on this page.
