For instance, regardless of whether you are watching a video, YouTube will always establish a connection with the Google DoubleClick network.</p><p>As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on this website, a connection to YouTube’s servers will be established. As a result, the YouTube server will be notified, which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account while you visit our site, you enable YouTube to directly allocate your browsing patterns to your personal profile. You have the option to prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.</p><p>Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube will be able to place various cookies on your device or comparable technologies for recognition (e.g. device fingerprinting).

Pursuant to Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR, this is a legitimate interest. If a corresponding agreement has been requested, the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at any time.</p><p>For more information on how YouTube handles user data, please consult the YouTube Data Privacy Policy under: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>.</p><p> </p><p>7.

A visit to our social media sites triggers numerous processing operations. In detail:</p><p>If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media presence, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. However, your personal data may also be collected if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data is collected, for example, via cookies that are stored on your end device or by recording your IP address.</p><p>With the help of the data collected in this way, the operators of social media portals can create user profiles in which detail your preferences and interests. In this way, interest-based advertising can be displayed to you both inside and outside the respective social media presence. If you have an account with the respective social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on all devices on which you are or were logged in.</p><p>Please also note that we are not able to track all processing on the social media portals. Depending on the provider, further processing may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media portals. For details, please refer to the terms of use and data protection regulations of the respective social media portals.</p><p>Legal basis</p><p>Our social media appearances are designed to ensure a comprehensive presence on the Internet. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR.

You can assert your rights (information, correction, deletion, restriction of processing, data transferability and complaint) against us and against the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g. against Facebook).</p><p>Please note that despite the joint responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have full insight into the data processing operations of the social media portals. Our possibilities are largely determined by the corporate policy of the respective provider.</p><p>Data retention period</p><p>The data collected directly by us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon as the purpose for storing them no longer applies, you request us to delete them, revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies. Stored cookies remain on your own device until you delete them. Mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods - remain unaffected.</p><p>We have no influence on the storage period of your data, in as far as this data is stored by the operators of the social networks for their own purposes.
