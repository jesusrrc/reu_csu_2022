Upon receipt of full payment therefor, INSEEGO grants to Buyer a nonexclusive, personal, nontransferable, limited and royalty-free license to use and execute such Software in object code form only and only in conjunction with the operation of the associated Product. Buyer shall receive no rights to the Software except as expressly provided herein. No license to use the source code of the Software is provided hereunder.

Except as expressly set forth herein, INSEEGO shall have no obligations to Buyer whatsoever with regard to the Software.  Without limiting the generality of foregoing, INSEEGO has no obligation to develop updates or modifications to the Software or develop or provide Software development tools to Buyer.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Price; Payment Terms</strong></h4>
<p><strong>2.1. </strong>The prices for all Products and Services shall be as set forth in INSEEGO’s quote and/or order acknowledgment and such prices shall be exclusive of all taxes and other charges referenced in Section 2.2 below, all of which shall be paid by Buyer. INSEEGO shall submit an invoice to Buyer with each shipment of Products. Each invoice shall be due and payable in U.S. Dollars net thirty (30) days from the date of shipment. Such payment terms are subject to credit approval. INSEEGO reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to limit, cancel or modify Buyer’s credit terms as to time or amount from time to time and without prior notice.

If claiming tax exemption, Buyer must provide INSEEGO with valid tax exemption certificates.</p>
<p><strong>2.3.</strong> If Buyer fails to pay any invoice when due, INSEEGO may charge Buyer interest in an amount equal to the lesser of one and one-half percent (1½%), or the maximum permissible rate, per month on any past due balance. INSEEGO may withhold delivery of any Products or Services at any time in which Buyer’s account is past due or exceeds its approved credit limit. If INSEEGO employs any legal process to recover any amount due and payable from Buyer hereunder, Buyer shall pay all costs of collection and reasonable attorney’s fees.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Delivery; Acceptance</strong></h4>
<p><strong>3.1. </strong>All Products will be delivered FOB (for domestic shipments) or EXW (for international shipments), INSEEGO’s designated factory. Delivery shall occur, title to the Products (except for title to any Software which shall at all times remain with INSEEGO) shall pass from INSEEGO to Buyer, and Buyer shall assume all risk of loss or damage, upon delivery of the Products to the carrier, unless otherwise agreed by both parties in writing.

<p><strong>3.2. </strong>Buyer shall inspect all Products promptly upon receipt. The furnishing by INSEEGO of a Product to Buyer shall constitute acceptance of that Product unless INSEEGO receives a written notice of defect or nonconformity within five (5) business days after receipt by Buyer, provided, that such acceptance shall not relieve INSEEGO of its warranty obligations hereunder.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Changes; Cancellation; No Returns</strong></h4>
<p><strong>4.1. </strong>INSEEGO reserves the right to (a) make changes in Products without notice, and without any obligation to incorporate those changes in any Products previously delivered to Buyer and (b) ship to Buyer the most current Product regardless of catalog description, if applicable.</p>
<p><strong>4.2. </strong>Buyer may make changes to any order for standard Products which does not exceed $5,000 (it being agreed that any series of similar orders for standard Products shall be aggregated and deemed one order for the purpose of determining such amount) by providing written notice to INSEEGO at least thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled shipment date. Any changes to any order for custom or option configured Products, or any order or series of similar orders for standard Products which exceeds $5,000, including but not limited to any changes to the specifications for the Products, must be approved in advance in writing by INSEEGO. INSEEGO must receive Buyer’s change request at least thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled shipment date. In the event of changes to any order or the specifications for the Products, INSEEGO reserves the right to adjust the prices and delivery dates for the Products, and to invoice Buyer for any unearned discounts based upon the actual quantities of Products delivered. In addition, Buyer shall be responsible for all costs associated with such change including, but not limited to, the burdened costs of all raw materials, work in progress and finished goods inventory on-hand or ordered which are impacted by such change.</p>
<p><strong>4.3. </strong>Any order for standard Products which does not exceed $5,000 (it being agreed that any series of similar orders for standard Products shall be aggregated and deemed one order for the purpose of determining such amount) may be cancelled by Buyer by providing written notice to INSEEGO at least thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled shipment date. Any order for custom or option configured Products, or any order or series of similar orders for standard Products which exceeds $5,000, may be cancelled only upon COMPANY’s prior written approval, which approval may be granted or withheld in INSEEGO’s sole discretion. Any order cancellation will be subject to the following cancellation charges with respect to all cancelled units of Products: (a) the contract price of all Products completed prior to such cancellation; (b) the burdened cost of all raw materials (including long lead time items) in INSEEGO’s possession or on order, (c) the burdened cost of all raw materials incorporated into and all labor applied to work in progress, plus profit thereon in accordance with INSEEGO’s published margins; and (d) other reasonable cancellation charges including, but not limited to, non-recurring engineering expenses, cancellation costs payable by INSEEGO to its suppliers, and any other costs incurred by INSEEGO relating to such cancellation. INSEEGO will use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce such cancellation costs by reallocating materials to other projects and/or returning surplus material to, or canceling orders with, its suppliers. In no event shall the Buyer be liable for more than the contract price of the cancelled Products.</p>
<p><strong>4.4. </strong>Products are non-returnable except for valid warranty claims.  </p>

INSEEGO shall repair or replace, at INSEEGO’s sole option, any defective or nonconforming Product or part thereof which is returned at Buyer’s expense to INSEEGO’s facility, provided, that Buyer notifies INSEEGO in writing promptly after discovery of the defect or nonconformity and within the Warranty Period. Products may only be returned by Buyer when accompanied by a return material authorization number (“<strong>RMA#</strong>”) issued by INSEEGO’s Return Department, with freight prepaid by Buyer. INSEEGO shall not be responsible for any damage occurring in transit or obligated to accept Products returned for warranty repair without an RMA#. Buyer bears all risk of loss or damage to the Products until delivery at INSEEGO’s designated facility. INSEEGO shall pay for shipment back to Buyer for Products repaired under warranty.

<p><strong>6.4. </strong>THE FOREGOING WARRANTY IS EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, INSEEGO MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, EITHER IN FACT OR BY OPERATION OF LAW, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING THE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE OR SERVICES.

INSEEGO shall defend, at its expense, any such suit or proceeding provided that: (a) Buyer gives INSEEGO prompt notice in writing of any such suit and permits INSEEGO through counsel of its choice, to answer the charge  of  infringement  and  defend  such  suit;  and  (b)  Buyer  gives  INSEEGO  all  the  needed information, assistance and authority, at INSEEGO’s expense to enable INSEEGO to defend such suit.

INSEEGO  shall, at  its option,  either (1) procure  for Buyer the  right to continue  using such infringing Product or Software; (2) replace the infringing Product or Software with a non- infringing item of like form, fit or function; (3) modify the Product or Software so that it no longer infringes; or (4) remove the Product or Software and refund the purchase price to Buyer. THIS SECTION STATES INSEEGO’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY, AND THE BUYER’S SOLE REMEDY, FOR ANY ACTUAL OR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OF ANY PATENT OR COPYRIGHT BY ANY PRODUCT OR SOFTWARE DELIVERED HEREUNDER OR ANY PARTS THEREOF.

Buyer shall defend, at its expense, any suit brought against INSEEGO alleging any such infringement provided that INSEEGO (i) gives Buyer prompt notice of any such suit and permits Buyer, through counsel of its choice, to defend such suit and (ii) gives Buyer all needed information, assistance and authority, at Buyer’s expense, necessary for Buyer to defend any such suit.</p>
<h4><strong>8. Customer Furnished Material</strong></h4>
<p><strong>8.1.</strong> In the event that Buyer, with INSEEGO’s prior approval, provides products, raw materials, fixtures or tools (collectively, the “<strong>Customer Furnished Material</strong>” or “<strong>CFM</strong>”) to INSEEGO for incorporation into, or use in the manufacture of, the Products, or in conjunction with the Services, Buyer shall retain title to, and shall continue to bear all risk of loss or damage to, such CFM. CFM IS PROVIDED BY BUYER AT BUYER’S RISK. IN NO EVENT SHALL INSEEGO BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE TO SUCH CFM RESULTING FROM ANY CAUSE WHILE IN INSEEGO’S POSSESSION. BUYER SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR INSURING THE CFM AGAINST ANY SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE.</p>
<p><strong>8.2.</strong> CFM certification and quality are the responsibility of Buyer. All CFM is subject to inspection by INSEEGO upon receipt, and INSEEGO reserves the right to refuse the CFM and/or re-quote the order based upon such inspection. CFM is not guaranteed to yield Buyer’s total order quantity. If material shortages occur due to yield, Buyer shall, at its option, either supply additional CFM to complete the order or close the order short. Any CFM not used by INSEEGO will be returned to Buyer, at Buyer’s risk and expense.</p>
<h4><strong>9. Limitation of Liability</strong></h4>
<p><strong>9.1.</strong> INSEEGO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY COMMERCIAL LOSSES, LOSS OF REVENUES OR PROFITS, LOSS OF GOOD WILL, INCONVENIENCE, OR EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, OR CLAIMS OF THIRD PARTIES, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ANY CLAIM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT, WHETHER FROM BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS, OR LOSS OF DATA OR FROM ANY OTHER USE, EVEN IF INSEEGO HAS BEEN ADVISED OR SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. INSEEGO’S LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT.</p>
<h4><strong>10. General</strong></h4>
<p><strong>10.1. </strong>Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless INSEEGO from and against any expense or loss resulting from any actual or alleged infringement of any patent or copyright arising as a result of (a) INSEEGO’s compliance with any of Buyer’s designs, specifications or instructions, (b) the use or incorporation of such Product or Software in a manner or in combination with any other products, devices or parts not specified in INSEEGO’s specifications therefor, or (c) modifications of such Product or Software by Buyer or any party (other than INSEEGO) which were not approved by INSEEGO. Buyer shall defend, at its expense, any suit brought against INSEEGO alleging any such infringement provided that INSEEGO (i) gives Buyer prompt notice of any such suit and permits Buyer, through counsel of its choice, to defend such suit and (ii) gives Buyer all needed information, assistance and authority, at Buyer’s expense, necessary for Buyer to defend any such suit.</p>
<p><strong>10.2. </strong>Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Ultimate Destination of the Products and Software is in the United States of America, unless otherwise indicated in the INSEEGO quote and/or order acknowledgment. Buyer shall not, nor shall Buyer authorize or permit its employees, distributors, customers, and/or agents to, export or re-export any of the Products or Software (including any information relating thereto) to any foreign national, nation, firm, or country, including foreign nationals employed by or associated with Buyer, without first complying with all U.S. laws, regulations or ordinances including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), including the requirement for obtaining an export license, if applicable. Buyer agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless INSEEGO from and against any claim, loss, liability, expense, or damage (including liens or legal fees) incurred by INSEEGO with respect to any of Buyer’s export or re-export activities contrary to this provision.</p>
<p><strong>10.3. </strong>If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is held to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remaining provisions shall remain, nevertheless, in full force and effect. The parties agree to renegotiate in good faith any term held invalid and to be bound by the mutually agreed substitute provision in order to give the most approximate effect intended by the parties.</p>
<p><strong>10.4. </strong>No waiver of any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be valid or binding on any party unless agreed to in writing by the party to be charged. The failure of either party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions, or the failure to require at any time performance by the other party of any of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions, shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provisions, nor in any way affect the validity of either party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>10.5. </strong>INSEEGO shall have the right to terminate any order, or to delay the shipment thereof, by reason of (a) Buyer’s bankruptcy or insolvency, or the pendency of any proceedings against Buyer under any statute for the relief of debtors; (b) Buyer’s breach of these Terms and Conditions; (c) INSEEGO’s learning that the ultimate destination of the Products is other than that set forth in the INSEEGO quote; or (d) failure of Buyer to meet any other reasonable requirements established by INSEEGO or to provide timely responses to requests from INSEEGO (including acts or omissions of Buyer which may delay production).</p>
<p><strong>10.6. </strong>INSEEGO shall not be responsible for any changes or inaccuracies made in the published rate plans or promotions of any wireless service provider.  Wireless service coverage may   vary   due   to   Buyer’s   equipment, radio transmission limitations, terrain, human involvement, acts of nature and other reasons.   Due to wireless coverage limitations the transmission of voice and data information may not be accessible at all times.  All claims to the performance and availability of product and service are subject to the performance of the service provider or the manufacturer of the product.</p>
<p><strong>10.7. </strong>These Terms and Conditions shall be construed under and according to the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The parties agree that jurisdiction and venue for any actions relating to these Terms and Conditions will be in the state or federal courts located in San Diego County, California. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in San Diego County, California, for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, or that such suit, action or proceeding is improper.</p>
<p><strong>10.8.</strong> In the event of any action, suit or proceeding relating to the subject matter hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled, in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have, to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and related costs from the non-prevailing part.</p></div></div></div></div></div><hr class="privacy-policy_hr__3D_8O mb-5"/></div><div id="card-3"><h2 class="pb-3 pt-5" id="impressum">Impressum</h2><div class="privacy-policy_description__30mxu"><p><strong>Website Owner Company Information:</strong></p>
