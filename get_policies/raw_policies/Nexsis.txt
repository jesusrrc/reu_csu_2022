<p><strong>Case Law, Legal Analysis and Reviews</strong></p>
<p>For where local legislation or court embargos apply, the case law and legal analysis that reference to this case law which we provide as part of our Services may include personal information.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that such personal information is a matter of official court / public record. This information has been supplied to LexisNexis for publication to our clients by the public bodies concerned in the interests of upholding and protecting the rule of law. Further, it is important to the effectiveness of legal systems globally that our users can draw on a body of historical case law, including through understanding the circumstances of the individuals referred to therein.</p>
<p>While the authors of the papers, journals and case commentary that we provide via our Services may refer to such records, we have no power over what is reported within the court records themselves. It is for the court to decide what personal information is to remain within the records that they disclose, and the balance to be struck between the public interests in disclosure and the privacy rights of individuals.</p>
<p>Please refer to the main section of this privacy policy for details on your rights, retention, locations of processing, and contact details for any privacy and data protection inquiries.</p>
