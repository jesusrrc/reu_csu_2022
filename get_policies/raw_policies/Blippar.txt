<div class="typeset typeset--body-dark"><p>Last modified: 7th August 2019<br/></p>
<p>Your privacy is important to us at Blippar Ltd (“Blippar”). When you use the
Blippar Services, we will receive some information about you. When we talk
about the Blippar Services, we mean the websites, apps, tools and other
products, services and features offered by Blippar and linked to this privacy
policy.
</p>
<p>Some of the information we receive is Personal Data, which means it could
be used to directly or indirectly identify a natural person.
</p>
<p>This policy is designed to explain to you what information about you,
including Personal Data, Blippar collects in providing the Blippar Services,
how that information is used and shared and the control you have over that
information.
</p>
<p><strong>Data processed by Blippar</strong><br/><strong><u>
App users</u></strong><br/>
We do not ask that you set up an account to use the Blippar app to explore
the world around you. However, when you point your device and click to
scan, or ‘blipp’, an object, we will collect and store information about you.
The legal ground for processing information for this purpose is based on
Blippar’s legitimate interest in serving you the correct content as part of an
AR experience (also called a ‘blipp’) and continuously improving our
Services.
</p>
<p>This includes digital images of the people or items you blipped, your GPS
location, IP address and Advertising ID. We’ll never share that information
with anyone outside of the Blippar Group.
</p>
<p>It also includes information about how you have interacted with our Services
and the blipps, such as the time and frequency of the interactions, dwell time
and the devices and operating systems used to access the blipps, so we can
understand more about the user journey.
</p>
<p>If the blipp is connected to a client of ours, all information about blipp
interactions is combined and shared with them in a way that doesn’t identify
any individuals, so that they can better understand the performance of the
blipps.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, the blipp experience will be designed to request more Personal
Data from you, such as your name and email address, usually in relation to
promotional activity. In each case, the purpose of the data collection and
processing will be explained to you beforehand and you will have the option
of not providing the additional information.
</p>
<p>The above information is also received by Blippar when you access a blipp
through third party apps, via an API. Those third parties may decide to
collect and send to us additional Personal Data; you can read more about
that in their privacy policies.
</p>
<p><strong><u>Account holders
</u></strong></p>
<p>Users of Blippar’s tools, including the Blippbuilder suite of products, our
Software Development Kit, will also sign up to a Hub account. We will obtain
Personal Data from you to set up the account on your behalf, or you may
provide the details via a form to set up the account directly.
</p>
<p>We will use your name and email address to create your account profile and
to communicate with you regarding the Services, if there are any technical or
operational issues or updates which we think our account holders need to
know about, or if we make any material changes to our Terms or this Privacy
Policy.
</p>
<p>We will also ask for the region you are in, so that we know where we will
need to publish the content you create, which is stored on our platform. That
content might include digital images of you or other people, which would
constitute Personal Data.
</p>
<p>The legal ground for processing information for this purpose is for the
performance of the contract between us, under which we are delivering our
Services to you.
</p>
<p>If you provide your opt-in consent to receive marketing information from
Blippar, we will also collect and process your name, email address, company
and location details for the purpose of sending you tailored marketing
information about Blippar products and services, regular newsletters, blog
entries and industry updates. The legal ground for processing information for
this purpose is consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time through
the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails.
</p>
<p>When you interact with our customer support representatives or your
account manager via email, telephone, or online, we collect personal data,
such as your name, phone number, email address, IP address and contact
preferences, information about the Blippar Services you are using, and any
other information you volunteer. We also may create event logs to assist with
diagnosing and resolving product or app performance-related issues, and
capture information relating to the support or service issue. The legal ground
for processing information for this purpose is legitimate interests in providing
you with quality customer and product support.
<br/></p>
<p><strong><u>Other clients</u></strong>
<br/></p>
<p>Other Blippar clients, or prospective clients, may provide us with Personal
Data, including name, email address, phone number and other contact
information, in connection with the Blippar Services you are, or will be,
receiving. The legal ground for process information for this purpose is for the
performance of the contract between us, for these Services, or in preparation
for entering into that contract. In the delivery of the Services, you might also
provide us with content that contains Personal Data, such as digital images
of individuals.
</p>
<p><strong>Transfer of personal data
</strong></p>
<p>Blippar is a global company which transfers Personal Data to other Blippar
companies in other countries in order to deliver and maintain our Services.
The information we collect in relation to you is stored on data centres
operated by our third party providers. Our AWS data centres are currently
based in Europe and the United States. By using Blippar Services, you
consent to the hosting of your personal information on servers in both
</p>
<p>locations and the transfer of your Personal Data outside of the country it was
collected. It is important to note that countries have different regulations in
relation to personal information, including in relation to rights of access by
law enforcement authorities.
</p>
<p>We will share your Personal Data in the following ways:
</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Service Providers</strong> – we provide Personal Data to service providers
who provide services on our behalf. This includes cloud storage
providers, customer support providers, email marketing and SaaS
providers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Affiliates</strong> – we will share Personal Data with the Blippar Group
companies. All Blippar companies follow privacy practices set out in
this Privacy Policy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Clients</strong> – we will share non-identifiable, aggregated data relating to
your blipp activity with our clients to whom the blipp is connected. If
you have provided additional Personal Data as part of the blipp (eg. as
part of a competition entry), we will transfer this information to our
clients and notify you beforehand.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other Third Party Disclosures</strong></p><ul><li><p>we may also disclose Personal Data about you to others if: we
need to comply with a legal or court order, governmental
request, investigation, subpoena or other legal obligation;</p></li><li><p>we need to detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns;</p></li><li><p>we are involved in a partial or total merger, joint venture,
acquisition, financing, asset sale, liquidation or bankruptcy, we
may share Personal Data with the other party(s) ahead of that
transaction;</p></li><li><p>we are enforcing any of our terms or policies or pursuing legal
remedies or defending legal claims;</p></li><li><p>we have your valid consent.</p></li></ul></li>
</ul><p><strong>Cookies and Other Technologies
</strong></p>
<p><em>What is a cookie?
</em></p>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier
that is sent to your computer, tablet or mobile phone web browser from a
website’s computer (i.e., a Web server) and is stored on your computer, table
or mobile phone web browser.
</p>
<p><em>How does Blippar use cookies?
</em></p>
<p>In general terms, Blippar only uses cookies to record information about your
preferences, how you prefer to use our websites and our services. They allow
us to tailor our app, websites and our other services to your interests.
</p>
<p>Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of visitors
to our app and website and users of our other services and help us to
provide you with a better user experience.
</p>
<p><em>Third party cookies
</em></p>
<p>We use analytics cookies and mobile device equivalents served by our third
party providers to analyse how users use our app and websites and report
back to us. This helps us work out what elements of the app and websites
are working and helps us improve them. In the future, we may have digital
advertising partners who may use cookies, mobile equivalents and other
technologies to collect information to support the delivery of interest-based
advertising to users. We will ensure you are properly notified including
through updates to this policy before that happens.
</p>
<p><em>Third party cookies in embedded content on Blippar pages
</em></p>
<p>Please note that during your visits to our websites you may notice some
cookies that are not related to Blippar or Blippar’s partners. When you visit a
page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Flickr, you may
be presented with cookies from these websites (“Third Party Websites”).
Blippar does not control the dissemination of these cookies. Any information
that you provide on or to a Third Party Website or that is collected by a Third
Party Website is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third Party
Website and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. Blippar is
not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of
any Third Party Website. To protect your information we recommend that
</p>
<p>you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Websites that you
access.
</p>
<p><em>Blippar cookies and how to reject cookies
</em></p>
<p>If you wish to control what cookies are set on your device through our app,
websites or other services then you can by changing the settings on your
personal computer or mobile device web browser. It is important to note that
if you change your settings and block certain cookies, this means that certain
personalised features and other functionality cannot then be provided to you
and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the app,
websites or our other services features.
</p>
<p><em>Other information collected from web browsers
</em></p>
<p>Your web browser may also provide Blippar with information about your
device, such as an IP address and details about the browser that you are
using. It may also provide Blippar with access to details of your personal
computer or mobile device’s location.
</p>
<p><strong>Children
</strong></p>
<p>Blippar does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13. If
we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under 13, we will
take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. If we need to rely
on consent as legal grounds for processing Personal Data and your country
requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent’s consent before
we collect and use that information.
</p>
<p><strong>Retention of Personal Data
</strong></p>
<p>We will retain Personal Data for as long as your Blippar account is considered
to be active, or otherwise for as long as is necessary for the purposes for
which it is being processed, including for ongoing product and service
improvement purposes. See below for your rights in relation to the erasure of
Personal Data we keep about you.
</p>
<p><strong>Your Rights under GDPR
</strong></p>
<p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation, individuals have the right to
request access to and rectification or erasure of your Personal Data, data
portability, restriction of processing of your Personal Data. You also have the
right to object to processing of your Personal Data.
</p>
<p>By emailing <a href="mailto:delete@blippar.com">delete@blippar.com</a>, you can have all account data deleted – if
you do this a red flag goes on the database and, while Blippar cannot use
the personal information, it stays on the system for a period for
administration purposes before being deleted automatically.
</p>
<p>You can contact us at <a href="mailto:info@blippar.com">info@blippar.com</a> to request information in connection
with any of your rights under GDPR.
</p>
<p>If you have access to Hub, you can delete blipps that you have created,
which might contain Personal Data. This content will stay on our systems so
that we can offer it to you for future blipps, so make sure you email us<br/>
at <a href="mailto:delete@blippar.com">delete@blippar.com</a> if you want it permanently removed.
</p>
<p>If you are based in the European Union, you can lodge a complaint with a
supervisory authority in your Member State. For example, if you reside in the
UK, you can file a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office
(“ICO”).
</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy Updates
</strong></p>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, as we add new
products and services, make improvements to our existing products and
services, and as technologies and laws change. You can see when this Privacy
Policy was last revised by referring to the date at the top of the Privacy Policy
that is available on our website and mobile app. At times, we may provide
you with additional notice, such as by adding a statement to our website or
in-app notification, or emailing you, where possible. We may be required by
law to obtain your consent with respect to these changes.
