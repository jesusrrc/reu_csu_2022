Each cookie is unique to your web browser or mobile application. A cookie typically contains an identifier, a site name and some numbers and characters. Like most website or Internet service providers, GalaxyCore uses cookies for the same purpose, i.e. improving the user experience. Cookies enable websites to remember a single visit (using a session cookie) or multiple visits (using a permanent cookie) by a user.

<h3>3. How GalaxyCore discloses Personal Data</h3>
<p>GalaxyCore shares your personal data with other partners, as described in this Policy, when services are provided by partners authorized by GalaxyCore. In addition, as required by the applicable laws or in response to legal procedures, GalaxyCore may also disclose your personal data to the law enforcement authorities or other government authorities. If GalaxyCore is involved in reorganization, merger or bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings in a given jurisdiction,, your personal data may also be disclosed to the counter party.

<p>You also have the right to withdraw your consent at any time to your personal data being processed by GalaxyCore as required by applicable laws. However, withdrawal of consent does not affect the legality and effectiveness of your personal data previously processed by us with your consent, nor does it affect your personal data being processed on other appropriate grounds.</p>
<h3>5. How GalaxyCore Protects and Retains Your Personal Data</h3>
<p>GalaxyCore values the security of personal data. We take appropriate physical, administrative and technical safeguards to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, modification, damage or loss.

We will make every effort to protect your personal data; however, please note that no security measure is perfect.</p>
<p>We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes stated in this Policy, unless an extension of the retention period is required or permitted by law. The retention period of data may vary with scenarios, products and services. The factors to be taken into account for determining the retention period include: time required to achieve the business purpose, and for response to possible user inquiries or complaints, trouble shooting, etc.; whether a user agrees with a longer retention period; whether retention of data is specifically required by laws and contracts. We will retain your registration information as long as your account is required for providing services to you. You may also choose to cancel your account. After cancellation, we will suspend products and services based on such account and delete your personal data if not specifically required by laws.</p>
<h3>6. How GalaxyCore Processes Personal Data from Minors</h3>

Where personal data on minors is collected with the consent of their parents, we will only use or disclose such data to the extent permitted by law, with the explicit consent of their parents or guardians, or when it is necessary to do so to protect the minors. If GalaxyCore finds that the personal data on minors has been collected without prior provable consent of their parents, it will use every effort to delete the data as soon as possible.</p>
