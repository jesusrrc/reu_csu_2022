<h3>4. Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
<p><em>Business Partners.</em><br/>From time to time, the Company may partner with other companies to jointly offer products, services or programs (such as webinars or downloadable content) such as our channel partners to fulfill product trials and information requests, and provide customers and prospective customers with information about the Company and its products. To do this, we may pass your information to them for that purpose only, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. The Company does not share Data about the Company attendees with business partners unless: (1) you specifically opt in to such sharing via an event registration form; or (2) you attend a Company event and allow the Company or any of its business partners to scan your attendee badge. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may choose not to opt in via event registration forms and elect not to have your badge scanned at Company events. If you choose to share your information with business partners in the manners described above, your information will be subject to the business partners’ respective privacy statements. The Company sometimes hires vendor companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering items, sending postal mail, providing technical support, and processing event registrations. We provide those companies only the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p><em>Third Parties.</em><br/>Section 7 of this Privacy Statement, Website Navigational Information, specifically addresses the information we or third parties collect through cookies and web beacons, and how you can control cookies through your Web browser.

<h3>5. Children and Privacy</h3>
<p>The Company Websites do not offer information intended to attract children. The Company does not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the age of 16.</p>
<h3>6. Security of Personal Information</h3>
<p>The Company take precautions including organizational, technical and physical measures to help safeguard against the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration and unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, the Data we process or use. For example, when you submit any form requiring registration, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) helps protect your information as it travels over the Internet by encrypting that information before it is sent to us. Please note that while we have implemented industry-standard security mechanisms and procedures to protect data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure. You are solely responsible for protecting your password, limiting access to your devices and signing out of websites after your sessions.</p>
<h3>7. Use of Cookies, Usage Data</h3>
<p><em>Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Addresses.</em><br/>The Company uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company’s Websites (“Website Navigational Information”). As described more fully below, we and our partners use these cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer Websites and Services, track users’ movements around our Websites and Services, serve targeted advertisements and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. This section describes the types of Website Navigational Information used on the Company’s Websites and Services, and how this information may be used.</p>
<p><em>Log Files, IP Addresses, URLs and Other Data.</em><br/>As is true of most Company Websites, we gather certain information automatically to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the Company’s Websites and Services. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), device and application identification numbers, your location, your browser type, your Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your searches, your operating system and system configuration information, and date/time stamps associated with your usage. Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use the Company’s Websites and Services, we automatically receive the URL of the website from which you came and the website to which you go when you leave our Website. This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us improve our Websites and Services, to track and aggregate non-personal information, and to provide the Websites and Services. For example, the Company uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which customers and website visitors navigate the Company’s Websites. The Company also collects IP addresses from customers when they log into the Services as part of the Company’s “Identity Confirmation” and “IP Range Restrictions” security features.</p>
<p><em>Cookies.</em><br/> The Company uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Websites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company’s Websites, the Company’s servers send a cookie to your computer or device. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to the Company, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Request a Demo” or a “Request a Quote” Web form) or have previously identified yourself to the Company, you remain anonymous to the Company. The Company uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer or device when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer or device after you close your browser or turn off your computer. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on the Company’s Websites or Services.</p>
<p>The following sets out how the Company uses different categories of cookies.</p>
<p><em>Required Cookies:</em><br/>Required cookies enable you to navigate the Company’s Websites and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Websites and using the Company Services. If you have chosen to identify yourself to the Company, the Company may place on your browser cookies containing an encrypted, unique identifier. These cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Company’s Websites and Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Therefore, there is no option to opt out of these cookies because they are essential to operate the Websites.</p>
<p><em>Functionality Cookies:</em><br/>Functionality cookies allow the Company’s Websites and Services to remember information you have entered or choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies also enable you to optimize your use of the Company’s Websites and Services after logging in. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. Functional cookies may also be used to improve how the Company's Websites and Services function and perform, to enhance and customize your interactions with the Company, and to help us provide you with more relevant messages, including marketing communications. These cookies collect information about how website visitors use our Websites and Services, including which pages visitors go to most often and if they receive error messages from certain pages. The Company may use its own technology (under the Company brand name or an affiliated brand name) or third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from website visitors, attendees, and customers, to provide enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of the Company's advertisements. The Company and its third-party partners may also utilize HTML5 local storage or Flash cookies for these purposes. Flash cookies and HTML local storage are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. The Company also uses Flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on the Company Websites and Services to personalize your visit. In particular, we use Google Analytics (“Google Analytics”), a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how our websites are used, including the number of visitors, the websites from which visitors have navigated to our websites, and the pages on our websites to which visitors navigate. This information is used by us to improve the Company’s Websites. To opt out from data collection by Google Analytics, you can download and install a browser add-on, which is available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>. To learn how to control cookies via your individual browser settings, visit https://www.aboutcookies.org . To learn how to manage privacy and storage setting for Flash cookies, visit <a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.macromedia.com/</a>. Note that opting out of functional cookies may impact the functionality of our Websites and degrade your user experience.</p>
<p><em>Targeting or Advertising Cookies:</em><br/>The Company sometimes uses cookies delivered by third parties to show you ads for the Company products and services that we think may interest you on any devices you may use and to track the performance of the Company advertisements. For example, in these cases, cookies remember information such as which browsers have visited the Company’s Websites. The information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after the Company receives it. If the Company is using one of its own cookie-related products on our own Website, then a cookie related to ads may appear on our Website under the Company or one of our affiliated company's name. The Company also contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from Web beacons (see below) on the Company’s Websites and Services, from emails, and on third-party Websites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time and across different sites or other online services by collecting Website Navigational Information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. These technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use, such as a desktop or laptop computer, smartphone or tablet. Third parties use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other Websites or mobile applications on any of your devices. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Third parties, with whom the Company partners to provide certain features on our Websites or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. To manage the use of targeting or advertising cookies on the Websites, consult your individual browser settings for cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, click <a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.macromedia.com/</a><span>. </span>Various browsers may also offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 local storage.</p>
<p><em>Do Not Track.</em><br/>Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Websites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. The Company does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Websites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. The Company takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>
<p><em>Usage Data.</em><br/>As it is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically in connection with the use of the Website by individual users. This information may include IP address, device and application identification numbers, browser type, location, the pages and files viewed, operating system and system configuration information and date/time stamps associated with your usage. This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us provide and improve our Websites and to guarantee their security and continued proper functioning. In addition, we gather certain information automatically as part of your use of the Company cloud products and services, specifically for Assembla and Travis CI entities. This information may include IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, internet service provider, the pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you take, operating system and system configuration information and date/time stamps associated with your usage. This information is used to maintain the security of the Services, to provide necessary functionality, as well as to improve performance of the Services, to assess and improve customer and user experience of the Services, to review compliance with applicable usage terms, to identify future opportunities for development of the Services, to assess capacity requirements, to identify customer opportunities and for the security of the Company generally (in addition to the security of our products and Services). Some of the device and usage data collected within the Services, whether alone or in conjunction with other data, could be personally identifying to you. Please note that this usage data is primarily used for the purposes of identifying the uniqueness of each user logging on (as opposed to specific individuals), apart from where it is strictly required to identify an individual for security purposes or as required as part of our provision of the Services to our customers (where we act as a processor).</p>
<h3>8. Links to Other Websites and Public Forums</h3>
<p>Our Websites contain links to information on other websites. We do not have any control over these other websites, and therefore we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you provide while visiting those websites.

Portions of this website may also make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to visitors.

To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f794989a879b9e96999492b79e93928596d994989a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1b7874766b77727a75787e5b727f7e697a35787476">[email protected]</span></a>.</p>
<p>The Company’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, the Company remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless the Company proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, the Company commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union, United Kingdom, and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact the Company at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#791a161409151018171a1c39101d1c0b18571a1614" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="cfaca0a2bfa3a6aea1acaa8fa6abaabdaee1aca0a2">[email protected]</span></a>. The Company has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints covering non-Human Resource data under the Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU Privacy Shield, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive a timely acknowledgement of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please visit <a href="https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers</a> for more information or to file a complaint. The services of BBB EU Privacy Shield are provided at no cost to you.</p>
<p>Please note that the Company also receives some data via other compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
<p>If your complaint involves human resources data transferred to the United States from the EU, UK and/or Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship, and the Company does not address it satisfactorily, the Company commits to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPA Panel), the UK DPA Panel and/or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, as applicable and to comply with the advice given by the DPA panel and/or Commissioner, as applicable with regard to such human resources data. To pursue an unresolved human resources complaint, you should contact the state or national data protection or labor authority in the appropriate jurisdiction. Complaints related to human resources data should not be addressed to the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD. Contact details for the EU data protection authorities can be found at <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a></p>

<p>The Company is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission. The Company may be required to disclose personal information that we handle under the Privacy Shield in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<h3>11. Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5635393b263a3f37383533163f323324377835393b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4c2f23213c20252d222f290c2528293e2d622f2321">[email protected]</span></a> .</p>
<h3>12. How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>
<p>To exercise your rights, please contact us by using the information in the “Contacting us” section 17 below. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month and will contact you if we need additional information from you in order to honor your request. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month, taking into account the complexity and number of requests we receive. If you are an employee of the Company customer, we recommend you contact your company’s system administrator for assistance in correcting or updating your information. Some registered users may update their user settings, profiles, organization settings and event registrations by logging into their accounts and editing their settings or profiles.</p>
<p>As described above, we may also process Data submitted by or for a customer to our cloud products and services. To this end, if not stated otherwise in this Privacy Statement or in a separate disclosure, we process such Data in the role of a mere processor on behalf of a customer (and/or its affiliates) who is the responsible controller of the Data concerned. We are not responsible for and have no control over the privacy and data security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this Privacy Statement. If your data has been submitted to us by or on behalf a Company customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have under applicable data protection laws, please inquiry with the applicable customer directly. Because we may only access a customer’s data upon instruction from that customer, if you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide to us the name of the Company customer who submitted your data to us. We will refer your request to that customer, and will support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<h3>13. Retention Periods and Deletion</h3>
<p>The Company retains your personal information to the extent necessary to reasonably serve customer relations, to meet our compliance and legal obligations, to enhance security and fraud prevention, and for audit purposes. For example, we may retain your information during the time in which you have an account to use our Website or Services and for a reasonable period of time afterward. We may also retain your information during the period of time needed for the Company to pursue our legitim business interest, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We determine the appropriate retention period for the Data on the basis of the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Data processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Data and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).</p>
<p>When you decide to delete certain information in your account, we will fulfill your request and update this information on our platform. We will also notify third parties that we authorized the use and share that content of your request.</p>
<h3>14. Unsubscribe</h3>
<p>You may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of the Company’s marketing emails. Additionally, you may <a href="http://www2.wherescape.com/Unsubscribe.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unsubscribe here</a> or by contacting us at any time at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a1c2ceccd1cdc8c0cfc2c4e1c8c5c4d3c08fc2cecc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9bf8f4f6ebf7f2faf5f8fedbf2fffee9fab5f8f4f6">[email protected]</span></a> . Please note that opting out of marketing communications does not opt you out of receiving important business communications related to your current relationship with us, such as communications about your subscriptions or event registrations, service announcements or security information.</p>
<h3>15. Information about International Transfers</h3>
<p>The Company primarily stores Data about the Company’s customers and Data about attendees in the United States. To facilitate the Company’s global operations, the Company may transfer and access such information from around the world, including from other countries in which the Company has operations. A list of the Company’s global offices is available at http://www.ideracorp.com/contactus. This Privacy Statement shall apply even if the Company transfers Data about the Company customers or Data about attendees to other countries.</p>
<p>Your Data may be collected (e.g. if you are visiting our Websites), transferred to and stored by us in the United States and by our affiliates in other countries where we operate. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, but please be assured that the Company does take steps pursuant to the laws in the United States to ensure that your privacy is protected. In this event, we will ensure that the recipient of your Data offers an adequate level of protection, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art. 46 GDPR) or by ensuring the recipient is self-certify under the EU-US Privacy Shield, which you can read more about in section 10 above. By visiting our Website or using our Services, you understand that your information will be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>16. Changes to this Privacy Statement</h3>
<p>The Company reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements and other factors. If we do, we will update the “effective date” at the top of this Privacy Statement. If we make a material update, we may provide you with notice prior to the update taking effect, such as by posting a conspicuous notice on our website or by contacting you using the email address you provided.</p>
<p>We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement to stay informed about our collection, processing and sharing of your personal information.</p>
