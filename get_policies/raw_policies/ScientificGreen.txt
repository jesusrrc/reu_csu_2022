<li>CHILDREN UNDER 18:<strong> This website is not intended for sue by anyone under the age of 18. </strong>We encourage parents and guardians to supervise their child's use of the Internet. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information without a parent's or guardian's permission when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. In compliance with COPPA (the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), we have adopted the following policies to keep kids safe (there are exceptions to these policies as noted below): (a) We will NOT knowingly collect, use, or distribute personal information from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian. (b) Personal information we collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by us or our agents for internal purposes only and will NOT be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties. (c) We will NOT knowingly allow children under the age of 13 access to free form chat, message boards, email accounts, or other services within the Green Scientific Labs Website that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personal information without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian. (d) We will NOT knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any service. (e) We will NOT knowingly keep any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's email submission, help inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Any such information will be purged promptly after the issue has been resolved. (f) We will NOT knowingly post any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Upon notice to us, these submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter. (g) We will NOT knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens.

We will not use that information to re-contact the child for any other purpose (we will purge from our system the child's personal information after responding); (b) Collecting a child's contact information and the contact information of his/her parent or guardian solely to directly respond more than once to a specific request from the child. In this instance, the parent or guardian will be notified that the child made such a request and be informed of the information provided by the child. The parent or guardian will have an opportunity at any time to revoke the child's request. We will not use the child's personal information to re-contact the child for any other purpose.

A "persistent identifier" is a series of numbers that we assign to a user but cannot be reasonably used to identify a specific user. (d) A child may provide the email address of their parent or guardian for the purpose of retrieving or resetting a child's lost password for their user account. A parent or guardian's email address collected in this instance will only be used for this purpose.</p>

We want to be sure that consumers’ requests are honored until we’re told of a change.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
