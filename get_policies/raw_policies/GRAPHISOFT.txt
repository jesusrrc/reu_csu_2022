<h2>1. BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE DATA CONTROLLER</h2>
<h3>1.1 Data controller/processor</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy regulates the data processing by GRAPHISOFT, and it is therefore GRAPHISOFT who generally qualifies as data controller in respect of your personal data. There are however certain cases where GRAPHISOFT does not act as a data controller but instead acts as a subordinate of another data controller, which case GRAPHISOFT is understood to be a data processor (acting on behalf of another controller while processing the personal data – in such case GRAPHISOFT proceeds in accordance and based on the instructions of the data controller and processes data only to the extent as prescribed by the data controller).</p>
<p>Please also note that GRAPHISOFT operates and provides its services with close cooperation with its subsidiaries, distributors and resellers (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS”), therefore the electronic systems of GRAPHISOFT (where most of our products are marketed and are available) are designed to share the relevant information with GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS. Based on this system structure it may occur that the data processed by GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS are shared with GRAPHISOFT PARNTERS or GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS share personal information with GRAPHISOFT.</p>
<p>In all cases internal policies and procedures furthermore agreements regulate the access to the databases to ensure that while we aim to provide the best service possible all data processing are in compliance with the legal regulations.</p>

However, since GRAPHISOFT has always added considerable weight to the privacy of personal data, GRAPHISOFT appoints a data protection officer and dedicated sufficient staff, resources to ensure that it is able to discharge its obligations under the GDPR.</p>

<p>5.4 It is GRAPHISOFT’s legitimate interest to prevent and respond to fraud, to defend our Websites and applications against attacks, to protect the property and safety of GRAPHISOFT, our customers, users, the public. That is why GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS and specific companies are retained as data processors to assist us to combat piracy. Please note that it is GRAPHISOFT’s legitimate interest from the above reasons not to identify our service providers. We share Your IP address, MAC address, software version and language with them exclusively for the above purposes.</p>
<p>5.5 Further to the above as indicated earlier GRAPHISOFT provides its services in close cooperation with its subsidiaries therefore it is frequent that a GRAPHISOFT subsidiary acts as data processor on behalf of GRAPHISOFT.</p>
<h3><em>(B) DISCLOSURE TO OTHER DATA CONTROLLERS</em></h3>
<p>5.6 In other cases, we provide your data to other entities to use such data under their own name and for their own benefit. Sometimes we may need to do this to comply with a legal obligation (such as when we need to provide certain Transaction, Technical or Identify Data to the police or other authorities), and in other cases, we rely on other legal grounds, such as our legitimate interests or your written (including electronic means) consent.</p>
<p>5.7 Accordingly, if you consent to the sharing, as indicated above in the table, GRAPHISOFT may also share your Identity Data, Contact Data and Marketing and Communications Data with <a href="https://graphisoft.com/info/where_to_buy/" target="_blank">GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS</a>. Please note that we do not share your personal data for their own marketing purposes unless the consumer agreed to that sharing.</p>
<p>5.8 We may share or publish Aggregate Data that doesn’t specifically identify you, such as statistical information about visitors to our websites or statistical information about how customers use our applications.</p>
<p>5.9 We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law and the data processing contract if any. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<h3><em>(C) MAKING YOUR DATA PUBLICLY AVAILABLE BY YOU</em></h3>
<p>5.10 There are several places on GRAPHISOFT’s websites and applications that allow you to post comments, upload pictures, or submit content for others to see. Sometimes you might be able to limit who can see what you share, but there are some places where what you share can be seen by the general public or other members of the website or application. Please be careful when you share your personal information. Do not share anything you do not want publicly known unless you are sure you are posting it within a website or application that allows you to control who sees your post. Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and applications, your email address or name may be included and displayed with your message.</p>
<p>5.11 To remove content you have shared on our websites and applications, please use the same website or application feature you used to share the content. If another user invites you to participate in shared viewing, editing, or commenting of content, you may be able to delete your contributions, but usually the user who invited you has full control. If you have questions or concerns about this, please <a href="mailto:privacy@graphisoft.com">contact us</a>.</p>
<h2>6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h2>
<p>6.1 As indicated above, we share your personal data within the GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>You provide us with certain personal data when registering at our Websites. In such case, if you consent to the sharing, as indicated above in the table, GRAPHISOFT as data controller may also share your Identity Data, Contact Data and Marketing and Communications Data with <a href="https://graphisoft.com/info/where_to_buy/" target="_blank">GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS</a> too.</li>
<li>GRAPHISOFT PARTNERS use the online ordering system of GRAPHISOFT and when using it may fill in certain personal information about you. This is always the decision of the given GRAPHISOFT PARTNER. In such case the GRAPHISOFT PARTNER is the data controller and GRAPHISOFT is only data processor of the partner in order to provide the electronic ordering system.</li>
</ol>
<p>These transfers will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (<b>EEA</b>).</p>
<p>6.2 Also, since many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (<b>EEA</b>) (such as Microsoft, Inc., Digital Ocean, Inc., Salesforce.com, Inc.), so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
<p>6.3 Whenever we transfer your personal data outside of EEA, we contractually ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en" target="_blank">European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries</a>.</li>
<li>(b) where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en" target="_blank">European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries</a>.</li>
<li>(c) where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en" target="_blank">European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>6.4 Please do contact us if you need further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data outside of EEA.</p>
<h2>7. IS MY PERSONAL DATA SECURE, AND WHERE WILL IT BE STORED?</h2>
<p>7.1 We understand that the security of your personal information is important. We provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your personal information. All information you provide us is stored on secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot warrant or guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. In case your data is provided by registering on our websites than we ensure that this registration is completed on a secured platform where we apply our security measures. In case you would like to have more information on the specific security measures taken in order to save your data than please contact us.</p>
<p>7.2 Also, we have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>7.3 Finally, we have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<p>7.4 Your personal information and data files are stored on GRAPHISOFT’s servers and the servers of companies we hire to provide services to us. As shown in clause 6 above, your personal information may be transferred across national borders because we have servers located worldwide and the companies we hire to help us run our business are located in different countries around the world (for example, Germany, Ireland, the United States). As mentioned in clause 6 above, the data that we collect from you may therefore be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order and the provision of support services.</p>
<h2>8. HOW LONG WILL GRAPHISOFT HOLD AND USE MY PERSONAL DATA?</h2>
<p>8.1 We only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>8.2 To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we take into account the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>8.3 More specifically, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for at least 5, in certain cases 8 years after they cease being customers for tax, financial auditing, and record keeping purposes.</p>
<p>8.4 In some applicable circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see the clause dealing with ‘Right To Erasure’ below for further information.</p>
<p>8.5 In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

<h3>9.5 Your right to data portability</h3>
<p><b>Where the processing of your data is either based on your consent (e.g. in respect of electronic direct marketing), or is necessary for the performance of a contract (e.g. customer registration data and data relating to your orders), and the processing is carried out by automated means, than you may request the provision of your personal data that you have provided to us in a standard format, and you may also request that such data be transferred to another entity.</b></p>
<p>Without prejudice to your rights above, you have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you provided to GRAPHISOFT, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance (where technically feasible) from GRAPHISOFT, where the processing is based on your consent, or is necessary for the performance of a contract, and the processing is carried out by automated means.</p>

<p><b>Importantly, when we process your data on the basis of our legitimate interests as indicated in the above table, you may object to such processing and request that any of those activities be stopped. Similarly, you may opt-out of any of our direct marketing activities at any time by contacting GRAPHISOFT’s Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@graphisoft.com">privacy@graphisoft.com</a>, by adjusting your preferences in the privacy dashboard provided as part of some of our services (e.g.“<a href="https://graphisoftid.graphisoft.com/#/profile" target="_blank">my profile</a>”), or by using the ‘unsubscribe’ function at the end of our messages.</b></p>
<h3>9.7 Your rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling</h3>
<p><b>You have the right to request not to be the subject of automated decision-making including profiling where the decision produces legal effects or equally has a significant effect on you, and can insist on human intervention where appropriate.</b></p>
<p>There are exceptions to this right, which are, if the decision:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Is necessary for concluding or performing a contract</li>
<li>Is authorised by law</li>
<li>Is based on the data subject’s explicit consent</li>
</ol>
<h3>9.8 Your right to withdraw consent</h3>
<p><b>Also, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time where we rely on your consent for processing your data (e.g. for certain electronic direct marketing purposes). You may do this at any time by contacting GRAPHISOFT’s Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@graphisoft.com">privacy@graphisoft.com</a>, by adjusting your preferences in the privacy dashboard provided as part of some of our services (e.g.“<a href="https://graphisoftid.graphisoft.com/#/profile" target="_blank">my profile</a>”), or by using the ‘unsubscribe’ function at the end of our messages. Remember that the withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal and that in some cases we may need time to process request.</b></p>
<p>GRAPHISOFT shall, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to communicate your objection/withdrawal of consent to recipients of such personal data (if any). However, GRAPHISOFT shall not communicate such restriction to recipients if the communication to such recipients is either impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.</p>
<h3>9.9 Your right to lodge a complaint</h3>
<p>Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy that you may have (such as the right to claim compensation for damages suffered as a result of GRAPHISOFT’s breach of the GDPR), you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Hungarian Data Protection and Freedom of Information Authority (<b>NAIH</b>) supervisory authority, or another data protection supervisory authority in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR.</p>
<p>The contact details of the NAIH are as follows: H-1055 Budapest, Falk Miksa utca 9-11; 1363 Budapest, Pf. 9; phone: +36 1 391-1400; telefax: +36 1 391-1410; e-mail: <a href="mailto:ugyfelszolgalat@naih.hu">ugyfelszolgalat@naih.hu</a>; website: www.naih.hu.</p>
<p>In any case, we would highly appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the regulatory authority above, so please contact us in the first instance if you have any problems.</p>
<h3>9.10 Restrictions on the above rights</h3>
<p>Please be advised that based on GDPR Member States are allowed to restrict by way of a legislative measure the scope of the rights you may have as per the above. In case such restriction is applicable in your respect, we will advise you accordingly when you contact us on exercising any of your above rights.</p>
<h3>9.11 Contact details</h3>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of your rights mentioned above, please contact us at the addresses set out in clause 1.2 above.</p>
<h3>9.12 No fee usually required</h3>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a fee of EUR 30 or in equivalent local currency, if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<h3>9.13 Verification of your identify</h3>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
