<p><em>This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 25, 2018</em></p>
<p>Clarive Software S.L. provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our website at https://clarive.com (including all subdomains, the “Website”) and our software-as-a-service platform (the “Service”) of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal data and other information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect when you use the Website and/or the Service, why we collect the data, how it is used and your rights and choices.</p>
<p>By using or accessing the Website or the Service and providing us with your Personal Data, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy, and you are consenting to our processing of your data as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us (for information on how we may change our Privacy Policy, please read the “Privacy Policy Changes” section below). If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your Personal Data, please contact us.</p>
<p>We perform personalized advertising for our products and services using AdRoll. For more information, please read <a href="https://www.adrollgroup.com/privacy">AdRoll’s Service Privacy Notice </a></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Information We Collect And How We Use It</h4>
<h5>I. Personal Data That You Provide To Us</h5>
<p>When you interact with the Website or the Service, Clarive may gather information that, alone or in combination with other information, could be used to identify you (“Personal Data”), as described below. If you are an EU data subject, please see the “EU Data Subject” section below for information on your rights in relation to the Personal Data we hold about you.</p>
<p>a) Personal Data used to provide the Service and respond to requests<br/>
When users sign up for the Service, users are required to authenticate with their version control system identity (GitHub or Bitbucket). When users log in to the Service using sign-in services (for example, login with a GitHub account), these services will authenticate a user’s identity and provide the user with the option to share certain Personal Data, such as name and email address(es), with us. If you purchase one of our paid plans, we will also collect payment and billing information such as credit card details and billing address. We use this data to provide you with access to the Service and/or the Website, contact you regarding your access and use of the Service and/or the Website or to notify you of important changes to the Service. For EU data subjects, such use is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us.</p>
<p>On some sections of the Website, you may complete a web form to give your Personal Data to us directly, such as on our “Contact Us” page. We also collect Personal Data (such as your name and contact details, phone number) when you request information, including a product demo, ask to download content (such as white papers), register for a webinar or other event, or subscribe to email lists. We will use your contact information to respond to your request. For EU data subjects, such use is necessary to respond to or implement your request. If you send us a request or question regarding the use of the Service (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we may publish it (in anonymous form only) in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</p>
<p>Clarive collects Personal Data that you provide through the Service only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with Clarive, such as providing you with the Service and/or answering any requests regarding the Service as described above. You can always refuse to supply Personal Data, however doing so may prevent you from accessing the Service or engaging in certain activities on the Website or the Service.</p>
<p>b) Personal Data used to process applications for employment<br/>
When you submit a job application through the Website, we will collect your resume and any additional information that you elect to provide to us, including but not limited to employment history and education. We will use your contact details and data about your employment history and education to conduct job interviews, evaluate your application, and as is otherwise needed for recruitment. For EU data subjects, this use is necessary to respond to your request to process your application for employment.</p>
<p>c) Personal Data used for marketing<br/>
We will use your email to tell you about your Service usage, new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Clarive and our products, upcoming events or other promotions. If you change your mind about receiving information from us or about the use of information volunteered by you, please send us a request specifying your new choice. Please contact us as specified under the “Get in Touch” section. You may also choose to opt out of receiving such emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, or by accessing the email preferences in your account settings page. If you download content from the Website, we may also use your phone number to contact you directly by phone, in connection with such new products and services, upcoming events or other promotions.</p>
<p>Where required by applicable law (for example, if you are an EU data subject), we will only send you marketing information by email or mail, or contact you by phone, if you consent to us doing so. When you provide us with your consent to be contacted for marketing purposes, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by following the instructions to “opt-out” of receiving marketing communication in each marketing email we send you. In addition, if at any time you do not wish to receive future marketing communications or wish to have your name deleted from our mailing or calling lists, please contact us at <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="87eae6f5ece2f3eee9e0c7e4ebe6f5eef1e2a9e4e8eaa9" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a> Please note that if you opt out from marketing communications, we may still contact you regarding issues related to our Service and to respond to your requests.</p>
<h5>II. Automatically Collected Information</h5>
<p>Like most hosted service operators, Clarive collects information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site and the date and time of each visitor request and store it in log files. Clarive also collects Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, which can be used to identify the location from which your computer is connecting to the Website, for providing the Service and for support purposes.</p>
<p>Clarive also collects statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Website and the Service through cookies and similar technologies. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in the “Cookies” section below. Clarive’s purpose in collecting such information is to better understand how Clarive’s visitors use the Website and the Service and to improve your access to and use of the Website and the Service.</p>
<p>Use of such automatically collected information is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us, to the extent we process information that is needed for providing the Service and for support purposes, or is in our legitimate interest in understanding how the Service is being used by you and enhancing your experience on our Website and on the Service.</p>
<h5>III. Information We Process On Behalf Of Our Customers</h5>
<p>In providing the Service to our customers, we process on behalf of customers certain information that may include Personal Data, relating to customers’ employees, contractors or other users (“Users”) they transmit or otherwise submit to our Service. While our customers or Users decide what data to submit, this information typically includes email address and information relating to tests results.<br/>

Clarive will not disclose individual metric or usage data other than in an aggregated and de-identified form. For EU data subjects, this use of your Personal Data is necessary for our legitimate interests in understanding how the Service is being used by you and to improve your experience on it.</p>
<p><strong>Data Retention</strong><br/>
We will retain Personal Data that our customers provide to us through the Service for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

<p><strong>Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms</strong><br/>
If you submit a post or participate in a discussion on a bulletin board or chat room on the Website or the Service, you should be aware that any Personal Data you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Data you choose to submit in these forums.</p>

When a cookie is dropped into your browser, they do not collect any information from you, the visitor. A cookie is only used to track the visitor’s browsing behavior which will help them serve the right adverts to you at the right time.</p>
<p>AdRoll does not save any information regarding visitors using the SmartPixel cookie; the data they do collect includes:</p>

<p>– This data may be used by third parties to target advertising on other sites based on your online activity.</p>
<p>We do not disclose or share any of your personal data with AdRoll.</p>
<p>You may opt out of receiving targeted advertising at any time using one or more of the following options:</p>
<p>– Clicking on the blue icon that typically appears in the corner of the adverts or by using the <a href="https://www.adrollgroup.com/privacy">AdRoll Cookie Opt Out</a> </p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn Conversion Tracking and Insight Tag</strong></p>
<p>The LinkedIn Insight Tag is a piece of lightweight JavaScript code that we have added to our websites to enable in-depth campaign reporting and to help us unlock valuable insights about our website visitors. We use the LinkedIn Insight Tag to track conversions, retarget website visitors, and unlock additional insights about members interacting with our LinkedIn adverts.</p>
<p>The LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of metadata such as IP address information, timestamp, and events such as page views. All data is encrypted. The LinkedIn browser cookie is stored in a visitor’s browser until they delete the cookie or the cookie expires (there’s a rolling six-month expiration from the last time the visitor’s browser loaded the Insight Tag).</p>
<p>You can opt out of cookies from LinkedIn on your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/">LinkedIn settings page</a> and recommend you read their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a> for more information.</p>
