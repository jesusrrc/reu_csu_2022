<h3 class="c81head">5. WHY AND HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
<p>We may use personal information for the following business purposes:</p>
<ul class="obullets" style="margin-left:40px;">
<li>to communicate and respond to your requests and inquiries to Oracle;</li>
<li>to create and administer an Oracle single sign-on (SSO) account (also referred to as an âOracle Accountâ) and to deliver functionality on our sites and for their technical and functional management;</li>
<li>to engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners and to process orders for Oracle products and services;</li>

<ul class="obullets" style="margin-left:40px;">
<li>to administer subscriptions of Oracle publications and newsletters;</li>
<li>to market our products and services or related products and services, and to tailor our marketing and sales activities to your or your companyâs interests; and</li>
<li>to provide select business-to-business services to Oracle customers using publicly available information about companies which may include personal information such as  the name of a companyâs CEO that is publicly available.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>These purposes are described below in further detail. </p>
<p><strong>To communicate and respond to your requests and inquiries to Oracle</strong></p>
<p>If you get in touch with us (such as by submitting contact forms on our sites, reaching out to us via Oracle Sales chat, attending Oracle events or other occasions, sending an email or by visiting social media platforms), we process information about you to communicate with you and to respond to your requests or other inquiries. We can also process personal information to interact with you on third party social networks. </p>
<p><strong>To create an Oracle SSO account and deliver functionality on our sites and for their technical and functional management</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to register with us (such as to make use of our communities), we need to process the personal information provided by you so that we can create an Oracle account for you. Please note, this only applies to personal information controlled by Oracle, not personal information Oracle processes on behalf of our customers. </p>
<p><strong>To engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners and to process purchases of our products and services</strong></p>
<p>If you place an order for our products and services, or if you provide services to Oracle, our employees, customers or partners as a supplier or business partner, Oracle processes information about you to engage in and administer the relevant transactions (such as by sending invoices and making payments), administer your order, and help you get started and adopt our products and services (e.g., by contacting you to activate your Cloud services credits). If you download products or services from our sites, Oracle uses information about you to confirm certain information about your order (for example, that you did not experience problems in the download process). </p>
<p><strong>To analyze, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services</strong></p>
<p>We may process personal information in order to analyze, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services, including for quality assurance and training purposes, as well as for marketing and sales campaigns. This includes processing personal information to conduct surveys to improve Oracle products and services. In case the sites permit you to participate in interactive discussions, create a profile, post comments, opportunities or other content, or communicate directly with another user or otherwise engage in networking activities on Oracle sites, Oracle may process personal information when moderating these activities.</p>
<p><strong>To manage the security of our sites, facilities, networks and systems</strong></p>
<p>We may collect site use data for security and operations management to help keep our sites, facilities, networks and systems secure, or to investigate and prevent potential fraud, including ad fraud and cyber-attacks and to detect bots.</p>
<p><strong>To comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, we have to process personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For example, to respond to a request from a regulator or to defend a legal claim. We may also process personal information in the performance and operation of our business, such as to conduct internal audits and investigations or for finance and accounting and archiving and insurance purposes.</p>
<p><strong>To administer subscriptions of Oracle publications and newsletters</strong></p>
<p>If you subscribe to our magazines (such as âOracleâ or âProfitâ), we process information about you to administer your subscription to our magazines (including the renewal process) and newsletters.</p>
<p><strong>To market our products, services, events, or related products and services and to tailor marketing and sales activities</strong></p>
<p>Oracle may use information about you to notify you about new product releases and service developments, events, alerts, updates, prices, terms, special offers and associated campaigns and promotions (including via newsletters). Oracle may also use personal information to advertise Oracleâs products and services or related products and services, and also to have our distributors, resellers or partners notify you about our products or services or their related products or services (such as via joint sales or product promotions). We do our best to tailor your website visit, marketing experience and our communications to your expressed interests. This happens, for example, if you sign up for an Oracle community or program like the Oracle Partner Network or Oracle Technology Network.</p>
<p>If you attend an event, Oracle may process information about you gathered in relation to the event and can share information about your attendance with your company. Oracle may also permit designated event partners or conference sponsors to send you up to two communications related to your event attendance. Please note that our partners or conference sponsors may directly request information about you at their conference booths or presentations, and their use of your information that you provide to them will be subject to their privacy policies.</p>
<p>We may also process your personal information to post testimonials on our sites, but will first obtain your consent to use your name and testimonial. </p>
<p><strong>To provide select services to Oracle customers using publicly-available information which may include personal information such as the name of a companyâs CEO</strong></p>
<p>For some business-to-business services, we may collect the publicly available names of company directors and officials to better understand the status of these companies and help inform our services which relate to providing customers information about other companies.</p>
<a class="atarget" id="6" name="6"></a>
<h3 class="c81head">6. WHAT IS OUR BASIS FOR PROCESSING INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?</h3>
<p>For personal information collected about you in the EU/EEA, the UK and other relevant jurisdictions, our basis for processing is the following:</p>
<ul class="obullets" style="margin-left:40px;">
<li>We rely on our <strong>legitimate interest</strong> in processing contact and related information about you in order to communicate adequately with you and to respond to your requests.</li>
<li>In order to engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners, and to process purchases and downloads of our products and services, we need to process information about you <strong>as necessary to enter into or perform a contract</strong> with you.</li>
<li>We process personal information for marketing and sales activities (including events) based on your <strong>consent</strong> where so indicated on our sites at the time your personal information was collected, or further to our <strong>legitimate interest</strong> to keep you updated on developments around our products and services which may be of interest to you.</li>
<li>We rely on our <strong>legitimate interest</strong> to analyze, develop, improve and optimize our sites, facilities, products and services, and to maintain the security of our sites, networks and systems.</li>

<li>Contact information such as your email address or phone number collected online on our sites or offline from our interactions with you at Oracle events and conferences, and used for direct marketing and sales activities will be retained for as long as we have an active (customer) relationship with you. We treat you as an active contact if (i) you have interacted with Oracle or updated your contact details and preferences in the past 18 months; and (ii) you have not made a deletion request.</li>
<li>If you have reached out to us via Oracle Sales chat, we will delete all chat transcripts 90 days after the chat has concluded.</li>
