Unfortunately, there is not yet an adopted standard for how to respond to these signals. SAILDRONE does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third-party sites do keep track of Your browsing activities when they serve YOU content, which enables them to tailor what they present to YOU. If YOU are visiting such sites, Safari, a feature that allows iOS users the ability to limit targeting and tracking of web browsing behavior by various web services, allows YOU to set the DNT signal on Your browser, so that third parties know YOU do not want to be tracked.  If YOU would like to learn how to set Safari so that websites do not track YOU, go here:<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074#iOS">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074#iOS</a></p><p class="info-text">Third parties that have content embedded in the iOS environment and websites such as a social feature or a stock ticker may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited a specific iOS website from a certain IP address. Third parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from Apple’s websites, unless YOU provide it to them directly.<br/></p><h3 class="info-title">NOTICE FOR MINORS</h3><p class="info-text">SAILDRONE adheres to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, but does not collect personal information from minors under the age of 16. SAILDRONE offers interactive services which allow YOU to post content to share publicly or with friends.  At any time, YOU can delete or remove content YOU have posted using the deletion or removal options within our services.  If YOU have questions about how to remove content in a specific service or if YOU would like additional assistance with deletion, YOU can contact SAILDRONE’s Support Team directly at privacysupport@saildrone.com</p><h3 class="info-title">SECURITY</h3><p class="info-text">We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of Your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve the Service. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.<br/></p><p class="info-text">This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information from residents of the United States. If YOU are accessing the Services from outside the United States, please be aware that Your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated.

Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that Your privacy is protected. By using the Services, YOU understand that Your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties, with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.<br/><br/></p><h3 class="info-title">EFFECTIVE DATE &amp; CHANGES</h3><p class="info-text">This Privacy Policy is effective 14 December, 2018.<br/></p><p class="info-text">This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.
