<p> </p><h3><a name="_Toc465674442">How does LivePerson Automotive use the information it collects about me?</a></h3>
<p>We use the information we collect to provide and improve our services. We process your information if you have given your consent; if it's necessary to perform a contract with you or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract; if it's necessary to comply with legal obligations; or if it's necessary for us or a third party (such as a brand) to pursue a legitimate interest.</p>
<p>If you engage with a brand that uses our Services, we use the information we collect on behalf of and as directed by the brand.  For example, we may use your information to determine whether to deploy a chat button to allow the brand to engage with you or to deploy content, such as a banner offering a coupon, on your browser.</p>

<ul>

<li>To deliver marketing or other materials to you,</li>
<li>For promotions you may enter into, or</li>
<li>If you submit a resume or CV, to considering you for employment with LivePerson Automotive.</li>
</ul>
<p>LivePerson Automotive may retain your information for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection. For example, if you engage with a brand that uses our Services, we may retain your information for the period of time agreed on with the brand. We may also retain your information during the period of time needed for LivePerson Automotive to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p> </p><h3><a name="_Toc465674443">Does LivePerson Automotive use cookies?</a></h3>
<p>We may use cookies and other identification technologies for record keeping purposes and to enhance your experience, if you choose to visit our websites  </p>
<p>Cookies:<br/>
Cookies are small text files stored on a visitor’s web browser and applications. Cookies are often used to make web-browsing easier by performing functions such as saving passwords and maintaining lists of personal preferences regarding the use of the website.</p>
<p>Our websites, apps and Services may use the following types of cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strictly Necessary Cookies – these cookies are essential to enable you to browse our websites, apps and Services and use the available features.</li>
<li>Performance Cookies – these cookies collect information about how you use our websites, apps and Services. For instance, these cookies track which pages you visit most. This data may be used to help optimize our websites, apps and Services and make it easier for you to navigate within them. These cookies do not collect information that identifies you; all information is aggregated and anonymous.</li>
<li>Functionality Cookies – these cookies allow our websites, apps and Services to remember choices you make while browsing, such as geographic location and preferences such as text size and fonts. The information collected by these cookies will not personally identify you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other identification technologies that may be used by LivePerson Automotive websites, apps and Services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pixel tags (also called beacons or pixels) – these are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a webpage or application, which can retrieve certain information about your device and browser, including device type, operating system, browser type and version, website visited, time of visit, referring website, IP address and other similar information.</li>
<li>Software Development Kits (also called SDKs) - function like pixels and cookies, but operate in the mobile application context where pixels and cookies cannot always function. The application developer can install pieces of code (the SDK) into the application to collect certain information about user interaction with the application and information about the user device and network information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Third-party technologies:</p>
<p>LivePerson Automotive may use third-party service providers who are authorized to place cookies, pixel tags or similar technologies on our websites, apps and Services with our permission.   These technologies help us compile metrics and analytics (without collecting personally identifiable information) to help improve our websites, apps and Services.    Third-party cookies and technologies are covered by the third party’s privacy policy. </p>
<p>Your choice:</p>
<p>Web browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you prefer not to receive cookies, you typically have the option of setting your browser to refuse cookies. If your browser is set to refuse cookies, it is likely that some of the functionality offered by LivePerson Automotive will not be available or will not work as effectively for you. </p>
<p>For further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, you can visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and<a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p>
<p>Do Not Track</p>
<p>Various browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari, currently offer a "do not track" or "DNT" option that relies on a technology that sends a signal to websites a user visits about that user’s browser DNT preferences. While LivePerson Automotive attempts to honor the DNT instructions received from a user’s browser, LivePerson Automotive cannot guarantee that it will always respond to such signals because a common industry standard for DNT has not been adopted. LivePerson Automotive will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology.</p>
<p> </p><h3><a name="_Toc465674444">Sharing of information collected</a></h3>
<p>LivePerson Automotive does not sell, trade or rent personal information provided by you in any transcript, survey or recording for direct marketing or any other purpose, except as provided in this privacy policy or with your permission.  LivePerson Automotive does not disclose the contents of transcripts, surveys or recordings other than to service providers performing services on behalf of LivePerson Automotive, other than as provided in this privacy policy or with your permission.</p>

<p>We may aggregate information so that it is not personally identifiable and use and share such aggregated information for training and quality assurance purposes and to deliver and improve our Services.</p>
<p><em>Service providers</em></p>
<p>We use a limited number of third-party service providers to assist us in making our websites and Services available to visitors and users.

<p><em>Business partners</em></p>
<p>From time to time, we may partner with other companies to allow <a href="/">LivePerson Automotive</a> and its customers to offer integrations with our Services. If you engage with a brand that uses one of these integrations,<a href="/">LivePerson Automotive</a> may share your data with the third-party partner, receive data about you from the third-party partner, and/or combine third-party partner data about you with information about you that we collect.

<p> </p><h3><a name="_Toc465674445">Access and changes to personal data</a></h3>
<p>If you elect to engage in any communication or engagement session with LivePerson Automotive or a customer that uses our Services, it is up to you to decide what, if any, information to provide during such session.   Depending on your request, it may not be possible for us or our customer to address all of your questions without further information from you.  Nevertheless, if you do not wish to provide certain information, then you should not do so.   </p>
<p><a name="_Toc465674446">Third-party integrations</a></p>

<p> </p><h3><a name="_Toc465674448">How does LivePerson Automotive keep my information secure?</a></h3>
<p>We use security measures designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.    For certain LivePerson Automotive Services, chat/messaging transcripts are encrypted during transmission.   In addition, transcripts that we store are maintained and archived on secure, hardened servers that are hosted on highly secure data centers. Access to this data is protected by multiple layers of controls, including firewalls, role-based access controls, authentication mechanisms and monitoring. Data is backed up, and archives are stored off-site in a secure location.</p>
<p>If you are communicating with a brand that uses our Services, you should review the privacy practices of that brand to understand which security measures they use.  </p>
