Softing wishes to inform you about the items of data that are collected when visiting our website, and how we process and utilize this data.</p><h3>1. Responsible party</h3><p>The responsible party in the sense of data protection legislation comprises Softing AG, Softing Automotive Electronics GmbH, Softing Industrial Automation GmbH, and Softing IT Networks GmbH insofar as the aforementioned companies collect, process or utilize data.</p><h3>2. Consent</h3><p>By using our website, you agree to our Conditions of Use, and also to the collection, processing and use of your data as explained in the text that follows. This Privacy Policy is updated regularly and modified as required to comply with changes to data protection legislation. You should therefore visit this page regularly in order to keep yourself informed of the current state of our Privacy Policy.</p><h3>3. Types of information</h3><h4>3.1 Non-personal data</h4><p>Personal data explicitly permits inferences to be made about a specific person. This category includes such details as the company, name, date of birth, address, telephone number and email address of visitors to our website.</p><p>Softing collects, processes and utilizes personal data only in accordance with applicable data protection legislation. Data is transferred to third parties only if this is permissible according to the law.</p><h4>3.1.1 Use of cookies</h4><p>We use cookies to make your visit to our website even more attractive. Cookies are small text files which are stored on your computer and enable us to recognize your browser. With the help of cookies, we can improve the comfort and the quality of the services provided on the website.</p><p>Cookies are also used to analyze the use of the website, in particular online advertising, in anonymized or pseudonymized form, to store general preferences of a user and to present to the respective user, on the basis of his / her preferences, special offers and services which are of interest to him / her on the website.</p><p>When you log in to the customer login area with your user name, we set up a "session cookie", which allows us to identify you for the duration of your visit. You can save this session cookie permanently for the purpose of a future automatic login with the function "Remember login". The session cookie then contains parts of your logon data in encrypted form.</p><p>You can restrict or disable the use of cookies in your browser settings at any time. A use of our offers is also possible without cookies. However, this may result in certain limitations to the functionality and usability of our offer.</p><h4>3.1.2. Google Analytics and Google Maps</h4><p>These websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland ("Google"). The information generated by the cookies used about your visit to our website is usually transferred to Google servers in Europe and stored there. In some cases, however, a transfer and storage on servers in the USA is not excluded. IP anonymisation is activated on all company websites so that the IP address of users is shortened beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases the full IP address is transmitted to a Google server in Europe or the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating the use of the website by you, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. Further information on the handling of user data can be found in Google's privacy policy and terms of use: <span class="download extern"><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US</a></span> and <span class="download extern"><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US</a></span> .</p><p>Cookies from Google Analytics are only set on these websites if you consent to the use of cookies for analysis purposes in the cookie banner. If you do not give your consent, you may not be able to use all the functions of these websites to their full extent. You also have the option to prevent the collection and processing of data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: <span class="download extern"><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></span>.</p><p>This website uses the map service Google Maps via an API. The provider is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.<br/> To use the functions of Google Maps, it is necessary to save your IP address. This information is usually transferred to a Google server in Europe and stored there. However, Google does not exclude the possibility of transfer to servers in the USA. The provider of this site has no influence on this data transmission.<br/> The use of Google Maps is in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online offers and an easy location of the places indicated by us on the website. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) f GDPR.</p><p>More information on the handling of user data can be found in Google's privacy policy: <span class="download extern"><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US</a></span>.</p><h4>3.1.3 Talention Analytics</h4><p>This website uses the program Talention Analytics, which serves the analysis of page views and page visitors.

                    If Tracking Opt-in preferences is enabled, the pi_opt_in cookie is set with a true or false value when the visitor opts in or out of tracking. If a visitor opts in, the value is set to true, and the visitor is cookied and tracked. If the visitor opts out or ignores the opt-in banner, the opt-in cookie value is set to false. The visitor cookie is disabled, and the visitor is not tracked.

                    The visitor hash cookie contains the account ID and stores a unique hash. For example, the cookie name visitor_id12345-hash stores the hash â855c3697d9979e78ac404c4ba2c66533â, and the account ID is 12345. This cookie is a security measure to make sure that a malicious user canât fake a visitor from Pardot and access corresponding prospect information.
