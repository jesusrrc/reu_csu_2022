                                collected at the time of the sale. If you are required by

                                you must provide Sturfee with an official tax receipt or other
                                appropriate documentation to support such withholding.

<u>Miscellaneous</u>. You may not assign this Agreement without the
                        prior written consent of Sturfee, whether expressly or by operation
                        of law, including in connection with a merger or change of
                        control,
                        and any such attempted assignment shall be void and of no effect. We
                        may assign this Agreement, including our assets, technology,
                        intellectual property rights and data, whether owned or licensed by
                        us, without restriction and without any notice to you. Subject to
                        the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding on the parties and
                        their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement
                        shall be governed in all respects by California law, excluding any
                        conflict of laws principles that would require the application of
                        the laws of another jurisdiction. You hereby submit to the personal
                        jurisdiction of the state and federal courts for Santa Clara County,
                        California. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
                        invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction,
                        such provision will be deemed modified so as to be valid and
                        enforceable to the greatest extent possible under applicable law,
                        and the validity of the remaining provisions hereof shall not be
                        affected thereby. No course of
                        performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade will override the
                        written terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree
                        that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to obligate
                        Sturfee to provide the Sturfee VPS. The failure to exercise, or
                        delay in exercising, a right, power or remedy provided in this
                        Agreement or by law shall not constitute a waiver of that right,
                        power or remedy. Sturfee’s waiver of any obligation or breach of
                        this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any other obligation
                        or subsequent breach of this Agreement. The English language version
                        of this Agreement shall be the official and controlling version, and
                        any translation provided is solely for convenience. The Sturfee VPS
                        is a "Commercial Item" as that term is defined at 48
                        C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer Software."
                        If and to the extent the Sturfee VPS or license thereof is supplied
                        to or purchased by or on behalf of a United States government entity
                        or an entity licensing the Sturfee VPS for or on behalf of a United
                        States government entity, the Sturfee VPS is licensed (a) only as a
                        Commercial Item and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all
                        other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
                        Agreement. This
                        Agreement does not create or intend any third party beneficiary
                        rights in any individual or entity that is not a party to this
                        Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.
                        This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
                        between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof and
                        supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings,
                        and communications, whether written or oral. The term “including”
                        means “including without limitation”.</p>
