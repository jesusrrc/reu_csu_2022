<p>iii. Where You have objected to the processing (where it was necessary for the performance of a public

<p>c. direct marketing (including profiling); or </p>

<p>If You make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless We can demonstrate
                compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override Your interests, rights and freedoms, or the
                processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. </p>

                data is: i. consent; or ii. that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which You
                are party or in order to take steps at Your request prior to entering into a contract and iii. such
                processing is carried out by automated means, You have the right to receive Your personal data from Us in a
                structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would
