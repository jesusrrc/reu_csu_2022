<p class="sc-dVhcbM dEMqHK"><strong>1.1</strong> UAB “Belela“ ("Monolith", "we", "our" or "us") are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This privacy policy sets out how we collect, store, process, transfer, share and use data that identifies or is associated with you ("personal information").</p>
<p class="sc-dVhcbM dEMqHK"><strong>1.2</strong> Monolith may collect personal information about you when:</p>
<ul>
<li>you use our platform, which is accessible through the Monolith Wallet, that allows users to carry out and manage cryptoasset transactions and transactions they make with a pre-paid debit Monolith TokenCard provided by us (the "Monolith TokenCard"); and</li>
<li>when you apply for a pre-paid debit card which you can manage through the Monolith Wallet (the "Monolith TokenCard");</li>
<li>when you make payments through the Monolith Wallet, such as when you buy cryptoassets or, if you have applied for and received a Monolith TokenCard, when you top up the balance of the account linked to your Monolith TokenCard (your "Monolith Account"), or if you use the Monolith Wallet to view the balance of your Monolith Account (together, the "Monolith Services").</li>
</ul>
<p class="sc-dVhcbM dEMqHK"><strong>1.3</strong> Before accessing or using the Monolith Wallet or the Monolith Services, or applying for a Monolith TokenCard, please ensure that you have read and understood how we collect, store, use and disclose your personal information as described in this privacy policy.</p>
<p class="sc-dVhcbM dEMqHK"><strong>1.4</strong> If you apply for and receive a Monolith TokenCard, our relavent card issuer, Contis Financial Services Limited or UAB “Finansinės paslaugos „Contis“ (known as "Contis"), will also collect your personal information. We might pass certain information to Contis to allow you to apply for a Monolith TokenCard, and Contis might also collect certain personal information directly from you. Please read <a href="https://monolith.xyz/legals/programme-managers/contis/privacy-policy/policy">Contis's privacy policy</a> to understand how Contis collects, uses and shares your personal information.</p>
<h2 id="2-important-warning-about-using-the-ethereum-network">2. IMPORTANT WARNING ABOUT USING THE ETHEREUM NETWORK</h2>
<p class="sc-dVhcbM dEMqHK"><strong>2.1</strong> Please note that setting up a contract wallet, adding whitelisted addresses and making cryptoasset transactions through the Monolith Wallet will all involve the submission of your personal information (such as your whitelisted addresses, your public key and the transactions you make) to the Ethereum Network.
It is an inherent part of blockchain technology that information uploaded to the Ethereum Network cannot be erased. You may be able to disassociate yourself from this information by deleting your private key. However, this will not prevent people who know your public key from recognising you and the transactions you have made.</p>
<h2 id="3-who-is-responsible-for-the-use-of-your-personal-information">3. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p class="sc-dVhcbM dEMqHK"><strong>3.1</strong> Monolith and Contis are each separate data controllers of the personal information we or Contis hold about you in connection with your use of the Monolith Wallet, Monolith Services and Monolith TokenCard respectively.</p>
<p class="sc-dVhcbM dEMqHK"><strong>3.2</strong> This means that each of Monolith and Contis will determine and be responsible for how your personal information is used.</p>
