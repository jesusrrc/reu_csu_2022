Cookies are small files that our website may send to your browser and it is kept on your computer to make our website function properly, to provide business and marketing information to us and to facilitate your next visit to our site. The cookie data may improve form interactions based on information you have previously given to us. For example, in some cases, we will allow you to bypass a web form if a form cookie exists, or we may prefill a form with previously supplied contact information. In general, you can visit the Relimetrics website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself, such as your name, phone number, postal code or email address.<br/><br/>Our web server collects IP addresses to obtain certain aggregate information concerning the use of our website. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever youâre surfing the web. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information. Therefore you can remain anonymous when you visit our website. Occasionally you may be asked to give us more specific information about yourself, such as when you download software, register for a seminar or other event, respond to a survey, enter a contest from our website, and register at the customer portal. Supplying such information to us is optional, but you may be unable to complete certain transactions without giving such information.<br/><br/><strong>Types and kinds of cookies<br/>â</strong><br/>There are four types of cookies:<br/><br/><strong>- Strictly necessary </strong>â Technically essential to the provision of our website.

For example, recording visits to reveal how a website is used and which parts are most popular.<br/><strong>- Functionality</strong> â Enable additional functionality to improve user experience. For example, recording settings for future visits so as to save users having to repeat making the same choices.<br/><strong>- Advertising/targeting</strong> â Use an identification number to monitor personal preferences for the purposes of personalizing pages and gathering further information. For example, presenting adverts or promotions for products similar to those previously viewed or purchased.<br/><br/><br/>There are two main kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.

For example, presenting adverts or promotions for products similar to those previously viewed or purchased.<br/><br/><br/>There are two main kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.
