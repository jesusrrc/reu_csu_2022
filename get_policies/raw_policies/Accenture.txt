<p>We will process your personal information for the purposes mentioned above based on your prior consent, to the extent such consent is mandatory under applicable laws. </p>
<p>To the extent you are asked to click on/check “I accept”, “I agree” or similar buttons/checkboxes/functionalities in relation to a privacy statement, doing so will be considered as providing your consent to process your personal information, only where such consent is required by mandatory law. </p>
<span id="protect-your-personal-data-3"></span>

<p><strong>Will we share your personal data with third parties?</strong></p>
<p>We may transfer personal data to our service providers and  professional advisors, public and governmental authorities, Accenture companies/affiliates or third parties in connection with Accenture’s operation of its business, including any (potential) corporate or commercial transaction. Such third parties may be located in other countries. Before we do so, we shall take the necessary steps to ensure that your personal data will be given adequate protection as required by relevant data privacy laws and Accenture’s internal policies.  Accenture may also transfer your personal data to any of its global affiliates/partners in furtherance of any visits to our Accenture locations.</p>
<p>For example, we may disclose personal information to third parties for other business purposes as follows:</p>

</ul>
<p>We may also share your information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of a website, a merger, consolidation, asset sale, initial public offering, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy.</p>

In the limited cases where we do seek to collect such data, we will do this in accordance with data privacy law requirements and/or ask for your consent.</p>
<p>The term "sensitive data" refers to the various categories of personal data identified by data privacy laws as requiring special treatment, including in some circumstances the need to obtain explicit consent from you.

This certification is the only auditable international standard that defines the requirements for an Information Security Management System (“ISMS”) and confirms that Accenture’s processes and security controls provide an effective framework for protecting our clients’ and our own information.  </li>
<li>We have a global Client Data Protection (“CDP”) program in place which governs the stewardship of client information and systems entrusted to us.</li>
<span id="protect-your-personal-data-6"></span>

<p>Our BCR reflect the standards contained in European data privacy laws (including the General Data Protection Regulation).

If you wish to obtain further information on this balancing test approach, please contact <a data-isinternal="false" data-original-title="Mail to Data Privacy Officer.

    </p>
<p>We will process your personal data for the purposes mentioned above based on your prior consent, to the extent such consent is mandatory under applicable laws.</p>
<p>To the extent you are asked to click on/check "I accept", "I agree" or similar buttons/checkboxes/functionalities in relation to a privacy statement, doing so will be considered as providing your consent to process your personal data, only in the countries where such consent is required by mandatory law. In all other countries, such action will be considered as a mere acknowledgement and the legal basis of the processing of your personal data will not be your consent but any other applicable legal basis.</p>
<span id="protect-your-personal-data-3-california"></span>
<p>We will not use your personal data for purposes that are incompatible with the purposes of which you have been informed, unless it is required or authorized by law, or it is in your own vital interest (e.g. in case of a medical emergency) to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Will we share your personal information with third parties and service providers?</strong></p>
<p>We may transfer personal information to our service providers and professional advisors, public and governmental authorities, Accenture companies/affiliates or third parties in connection with Accenture’s operation of its business, including any (potential) corporate or commercial transaction. Such third parties may be located in other countries. Before we do so, we shall take the necessary steps to ensure that your personal information will be given adequate protection as required by relevant data privacy laws and Accenture’s internal policies.  Accenture may transfer your personal information to any of its global affiliates/partners in furtherance of any visits to our Accenture locations. </p>
<p>For example, we may disclose personal information to third parties for other business purposes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We share your information with third-party service providers that provide services to us, including billing, payment processing, customer service, email deployment, advertising and marketing, security and performance monitoring, maintaining or servicing accounts, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying customer information, research, data hosting, auditing, and data processing; </li>
<li>To protect and defend the legal rights, safety, and security of Accenture, our affiliates, users, or the public, including to protect against fraud and malicious activity; and </li>
<li>For other business purposes described in this privacy statement or for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect the information or pursuant to your consent. </li>
</ul>
<p>We may also share your information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of a website, a merger, consolidation, asset sale, initial public offering, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Unless you are otherwise notified, any transfers of your personal information from within the European Economic Area (EEA) to third parties outside the EEA will be based on an adequacy decision or are governed by the standard contractual clauses (a copy of which can be obtained through the contact information included below). <span id="protect-your-personal-data-4-california"></span>Any other non-EEA related transfers of your personal information will take place in accordance with the appropriate international data transfer mechanisms and standards.</p>
<p><strong>What about sensitive data?</strong></p>
<p>We do not generally seek to collect sensitive data as defined in the second paragraph below (also known as special categories within the EEA) through this site or otherwise. In the limited cases where we do seek to collect such data, we will do this in accordance with data privacy law requirements and/or ask for your consent.</p>
<p>The term "sensitive data" refers to the various categories of personal information identified by data privacy laws as requiring special treatment, including in some circumstances the need to obtain explicit consent from you. These categories include racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, philosophical or other similar beliefs, <span id="protect-your-personal-data-5-california"></span>membership of a trade union, physical or mental health information, biometric or genetic data, sexual life or orientation, finances, geolocation, the contents of private communications, sensitive data related to a consumer’s government I.D. (i.e. social security number or driver’s license number), or criminal convictions and offences (including information about suspected criminal activities).</p>
<p><strong>What about data security?</strong></p>
<p>We maintain organizational, physical and technical security arrangements for all the personal information we hold. We have protocols, controls and relevant policies, procedures and guidance to maintain these arrangements taking into account the risks associated with the categories of personal information and the processing we undertake.</p>
<p>We adopt market leading security measures to protect your personal information. This includes (without being limitative):</p>
<ul>
<li>We hold an ISO27001 certification, which indicates that we adhere to strict information security standards. This is a security standard awarded by the British Standards Institution (“BSI”) that serves as international certification that Accenture adheres to the highest and strictest standards. This certification is the only auditable international standard that defines the requirements for an Information Security Management System (“ISMS”), and confirms that Accenture’s processes and security controls provide an effective framework for protecting our clients’ and our own information.
        </li>
<li>We have a global Client Data Protection (“CDP”) program in place which governs the stewardship of client information and systems entrusted to us.</li>
<span id="protect-your-personal-data-6-california"></span>
<li>We have regular penetration testing performed by a third party provider, which continues to show the strength of our technical defenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where will your personal data be processed?</strong></p>
<p>As a global organization with offices and operations throughout the world, personal data we collect may be transferred or be accessible internationally throughout Accenture's global business and between its entities and affiliates.</p>
<p>Any such transfers throughout Accenture’s global business take place in accordance with the applicable data privacy laws and in accordance with our Binding Corporate Rules (“BCR”).</p>
<p>Our BCR reflect the standards contained in European data privacy laws (including the General Data Protection Regulation). Having our BCR means that all our group entities which have signed up to our BCR have to comply with the same internal rules. It also means that your rights (see “Which rights do you have with respect to the processing of your personal information?”) stay the same no matter where your data are processed by Accenture.</p>

<p>California law provides California residents with the right to receive a privacy notice with information about what we have collected, disclosed for business purposes, and sold during the preceding 12 months. This Accenture Privacy Statement for California Residents provides information about the categories of information that we have collected, the sources of that information, the purposes for which we have used the information, and the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed the information for business purposes.  </p>
<p>California law also affords California residents a right to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information. This right is applicable to the extent that Accenture is engaging in a “sale” of your personal information as that term is defined under applicable law. While Accenture generally is not in the business of selling information, there are limited circumstances where we share personal information with our clients, third-party partners, or others that we treat as a sale for which California residents have the right to opt out. We do not sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.</p>
<p>If you choose to exercise your rights, we will not charge you different prices or provide different quality of services unless those differences are related to your personal information or otherwise permitted by law.

Where necessary, this may include asking you for a copy of your valid government-issued identification, such as your valid passport or driver’s license (with the allowance of the redaction of your driver’s license number or social security number). If you would like to use an authorized agent registered with the California Secretary of State to exercise your rights, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf that we can confirm directly with the requestor. We reserve the right to deny requests from authorized agents in certain circumstances, such as where we have a reasonable belief that the request is fraudulent.
