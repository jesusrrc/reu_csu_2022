<p style="text-align:center; font-weight: bold;">Ivar Jacobson
International SA <br/>
<br/>
Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Ivar Jacobson International SA (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>” or
“<strong>Ivar Jacobson</strong>”) is committed to protecting and respecting your
privacy. This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data
we collect from you, or that you provide to us, when you visit our
website, use our products or services, or otherwise interact with us
and that will be processed by us. It is important that you read this
privacy policy together with any other privacy notice or fair
processing notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are
collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are
fully aware of how and why we are using your data. This privacy
policy supplements the other policies and notices and is not
intended to override them. For the purposes of the Data Protection
Act 1998 and, when it comes into force, the General Data Protection
Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”) and all successor legislation to
the Data Protection Act 1998 and the GDPR (the “Data Protection
Legislation”), the data controller is Ivar Jacobson International SA.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">1. Information we collect from you</p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px;"> Personal data, or personal
information, means any information about an individual from which
that person can be identified. It does not include data where the
identity has been removed (known as “anonymous data”). <br/>
<br/>
We may collect, use, store and transfer the following data about
you: <br/>
<br/>
<div style="margin-left: 50px;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">•
Information you give us.</span> This is information about you
that you give us when you register to receive our newsletters,
participate in our events, online webinars, purchase items from
our site, request trials or full versions of our products, use
our services or when you report a problem with our site, and
when you give us feedback or complete our ‘contact us’ form. The
information you give us may include your name, email address,
postal address, phone numbers, social media account names,
comments you submit or credit card information. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">• Information we collect about
you.</span> With regard to each of your visits to our site we
may automatically collect the following information:
<div style="margin-left: 60px;"> <br/>
• technical information, including the Internet protocol (IP)
address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your
login information, browser type and version, time zone
setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system
and platform; <br/>
<br/>
• information about your visit, including the full Uniform
Resource Locators (URL), clickstream to, through and from our
site (including date and time), products you viewed or
searched for, page response times, download errors, length of
visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as
scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), methods used to browse
away from the page, and any phone number used to call our
customer service number. </div>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">• Information we receive from
other sources.</span> We may receive personal information from
select third parties in order to fulfill orders for products, to
facilitate your receipt of one of our newsletters, or to
communicate with us concerning your participation in an event or
online webinar. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">• Currency Conversion:</span>
We process your IP address, in order to determine your location
for the purpose of currency conversion. We do this in order for
the selected currency to remain selected and consistent when
browsing our website and purchasing services and products so
that the prices can convert to your (the visitor) local
currency. </div>
<br/>
We may also collect, use and share aggregated data such as
statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated data
may be derived from your personal data but is not considered
personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly
reveal your identity. However, if we combine or connect aggregated
data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly
identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which
will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.<br/>
<br/>
We do not collect any special categories of personal data about
you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious
or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political
opinions, trade union membership, information about your health
and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information
about criminal convictions and offences.<br/>
<br/>
Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms
of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data
when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have
or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you
with services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or
service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the
case at the time. </div>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">2. Uses made of your information</p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px;"> We will only use your personal data
when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your
personal information:<br/>
<br/>
• to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered
into between you and us or to take steps at your request before
entering into any contracts; <br/>
<br/>
• to process responses to employment opportunities posted on job
posting websites or our website;<br/>
<br/>
• to comply with any legal obligations to which we are subject; or<br/>
<br/>
• where it is necessary for our or a third party’s legitimate
interests, including for the purposes of preventing fraud, except
where such interests are overridden by your interests or
fundamental rights and freedoms.<br/>
Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for
processing your personal information other than in relation to
sending third party direct marketing communications to you via
email.<br/>
</div>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">3. Purposes for which we will use your
personal data</p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px;"> We have set out below, in a table
format, a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal
data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have
also identified what our legitimate interests are where
appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
Note that we may process your personal data for more than one
lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are
using your data. Please contact us if you need details about the
specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal
data where more than one ground has been set out in the table
below.<br/>

<b>Marketing</b><br/>
<br/>
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal
data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.<br/>
<br/>
We may use your identity, contact details, usage data, technical
data and marketing preferences to form a view on what we think you
may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how
we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for
you.<br/>
<br/>
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have
requested information from us or purchased services from us or if
you provided us with your details when you entered a competition
or registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not
opted out of receiving that marketing.<br/>
<br/>
We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your
personal data with any company outside the Ivar Jacobson group for
marketing purposes.<br/>
<br/>
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing
messages at any time by contacting us at any time.<br/>
<br/>
Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will
not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a
product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service
experience or other transactions.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Change of purpose</b><br/>
<br/>
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we
collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it
for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original
purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the
processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original
purpose, please contact us.<br/>
<br/>
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we
will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows
us to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that we may process your personal data without your
knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where
this is required or permitted by law.<br/>
<br/>
</div>
<p><b>4. Disclosure of your information</b><br/></p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px;">
We may have to share your personal information with the third
parties set out below, or any other third parties notified to you,
for the purposes set out in paragraph 3 above:<br/>
<br/>
• Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and
insurers based in the UK.<br/>
<br/>
• Regulators and other authorities who require reporting of
processing activities in certain circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
• Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or mere
parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to
acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens
to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in
the same way as set out in this privacy policy.<br/>
<br/>
• Fraud prevention agencies.<br/>
<br/>
We require all third parties to respect the security of your
personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do
not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal
data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your
personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our
instructions.<br/>
<br/>
</div>
<p><b>5. International transfers</b></p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px;">
Some of our external third parties are based outside the European
Economic Area (“EEA”) so their processing of your personal data
will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure
a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at
least one of the following safeguards is implemented:<br/>
<br/>
• We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have
been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for
personal data by the European Commission.<br/>
<br/>
• Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal
data the same protection it has in Europe.<br/>
<br/>
• Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to
them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to
provide similar protection to personal data shared between the
Europe and the US. Please contact us if you want further
information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring
your personal data out of the EEA.<br/>
<br/>
</div>
<p><b>6. Data security</b><br/></p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px;">
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit
access to your personal data to those employees, agents,
contractors and other third parties who have a business need to
know. They will only process your personal data on our
instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.<br/>
<br/>
We use a secure server to protect the safety and security of
transactions over the Internet involving personal information.
However, the transmission of information via the internet is never
completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your
personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data
transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.<br/>
<br/>
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected
personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable
regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.<br/>
<br/>
</div>
<p><b>7. Retention</b><br/></p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px;">
We will only retain your personal information for as long as is
necessary to carry out the purpose for which it was collected,
including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or
reporting requirements.<br/>
<br/>
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data,
we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal
data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or
disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we
process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
purposes through other means, and the applicable legal
requirements.<br/>
<br/>
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that
it can no longer be associated with you) for research or
statistical purposes in which case we may use this information
indefinitely without further notice to you.<br/>
<b><br/>
</b></div>
<p><b> </b><b>8. Your rights</b><br/></p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px;">
Under the Data Protection Legislation, you may be entitled to the
following rights:<br/>
<br/>
• Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your
personal data for any purpose, you have the right to withdraw such
consent at any time by contacting our Data Privacy Team at 45
Beech Street, London, EC2Y 8AD or by email to
<a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f69f989099b69f8097849c97959994859998d895999bd8" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a><br/>
<br/>
• You can ask us to rectify any inaccuracies in the personal
information that we hold about you.<br/>
<br/>
• To request the erasure of personal information that we hold
about you where there is no good reason for us to continue
processing it, where you have successfully exercised your right to
object to processing, where we may have processed your information
unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to
comply with local law.<br/>
<br/>
• To object to our processing of your personal data where we are
relying on a legitimate interest (or that of a third party) and
there is something about your particular situation which makes you
want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts
on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right
to object where we are processing your personal data for direct
marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which
override your rights and freedoms.<br/>
<br/>
• To restrict our processing of your personal data (a) if you want
us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data
is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need
us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it
to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have
objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we
have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.<br/>
<br/>
• To request a copy of your personal data from us in a commonly
used and machine-readable format or that we transmit your personal
data to another data controller. • Not to be subject to automated
decision-making, including profiling, which has legal or other
significant effects on you.<br/>
<br/>
• To access information held about you. You will not have to pay a
fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other
rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request
is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we
may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
You can exercise any of the above rights at any time by contacting
us at 45 Beech Street, London, EC2Y 8AD or by email to
<a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="83eaede5ecc3eaf5e2f1e9e2e0ece1f0ecedade0eceead" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a><br/>
