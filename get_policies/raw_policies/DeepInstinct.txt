<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>2.3.1. General:</strong></p>
<p>In order to provide services to its Users, the Company collects certain types of data from its Users/Visitors. This section will describe how these two types of data are collected and used by the Company, as well as geographical differences that effect this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>2.3.2 Collection of User data</strong></p>
<p>During a User’s registration and later on the Company’s Website, it provides information such as name, email, address, telephone and other relevant data. This information used by the Company to identify the User and provide them with support, services, mailings, sales and marketing actions, billing and/or to meet contractual obligations.</p>
<p>The Company’s Users can at any time access and edit, update or delete their contact details by contacting the Company via email (as set herein below)</p>
<p><strong>2.3.3 Collection and Processing of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>The Company relies on the consent of the individual to process Personal Data (for example, when the User inputs personal information into the Website). On other occasions, the Company may process Personal Data when it needs to do this to fulfill a contract or where it is required to do so by law.</p>
<p>The Company may also process Personal Data when it is in its or its Partners’ legitimate interests to do so and when these interests are not overridden by the individual’s data protection rights (which may vary based on an individual’s jurisdiction).</p>
<p><strong>2.3.4. Geographical location</strong></p>
<p>The Company offers a number of data regions. A “Data Region” is a set of data centers located within a defined geographical area where Visitor and/or User data is stored. Personal Data is not transmitted between Data Regions. For Visitor and/or User with accounts located in European Data Region, all Personal Data is processed in the EEA.</p>
<p><strong>2.3.5. Processing in the European Economic Area (EEA)</strong></p>
<p>For Visitor and/or User with accounts located in European Data Region, all processing of Personal Data is performed in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“GDPR”) and the Company’s processing will take place in accordance with the GDPR.</p>
<p><strong>2.3.6. Controller/Processor</strong></p>
<p>The Company processes Personal Data both as a Processor and as a Controller, as defined in the GDPR:</p>
<p>The Company, which you as a Partner entered an agreement with, will be the Processor for User data provided by the Company to Partner and the Partner will be the Controller in accordance with Directive and GDPR.</p>
<p>For User data, provided by the User to Company through the Website, the Company will be the Controller in accordance with the GDPR. The Company adheres to the GDPR.</p>
<p>All data collected by the Company will be stored exclusively in secure hosting facilities provided by HubSpot, Inc. and/or Salesforce.com, Inc. All hosting is performed in accordance with the highest security regulations. The Company contract with its hosting provider ensures that all hosting performed in accordance with the highest security regulations.</p>
<p>The Company has adopted reasonable physical, technical and organizational safeguards against accidental, unauthorized or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, access, use or processing of the User’s data and/or the Personal Data in its possession. The Company will promptly notify you in the event of any known unauthorized access to, or use of, the User’s data and/or the Personal Data. Please note however that where you are transmitting information over the internet, this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
<p></p><h4>3. <u>Retention and deletion</u></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The Company will not retain Personal Data longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws or regulations. For User data, Users with an active account will therefore have the responsibility to delete data when required. When a user’s account terminated, all Personal Data collected through the platform will be deleted, as required by applicable law, and subject to user’s request as provided to the Company via email (as set herein below).</p><h4>4. <u>Acceptance of these Conditions</u></h4>

We encourage Visitors and/or Users and/or Partners to frequently check this page for any changes. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically and become aware of modifications. Continued use of the Website and/or the services after any changes to these conditions implies acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p><h4>5. <u>Our Legal Obligation to Disclose Personal Data</u></h4>
<p></p>
<p>We will reveal a Visitor and/or User’s Personal Data without his/her prior permission only when we have reason to believe that the disclosure of this information is required to establish the identity of, to contact or to initiate legal proceedings against a person or persons who are suspected of infringing rights or property of the Company or to others who could be harmed by the user’s activities or of persons who could (deliberately or otherwise) transgress upon these rights and property. We are permitted to disclose Personal Data when we have good reason to believe that this is legally required.</p><h4><u>6. Children’s Information</u></h4>
