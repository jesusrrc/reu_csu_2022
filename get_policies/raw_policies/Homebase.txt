</p>
<p>Google Analytics Cookies:</p>
<p>Name: _ga</p>
<p>Type: First Party Persistent</p>
<p>Duration: 2 years from set/update</p>
<p>
Purpose: This cookie is typically written to the browser upon the first visit. If the cookie has been deleted by
the browser operator, and the browser subsequently visits our site, a new _ga cookie is written with a different
unique ID. In most cases, this cookie is used to determine unique visitors to our site and it is updated with
each page view. Additionally, this cookie is provided with a unique ID that Google Analytics uses to ensure
both the validity and accessibility of the cookie as an extra security measure.
</p>
<p>Name: _gat</p>
<p>Type: First Party Persistent</p>
<p>Duration: 24 hours from set/update</p>
<p>
Purpose: This cookie is typically written to the browser upon the first visit. If the cookie has been deleted by
the browser operator, and the browser subsequently visits our site, a new _gat cookie is written with a different
unique ID. In most cases, this cookie is used to determine unique visitors to our site and it is updated with
each page view. Additionally, this cookie is provided with a unique ID that Google Analytics uses to ensure
both the validity and accessibility of the cookie as an extra security measure.
</p>
<p>Name: _utma</p>
<p>Type: First Party Persistent</p>
<p>Duration: 2 years from set/update</p>
<p>
Purpose: This cookie is typically written to the browser upon the first visit. If the cookie has been deleted
by the browser operator, and the browser subsequently visits our site, a new __utma cookie is written with a
different unique ID. In most cases, this cookie is used to determine unique visitors to our site and it is
updated with each page view. Additionally, this cookie is provided with a unique ID that Google Analytics
uses to ensure both the validity and accessibility of the cookie as an extra security measure.
</p>
<p>Name: _utmb</p>
<p>Type: First Party Persistent</p>
<p>Duration: 30 minutes from set/update</p>
<p>
Purpose: This cookie is used to establish and continue a user session with our site. When a user views a page on
our site, the Google Analytics code attempts to update this cookie. If it does not find the cookie, a new one
is written and a new session is established. Each time a user visits a different page on our site; this cookie
is updated to expire in 30 minutes, thus continuing a single session for as long as user activity continues
within 30-minute intervals. This cookie expires when a user pauses on a page on our site for longer than 30 minutes.
</p>
<p>Name: _utmc</p>
<p>Type: First Party Session</p>
<p>Duration: At the end of the session</p>
<p>Purpose: This cookie operates in conjunction with the '_utmb' cookie to determine whether or not to establish a new session for the user. If it does not find the cookie, a new one is written and a new session is established. This cookie expires when a user's session is no longer active.</p>
<p>Name: _utmz</p>
<p>Type: First Party Persistent</p>
<p>Duration: 6 months from set/update</p>
<p>
Purpose: This cookie stores the type of referral used by the visitor to reach our site, whether via a direct
method, a referring link, a website search, or a campaign such as an ad or an email link. It is used to calculate
search engine traffic, ad campaigns and page navigation within our site. The cookie is updated with each page
view to our site
</p>
<h3>Opting Out of Cookie Usage:</h3>
<p>
If you want to control which cookies you accept, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies or to
alert you every time a cookie is offered by a website's server. Most browsers automatically accept cookies.
You can set your browser option so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies
from your browser. You may find that some parts of the site will not function properly if you have refused
cookies. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for
information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We
recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features.
</p>
<h3>Aggregated Personal Data:</h3>
<p>
In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Pioneer Works often conducts
research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information
provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Pioneer Works may share
this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify
you personally. Pioneer Works may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to
current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
</p>
<h3>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h3>
<p>
Pioneer Works uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If
you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason
for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide
to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to
the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use

the Services. Pioneer Works and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell
you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you
will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition,
if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted
from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.
</p>

<h3>Children:</h3>
<p>
Pioneer Works does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under
the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal
guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing
their children never to provide Personal Data on the Services without their permission. If you have reason to
believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Pioneer Works through the Services, please
contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
</p>
<h3>California Privacy Rights:</h3>
<p>
We will not share any Personal Data with third-parties for their direct marketing purposes to the extent prohibited
by California law. If our practices change, we will do so in accordance with applicable laws and will notify you in advance.
</p>
<p>
California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not
Track signal. Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on,
send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does
not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals,
we do not currently respond to Do Not Track signal.
</p>
<h3>Additional Disclosures for California Residents:</h3>
<p>
These additional disclosures for California residents apply only to individuals who reside in California. The
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (<strong>“CCPA”</strong>) provides additional rights to know, delete and opt out, and
requires business collecting or disclosing Personal Data to provide notice of rights California residents have and
can exercise.
