<p>By using this Site, you acknowledge that you have reviewed the terms of our Privacy Statement and Consent to Use of Data (the “Privacy Statement and Consent”) and agree that we may collect, use and transfer your Personal Data and User Data in accordance therewith. The legal basis for this processing of your data is Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR for the Personal Data we process that forms the basis of a contract.  If you do not agree with these terms, you may choose not to use our Site, and please do not provide any Personal Data through this Site.  You can always revoke this consent at any time.

<p>Provided that we are basing the processing of your personal data on the need to balance interests, you can raise an objection to this processing of your data. This is the case if the processing is not required (in particular to) fulfil a contract with you. When exercising such a right of objection, we request that you outline the reasons why we should not process your personal data in the manner we have described. If you present to us your reasons, we shall check the circumstances and either stop and/or adjust the processing of the data, or present compelling counterarguments for continuing with the data processing.</p>
<p>You can of course object to the processing of your personal data for purposes of advertising and data analysis at any time. You can inform us of your objection to the use of your data for advertising through the contact details given at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<div class="sub">What Information Do We Collect?</div>
<p><strong>Information That You Give Us:</strong> We collect Personal Data such as your name, e-mail, or mailing address from you when you voluntarily choose to register for or use certain Monnit Services at this Site. We use the Personal Data that we collect in an effort to provide you with a superior customer experience on the Site and to improve and market Monnit Services. Monnit may store such Personal Data itself or it may be stored in databases owned and maintained by Monnit’s affiliates, agents or service providers. Monnit retains its rights to these databases and the information contained in them.</p>
<p>If you register with Monnit or use certain other of the personalized options we offer, we will create a profile that includes your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and other information that you provide that is pertinent to your specific situation. We may combine such information with data gathered from other sources. For instance, if incorrect postal codes are received, we may use third party software to correct them. We also may collect e-mail or other addresses from prospect lists of other companies, for example, in connection with a joint marketing effort. When we do so, (1) we acknowledge in our correspondence how the recipient was added to our list and (2) we provide a means for recipients to opt out of further communications from us. When you contact Monnit we may keep a record of that correspondence and may occasionally ask you to complete surveys for sales and research purposes.</p>
<p>In some instances, we contract with outside parties to collect and maintain our information collection servers and to perform technology and related services. We seek to provide any such third parties with only the information they need to perform their specific function and we require them to protect your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement and Consent. Wherever Monnit collects Personal Data we will provide a link to this Privacy Statement and Consent.</p>
<div class="sub">Personally Non-Identifiable Information:</div>
<div class="a">

Such User Data, which is collected passively using various technologies, is not used to specifically identify you. Monnit may store such User Data itself or it may be stored in databases owned and maintained by Monnit’s affiliates, agents or service providers. Monnit retains all rights to these databases and the information contained in them.</p>
</div>
<p>This Site will use such User Data together with data provided by other parties and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the keywords visitors used to find our Site and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers.

<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> In operating this Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your computer (actually to your browser) when you access a Web site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and allow us to analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that eliminates any need for you to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data through the use of such technology. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar.

</div>
<div class="sub">Transfer of Your Data Abroad</div>
<p class="thick">By voluntarily providing us with your Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Statement and Consent. Due to the nature of the Internet if you are visiting this Site from a country other than the United States, your communications will inevitably result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting this web site, you consent to these transfers. If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Monnit and the affiliates, agents and service providers referred to herein located in the United States and in other countries.</p>
<div class="sub">What are Your Choices?</div>
<p>You can use this Site without providing your Personal Data, although doing so may limit your ability to obtain certain information or to use other valuable Monnit Services, including, for example, informational newsletters and responses to specific inquiries you may have. Where no Personal Data is legally required or is necessary for a particular service (for example, to contact you in response to your request), the use of a pseudonym is accepted.</p>
<p>We keep your Personal Data only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal reporting or document retention requirements. We will take reasonable steps to update, correct or, upon your request, delete your Personal Data in our possession that you have previously submitted via this Site.

<p><strong>Access.</strong> Monnit permits a reasonable right of access and review of Personal Data held by Monnit by the individual to whom the Personal Data relates; however, to guard against fraudulent requests for access, Monnit will require information which it determines is sufficient to allow it to confirm the identity of the person making the request before granting access or making corrections. Monnit will endeavor to provide the information in question within a reasonable time and may charge an appropriate cost (e.g. photocopying, mail charges) to the individual making the request. Monnit reserves the right not to change any Personal Data but will append alternative text the individual concerned believes is appropriate.</p>
<p>In addition, in certain circumstances, Monnit may decline to provide access to Personal Data, including where Monnit determines that the information requested:</p>
<p>
        (a) May disclose:<br/>
        a. The Personal Data of another individual or of a deceased individual; or<br/>
        b. Trade secrets or other business confidential information;<br/>
        (b) Is subject to attorney-client or litigation privilege or a professional privilege or obligation;<br/>
        (c) Does not exist, is not held, or cannot be found by Monnit;<br/>
        (d) Could reasonably result in serious harm to the treatment or recovery of the individual concerned, serious emotional harm to the individual or another individual, or serious bodily harm to another individual; or<br/>
        (e) May harm or interfere with law enforcement activities or other investigative or regulatory functions of a body authorized by statute to perform such functions.<br/>
</p>
<p>Please note that although after receiving a request to update, correct or delete information, we will make reasonable efforts to effect such a change promptly, it is not always possible to complete the process before another communication is distributed. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Even if you have requested removal of your Personal Data from our lists, Monnit reserves the right to retain it in our files in some limited circumstances such as when such Personal Data may be necessary to honor your request to opt out of further communications, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems or as provided in our <span class="sub"><a href="/policy/terms/" title="terms and conditions">Terms and Conditions</a></span>. If Monnit is required to retain any portion of the Personal Data for such purposes, Monnit shall use reasonable efforts to limit such Personal Data to what is necessary to accomplish the particular purpose. Further, you acknowledge that due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems, Personal Data may continue to reside in our systems even after deletion. Therefore, you should not expect that your Personal Data will be completely removed from our systems in response to your request.</p>
<p>Monnit will not respond to repetitious or vexatious requests for access. In determining whether a request is repetitious or vexatious, it will consider such factors as the frequency with which information is updated, the purpose for which the information is used, and the nature of the information.</p>
<div class="sub">How Do We Use Your Personal Data and Other Information?</div>
<p>
        Monnit uses the Personal Data you provide for our business purposes in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement and Consent.
        <ul>
<li>If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, that Personal Data will be available to us for use in connection with the reason for which it was provided or for a consistent purpose, including, if applicable, processing an order placed by you or informing you that the product is no longer available. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we may use the Personal Data you provide to respond to you; or if you contact us about a job listing, the information you provide to us may be used to consider you for the position. We may also combine Personal Data that you have provided to us with information obtained by us from other parties.</li>
<li>Monnit and its affiliates also may use your Personal Data, User Data and other information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our customers and markets, to improve our products and services and to effect and facilitate sales.</li>
<li>Monnit and its affiliates may use this information to contact you, electronically, through telemarketing or otherwise, in the future to tell you about, and to offer for sale, products or services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt out" of receiving future communications.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, you may follow the "unsubscribe" procedure included with our communication. In addition, you may e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@monnit.com">privacy@monnit.com</a>. See How to Contact Monnit below.</p>
<div class="sub">Do We Share the Information that We Receive?</div>
<p>Monnit considers your information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. Monnit will share information including Personal Data with its subsidiaries and affiliates that have also agreed to be bound by this Privacy Statement and Consent. In addition, Monnit, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we retain another non-affiliated company to perform a function of this nature, we seek to provide them with only the information that they need to perform their specific functions, and we require them to protect your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement and Consent and Monnit 's restrictions.</p>
<p>In addition, if you input Personal Data on a co-branded registration page, relating, for example, to a contest co-sponsored by both Monnit and a partner company, then your Personal Data will be available both to Monnit and to such partner company. While Monnit will only use such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement and Consent, such partner company's use of your Personal Data will be subject to the privacy policy of that company and Monnit cannot be responsible for their use of your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of such partner company before providing information on any such co-sponsored page or promotion.<br/>There are also a limited number of circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data and other information in our possession with certain additional third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>
<p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Monnit may disclose your Personal Data, User Data and other information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Monnit or its affiliates, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers,</strong> Combinations and Related Activities: As we develop our business, we might sell, buy, restructure or reorganize businesses or assets. In the event of any sale, merger, reorganization, restructuring, dissolution or similar event involving our business or assets, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p>
<p>Monnit is the parent company of a large international group of companies. In light of this fact, we may, from time to time transfer your Personal Data to one of our databases in another country as provided above under the heading Transfer of Your Data Abroad.</p>
<div class="sub">Public and Unsolicited Information</div>
<p>This Privacy Statement and Consent shall not apply to Public Information you provide to Monnit through this Site or through any other means. If you include Personal Data in such Public Information, we will use such Personal Data only as provided herein, but we caution you that, because such information (including your Personal Data) was made available in a forum accessible by the public, the use and disclosure of information by others accessing the Site is not monitored or controlled in any way by Monnit nor are their activities governed by this Privacy Statement and Consent.</p>
<p>In addition, if you submit unsolicited Personal Data we will use it as provided herein, however, the other information included in such unsolicited submission is not covered by this Privacy Statement and Consent. Please refer to our discussion of “Public and Unsolicited Information” contained in our Site <span class="sub"><a href="/policy/terms/" title="terms and conditions">Terms and Conditions</a></span>.</p>
