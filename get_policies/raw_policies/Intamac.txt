This Privacy Policy describes how we collect such information, how we use it and to whom and under what circumstances we may disclose it.<br/>‍<br/></div><h3 class="heading_privacy_policy">How we collect information<br/></h3><div class="text_block_left_aligned"><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong><br/>‍<br/>We (or our service providers) may collect information from you when you:<br/>- Purchase products from us,<br/>- Create an account with us, or otherwise sign up for a service or feature;<br/>- Participate in a survey, poll, sweepstakes, contest or other promotion;<br/>- Communicate with us via third-party social media sites;<br/>- Submit a rating or review;<br/>- Or contact us, or otherwise communicate with us or provide information to us.<br/><br/>The “personal information” we collect may include, for example, your name, postal address, postal code, email address, telephone number, date of birth, payment information, details on items purchased, and other information you choose to provide to us. In some cases, you may provide information to us about someone else, such as when you request that we deliver an e-commerce order to that person or when you share website content. In these type of cases, you agree that you have the authority to provide us with such information.<br/>‍<br/><strong>Automatically Collected Site Usage Data</strong><br/>‍<br/>To facilitate the operation of a website, certain information is collected automatically from or about you in connection with your visit to the website or the device you are using to access the website. Servers may automatically gather site usage information (for example your IP address, information about your web browser, your device, your location (subject to consent), shopping, browsing and other such activities).<br/>‍<br/></div><h3 class="heading_privacy_policy">Cookies and similar technologies<br/></h3><div class="text_block_left_aligned">Like many companies, we (and our service providers) use cookies and other similar technologies to collect, store and track information about your Site usage. This information helps us to provide, operate, improve and personalise our Sites.<br/><br/><strong>What are Cookies<br/>‍<br/></strong>Cookies are small files of letters and numbers. These files are stored on the hard drive of the device you are using, be it a PC, mobile phone, or tablet. These letters and numbers are used to allow a website to remember certain bits of information, so that the user experience can be improved next time you visit.By using our website you agree that we may store and access cookies on your device in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br/><br/><strong>How we use Cookies<br/>‍<br/></strong>When you visit our website it is likely we will create cookies which are stored on your device. For the duration of your 'session' on our website these cookies help us to deliver the correct information and ensure you only have to enter required information once, thereby improving your browsing experience.We also use web analytics to understand how many people have visited our website, what they have looked at and how they found us etc. This gives us a better understanding of how our website is working. All data accrued cannot be used to identify personal information and merely gives us a general idea of how our website performs.This overview of the type of cookies we use is based on categories outlined by the International Chamber of Commerce, in the ICC UK Cookie Guide. Some cookies may appear in multiple categories.<br/><br/><strong>Category 1: strictly necessary cookies<br/></strong>These cookies are necessary for the website to function. By disabling these cookies, some aspects of a website will either not work, or not work properly, such as secure logins, location services, and e-commerce functionality.<br/><br/><strong>Category 2: performance cookies<br/></strong>These cookies gather information to help improve the day to day performance of a website. By analysing data collected we can enhance popular pages, fix bugs and error messages etc. All data is based on totals and averages and is strictly anonymous. For example we use Google Analytics, which creates several first-party cookies. The data that Google collects is kept strictly private and confidential and won't be shared with anyone else. We don't feel that Google Analytics is a breach of privacy as we are merely aggregating the data survey. The information that is collected is used to understand website trends and performance.<br/>‍<br/><strong>Category 3: functionality cookies<br/></strong>These are cookies which provide a 'memory' for the website, this enables the website to remember any personal choices you make (for example, your username, language or geographic location). A website may provide local weather reports, traffic updates and other similar localised information. These cookies are also used to remember changes you may make to text sizes, fonts and other customisable elements of the website. The information these cookies collect may be made anonymous and can't track activity on other websites.<br/><br/><strong>Category 4: targeting cookies or advertising cookies<br/></strong>We nurture the use of social media websites and believe sharing is a key part of how people access new information. Social media networks are a popular way of doing this. To enable people to share information via popular social media, our website may have functionality allowing this type of activity.<br/><br/>The owners of social media websites may place cookies on users' devices and they will have their own cookie policies. We have no control over these companies' cookies policies.<br/><br/><strong>How we use Cookies<br/>‍<br/></strong>Most web browsers enable you to decline or block cookies (check the “Help” or “Settings” menus of your browser to learn more).
