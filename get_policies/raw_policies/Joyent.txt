The service providers that administer these analytics services use automated technologies, including cookies, to collect data (such as truncated IP addresses and location data, web browser, operating system, cookies and other device identifiers) to evaluate, for example, your use of our Services, such as what website pages you visit, and to diagnose technical issues. The information is used to improve how our Services function.
