In 2001, they became the world\\u2019s first dimmable aircraft windows. These windows are still in service, validating the superior durability of SPD-Smart aviation products over any other shading system. To this day, they remain the only dimmable window to receive certification under FAA Supplemental Type Certificate (STC). In 2008, they became the first dimmable windows to fly on a commercial airline \\u2013 and are now on all Qantas Airlines Airbus A380s.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"Why are SPD-Smart aircraft windows better than other types of window shades?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]SPD-Smart cabin windows have no moving parts, reducing maintenance costs and downtime. They block more than 99.9% of harmful UV light, protecting the interior from fading. They default to their darkest possible state when the aircraft is on the ground, maximizing heat rejection and keeping interiors cooler. Operators have total light-control in their cabin, which increases passenger comfort and satisfaction. SPD-Smart products are fabricated by laminating film between substrates, which act as noise barriers, keeping cabins quieter.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"How do SPD-Smart dimmable aircraft cabin windows work?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]SPD-Smart aircraft windows use SPD film enclosed between thin plastic layers. Within this film are microscopic particles. When no electrical voltage is present, the particles absorb light and block it from passing through the film. When an electrical voltage is applied, the particles align so that light can pass through. Adjusting the voltage to the film provides a range of transparencies (i.e. very dark to fully clear) where light transmission can be rapidly varied to any degree desired depending upon preference or pre-programmed requirements.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"Is there a more technical description of how SPD-Smart aircraft windows control light?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]The SPD film layer in SPD-Smart aircraft windows could be called a \\u201clight valve.\\u201d In the film, droplets of liquid suspension are distributed. Light-absorbing microscopic particles are dispersed within the liquid suspension. The SPD emulsion is enclosed between two plastic substrates coated with a transparent conductive material. The particles are randomly oriented due to Brownian motion and absorb 99% \\u2013 99.9% of visible light hitting window. When an electrical voltage is applied, the particles align due to a field effect and light passes through the window. This gives users a range of transparency where light transmission can be rapidly varied depending upon the amount of voltage applied.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"How dark, and how clear, do SPD-Smart dimmable aircraft windows get?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]SPD-Smart aircraft windows can achieve over 99.9% light blockage \\u2013 almost all incoming visible light is blocked. The same window can be optically transparent \\u2013 clearer than the average aircraft window. Adjustment of the voltage to an SPD-Smart aircraft window allows users to choose an infinite number of tinting levels between these points.\\\\n\\\\n[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"How fast do SPD-Smart aircraft windows switch from clear to dark and back?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]A complete switching cycle of the SPD-Smart aircraft window, from fully clear to fully dark, and then back to fully dark, occurs in just a few seconds. This is in stark contrast to another type of smart window (\\u201celectrochromic\\u201d or \\u201celectrochromatic\\u201d), where a switching cycle can take several minutes.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"Can SPD-Smart aircraft windows provide complete privacy?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]Yes.

And they block 99% of harmful UV light at all times, which helps protect interior furnishings and artwork.These features combine to offer superior control over incoming light, glare and heat.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"Why are SPD-Smart architectural windows better than other types of window shades?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]Conventional window shades are space-consuming, view-blocking, dust-collecting, prone to malfunction and do not adapt well to changing environmental conditions and user needs. SPD-Smart architectural windows, however, offer an unparalleled combination of form and function. As sleek as a standard window and just as easy to keep clean, these dynamic glazings provide shading and privacy, reduce glare, preserve views on-demand, block 99% of harmful UV light at all times, and can be controlled manually or automatically. Best of all, they are instantly responsive and infinitely tunable.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"How do SPD-Smart architectural windows work?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]SPD-Smart products are made with SPD film patented by Research Frontiers. Within this film are millions of randomly oriented microscopic particles. When no electrical voltage is present, the particles absorb light and block it from passing through the film. When an electrical voltage is applied, the particles align so that light can pass through. By regulating the voltage, users instantly regulate the amount of light, glare and heat coming through products such as windows.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"Is there a more technical description of how SPD-Smart architectural windows control light?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]The SPD film layer in SPD-Smart architectural products is called a \\u201clight valve.\\u201d Within the film are millions of microscopic particles. The particles are randomly oriented due to Brownian motion and absorb over 99% of visible light hitting the window. When an electrical voltage is applied, the particles align and light passes through the window. Adjusting the voltage adjusts the orientation of the particles, which regulates the tint of the glazing and the amount of light transmitted.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"Are SPD-Smart architectural products available in custom sizes, shapes and fabrications?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]Indeed they are. SPD-Smart architectural products are available in sizes up to 1 meter wide and wider if pieces of SPD film as laminated side by side (i.e. \\u201cseamed\\u201d) within the laminate. Virtually any shape is available including circles, trapezoids and curves. Various fabrications are offered too. Laminates are ideal for interior partitions, while high-efficiency double- and triple-glazed insulating glass units are the energy efficiency choice for exterior windows, skylights and doors. In addition, these products are offered in conventional shapes and custom ones too, including curves.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"How are SPD-Smart architectural products controlled?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]There are many ways to control SPD-Smart architectural products. Most control systems involve a simple switch (similar to a dimmer switch for a light) or an on\\\/off pushbutton. You can easily integrate these products with a home automation or building management system that uses occupancy sensors, photo sensors, and time-of-day controls.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"What types of fabrications are offered for SPD-Smart architectural products?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]SPD-Smart single-panel laminates are ideal for interior partitions and doors such as those used in conference rooms and media centers. These laminates also are used for retrofits of existing windows in situations where advanced light-control is desired. For exterior glazing products, SPD-Smart architectural products also are offered in double- and triple-glazed fabrications for thermal efficiency.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"What type of power is required to control SPD-Smart architectural products, and how much power do they consume?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]SPD-Smart architectural products are controlled using AC voltage. Alternatively, DC power can be used to with conventional inverter (CHECK) integrated just before the SPD glazing. The power consumption of SPD-Smart products is nominal, and typically is just 1.8 mAmps per square foot when fully powered.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"How do SPD-Smart architectural products help protect interiors and artwork from fading and degradation?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]Interior furnishings and artwork can be highly susceptible to damage from excessive light-exposure. This damage is irreversible. SPD-Smart architectural products offer extraordinary protection in a number of ways. First, they block 99% of harmful UV light at all times. Fading and degradation also is caused by visible light, and SPD-Smart windows can block up to 99.5% of visible light in an instant. In addition, solar heat also causes fading and degradation.

They are fast-switching and provide levels of shading and privacy. In addition to regulating the amount of visible light entering a boat or yacht, these products also block 99% of harmful UV light at all times and help minimize onboard heat build-up. This provides more comfortable boating and sailing experiences, and it also can improve operating efficiency. Compared to conventional window treatments, SPD-Smart marine glazings are sleek, aesthetically inspired, and require very little maintenance.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"Why are SPD-Smart marine windows better than other types of window shades?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]Conventional window shades are space-consuming, view-blocking, dust-collecting, prone to malfunction and do not adapt well to changing environmental conditions and user needs. SPD-Smart marine windows, portholes, partitions and other products offer an unparalleled combination of form and function. As sleek as a standard window and just as easy to clean, these dynamic glazings provide shading and privacy, reduce glare, preserve views on-demand, block 99% of harmful UV light at all times, and can be controlled manually or automatically. Best of all, they are instantly responsive to changing operating conditions and user preferences.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"How do SPD-Smart marine windows work?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]SPD-Smart products are made with SPD film patented by Research Frontiers. Within this film are millions of randomly oriented microscopic particles. When no electrical voltage is present, the particles absorb light and block it from passing through the film. When an electrical voltage is applied, the particles align so that light can pass through. By regulating the voltage, users instantly regulate the amount of light, glare and heat coming through products such as windows.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"Is there a more technical description of how SPD-Smart marine windows control light?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]The SPD film layer in SPD-Smart architectural products is called a \\u201clight valve.\\u201d Within the film are millions of microscopic particles. The particles are randomly oriented due to Brownian motion and absorb over 99% of visible light hitting the window. When an electrical voltage is applied, the particles align and light passes through the window. Adjusting the voltage adjusts the orientation of the particles, which regulates the tint of the glazing and the amount of light transmitted.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"How quickly can SPD-Smart marine products change their light-control properties?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]SPD-Smart products change their light-transmission properties in 1-3 seconds and they do this for glazings of any size. Thus, in just a few seconds, you can adjust the tint of your SPD-Smart window to any level you want.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"How many light-control levels are offered by SPD-Smart marine products?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]Infinite. Similar to how a dimmer switch regulates the brightness of a light, by simply adjusting the voltage to the SPD-Smart product, you quickly and precisely \\u201ctune\\u201d the tint to any level you want.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"How do SPD-Smart marine products help protect interiors and artwork from fading and degradation?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]Interior furnishings and artwork can be highly susceptible to damage from excessive light-exposure. This damage is irreversible. SPD-Smart marine products offer extraordinary protection in a number of ways. First, they block 99% of harmful UV light at all times. Fading and degradation also is caused by visible light, and SPD-Smart windows can block up to 99.5% of visible light in an instant. In addition, solar heat also causes fading and degradation. The variable tint property of SPD-Smart glazings allows for optimal protection of furnishings and artwork from visible light, and it also effectively manages the heat transferred through windows, offering even more protection.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"What type of power source do SPD-Smart marine products require, and how much power do they use?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]SPD-Smart marine products are powered using AC voltage. In DC-powered environments, a simple converter (CHECK) is typically installed just before the glazings. All SPD-Smart products require very little energy to operate and typically draw about 1.8 milli amps of power per square foot.[\\\/xa_slide][xa_slide title=\\\\\\\"Do SPD-Smart products block harmful light?\\\\\\\" openclose=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" icon=\\\\\\\"Select Icon---\\\\\\\"]Yes.
