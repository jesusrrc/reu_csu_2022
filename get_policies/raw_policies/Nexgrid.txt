<br/>
<strong>Information we collect and how we use it</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Personal Information</strong><br/>
								  You may choose to provide personal information (such as your name, 
								  address, telephone number and email address) on this web site. Here are 
								  some of the ways you may provide the information and the types of 
								  information you may submit. We also tell you how we may use the 
								  information.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Contact Us</strong><br/>
								  If you email us through the "Contact Us" link on this site, we ask you for 
								  information such as your name and email address so we can respond to your 
								  questions and comments. You may choose to provide additional information 
								  as well.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Investor Communications E-mail Alerts</strong><br/>
								  If you would like to receive company news alerts from the Nexgrid 
								  Investor Communications Staff, we ask for your name and email address so 
								  we can send you the news alerts.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Questionnaires and Surveys</strong><br/>
								  We occasionally may ask visitors to our web site to complete online 
								  surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. 
								  These surveys help us serve you better and improve the usefulness of our 
								  site. In conducting these surveys we may ask you for your name and email 
								  address. We do not keep any personal information about you in connection 
								  with your participation in a ge.com survey unless you specifically agree 
								  to provide that information.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong><br/>

								  We collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when you visit 
								  this web site. Aggregate and non-personal information does not relate to a 
								  single identifiable visitor. It tells us such things as how many users 
								  visited our site and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, 
								  we learn how to best tailor our web site to our visitors. We collect this 
								  information either through "cookie" technology or with "web beacons," as 
								  explained below.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br/>
								  Like many companies, we use browser cookies on this web site. Browser 
								  cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive 
								  when you visit certain web sites. We use browser cookies to tell us, for 
								  example, whether you've visited us before or if you're a new visitor and 
								  to help us identify site features in which you may have the greatest 
								  interest. Browser cookies may enhance your online experience by saving 
								  your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. The "help" 
								  portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop 
								  accepting new browser cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new 
								  browser cookie, and how to disable existing browser cookies. Remember 
								  though, without browser cookies, you may not be able to take full 
								  advantage of all our web site features. We also use flash cookies on our 
								  web site to enhance your online experience. Flash cookies are similar to 
								  browser cookies, except that they can store data more complex than simple 
								  text. Flash cookies, by themselves, cannot do anything to or with the data 
								  on your computer. In addition, flash cookies cannot access or remember 
								  your email address or other personal information unless you provide the 
								  information on this site. We use flash cookies to provide you with a 
								  better user experience. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Information We Share</strong><br/>
								  We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about our web 
								  site visitors, except as described here. We may share information provided 
								  by our visitors to ge.com with service providers we have retained to 
								  perform services on our behalf. These service providers are contractually 
								  restricted from using or disclosing the information except as necessary to 
								  perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In 
								  addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to 
								  do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or 
								  other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is 
								  necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in 
								  connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.<br/>
<br/>
								  We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the 
								  event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. 
								  Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to 
								  direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided 
								  through this web site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy 
								  Statement.<br/>
<br/>
								  I<strong>nformation We Transfer</strong><br/>
								  We may transfer the personal information we collect on this site to other 
								  countries where we do business, but we will do so only for the purposes 
								  described above. When we transfer your information to other countries, we 
								  will protect that information as described here unless otherwise required 
								  by applicable laws.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Links to Other Sites</strong><br/>

								  We provide links to other web sites for your convenience and information. 
								  These sites may have their own privacy statements in place, which we 
								  recommend you review if you visit any linked web sites. We are not 
								  responsible for the content of linked sites or any use of the sites.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Children's</strong> <strong>Privacy</strong><br/>
								  This web site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we 
								  do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age 
								  of thirteen on the site. If we become aware that we have inadvertently 
								  received personal information from a visitor under the age of thirteen on 
								  the site, we will delete the information from our records.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How We Protect Personal Information</strong><br/>

								  We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect 
								  against unauthorized disclosure, use, alteration or destruction of the 
								  personal information you provide on this web site. We use secure socket 
								  layer (SSL) technology to help keep the personal information you provide 
								  on this site secure.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Updates to Our Privacy Statement</strong><br/>
								  This Privacy Statement may be updated periodically and without prior 
								  notice to you to reflect changes in our online information practices. We 
								  will post a prominent notice on this web site to notify you of any 
								  significant changes to our Privacy Statement and indicate at the top of 
								  the statement when it was most recently updated.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How to Contact Us</strong><br/>
								  If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Statement, or if 
								  you would like us to update information we have about you or your 
								  preferences, please contact us by:<br/>
