<h2>Usage of Personal Information</h2>
<ol>
<li>
                    We may use your personal information:

                    <ul>
<li>to provide Services to you; </li>

                    group are committed to use and process your data in strict accordance with this Policy.</li>
<li>The personal data that we collect may be stored, processed and transferred between any countries and locations

</ol>
<h2>Legal basis for collecting personal data</h2>
<ul>
<li>
                    Collecting personal data based on consents. The collection of email addresses for sending newsletters and marketing information
                    will be done only by using subscribing button. You can unsubscribe form our emails any time you decide
                    to do that.
                </li>
<li>
                    Collecting personal data based on legitimate interest. We may use personal data (email you provide us through registration
                    process) if it is considered to be of legitimate interest, and if the privacy interests of the data subjects
                    do not override this interest. Collecting emails allows us to provide you Services in appropriate way
                    and to establish network security.
                </li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, to establish the legal basis for data collection, an assessment has been made during which a mutual
                interest between DataArt and the individual person has been identified. This legal basis is primarily related
                to our sales and marketing purposes. We will always inform individuals about their privacy rights and the
                purpose for collecting personal data.</p>
<h2>Disclosing Personal Information to Third Parties</h2>
<ol>
<li>We may disclose your personal information to any of our personnel, officers, insurers, professional advisers,
                    agents, suppliers or subcontractors insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this
                    Policy.
                </li>
<li>We may also disclose your Personal Information to third parties when we believe, in good faith and in our
                    sole discretion, that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to:

<li>Your Personal information will not be kept for longer than is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which

<li>Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6, we will retain documents (including electronic documents)
                    containing personal data:

<h2>About cookies and their usage</h2>
<ol>
<li> Our web site uses third party “cookies”. A cookie is a file containing a modest amount of data specific to
                    a particular client and website (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web
                    browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser
                    requests a page from the server. This allows the server to deliver a page tailored to a particular user,
                    or the page itself can contain some script which is aware of the data in the cookie and so is able to
                    carry information from one visit to the website (or related site) to the next.</li>
<li>Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information
                    that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
                </li>
<li>Cookies can be used by web servers to identify and track users as they navigate different pages on a website
                    and identify users returning to a website.</li>
<li>We may use Cookies for remarketing and similar activities.
                    <br/> We use targeting cookies to tailor marketing to you and your interests. They are also used to limit
                    the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising
                    campaign. They remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other
                    organizations such as advertisers. Although these cookies can track your visits to other websites, they
                    do not usually know who you are. Without these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will be less
                    relevant to you and your interests.
                    <br/> As part of re-marketing we also may permit certain third party companies to help us tailor advertising
                    that we think may be of interest to users and to collect and use other data about user activities on
                    our site (e.g., to allow them to tailor ads on third party services). These companies may deliver ads
                    that might also place cookies and otherwise track user behavior. For this purpose DataArt uses 3rd party
                    vendor re-marketing tracking cookies, including the Google Adwords tracking cookie. This means we will
                    continue to show ads to you across the internet, specifically on the Google Content Network (GCN). It
                    is important to note that we are not collecting any identifiable information through the use of Google’s
                    or any other 3rd party remarketing system.
                    <br/> The third-party vendors, including Google, whose services we use – will place cookies on web browsers
                    in order to serve ads based on past visits to our website. – Third party vendors, including Google, use
                    cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to your website. This allows us to make special offers
                    and continue to promote our company to those who have shown interest. You can find information on particular
                    cookies used on this site here.</li>
</ol>
