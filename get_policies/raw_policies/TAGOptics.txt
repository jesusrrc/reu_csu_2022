<li><p><span class="b">Information You Provide to Us</span></p>
<p><span class="b">Account Information</span> When you sign up for any of our Services (on your own or on behalf of your company), we may ask you to register for an account, and in the process collect certain personal information from you as part of your account registration. This information may include your name, e-mail address, mailing address, company name, credit card number, and credit card expiration date and security code (“Personal Information”).</p>
<ul>
<li>We retain information on your behalf, such as files and messages that you store using your account.</li>
<li>If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.</li>
<li>When you post messages on any message boards or blogs on our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it.</li>
<li>We also collect other types of personal information that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number, and other requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Services.</li>
<li>We may also collect Personal Information, such as at other points in our Site that state that information being collected.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="b">Questionnaires and Surveys.</span> From time to time, our Site may also be conducting questionnaires and surveys. We will use information you provide in response to survey questions to help us improve the appeal of our products and services.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="b">Information Collected via Technology</span></p>
<p><span class="b">Automated Information.</span> To make our Site more useful to you, we receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with a SEARCH OPTICS site. Like many other digital content providers, we use “cookies” and obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses a SEARCH OPTICS site, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your Internet-connected device, information about your browser software and operating system, the date and time you access our Site, and information about your “clicks” and pages you view within our digital content. “Cookies” are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide certain features on a SEARCH OPTICS site. The “Help” feature in most Web browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Keep in mind that disabling cookies may result in some features of a SEARCH OPTICS site not working properly.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="b">Third Parties with whom we Share Information Collected on Search Optics Sites</span></p>
<p>We do not sell any Personal Information to third parties about our customers or visitors to our digital content.</p>
<p><span class="b">Third-Party Service Providers.</span> We engage other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, including sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, and processing credit card payments. These service providers have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
</p><p><span class="b">Third-Party Ad Servers and Networks.</span> Third-party advertisement vendors may use cookies to serve ads on this Site or enable them to serve advertisements to visitors based on their visits to this website as well as to other sites on the Internet.</p>
<p>Cookies may also be used to track users’ activities on this website to measure advertisement effectiveness and other reasons that will be provided in their own privacy policies, SEARCH OPTICS may have limited or no access in control over these third-party cookies.</p>
<p>To opt out of third-party advertisement cookies on this Site, you may visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices. Tracking of users through third-party cookie mechanisms are subject to their respective vendors’ privacy policies.</p>
<p><span class="b">Business Transfers.</span> As we continue to develop and evolve our business, we may acquire, or be acquired by, other companies or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets, but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Statement (unless you consent to different treatment).</p>
<p><span class="b">With Your Consent.</span> We may also share your information with other third parties if you give us your affirmative consent to transfer your information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="b">Links to Third-Party Sites</span></p>
<p>An SEARCH OPTICS site may contain links to digital content owned and operated by third parties. We have no responsibility for linked third-party digital content, and provide these links solely for convenience. The privacy statements of these third-party sites may differ from our <span class="b">Privacy Statement.</span></p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="b">Information Collected when you Visit our Customer’s Digital Contents</span></p>
<p>When you visit digital content served by one of our customers (a “Customer Site”) who has implemented certain SEARCH OPTICS software, including SEARCH OPTICS performance marketing analytics and phone tracking tools, one or more tracking cookies may be placed on the digital device you use to access the content. In many cases, the system will also append this tracking ID to the URL for the content. The tracking cookies that our service places on the digital device typically do not include any information that is personally identifiable to you. However, should a Customer Site require the collection and storage of personally identifiable information, you will be clearly notified of this request and be presented with an option to opt out of the request.</p>
<p>Our service collects and analyzes information about conversions, click behavior, call tracking, call recording (when enabled by SEARCH OPTICS customers), link sharing, and other activity about visits to, and activity on, a Customer Site from your digital device, and shares this information with the customer who operates the Customer Site. We may disclose or distribute data about user behavior across all (or most) of the Customer Sites covered by our service to third parties.</p>
<p>In addition, for some of our Customer Sites, we place additional tracking cookies and “pixel tags” (also known as “Web beacons” or “tracking pixels”) on the digital device you are using. These pixel tags and tracking cookies do not include any Personal Information.</p>
<p>We rely on a third-party service provider to place these pixel tags and tracking cookies on your digital device. We provide them to other third-party service providers so that they can identify your digital device when you visit digital content that participates in our advertising network and serve advertisements to you that we believe will be relevant or interesting to you, based on the information we have tracked about your activity on Customer Sites. We may share these pixel tags and information we collect about activity from your computer with our third-party service providers in order to provide this advertising service to our customers.</p>
<p>Otherwise, except with our customer’s express written permission or as described in this Privacy Policy, information that our service collects about your behavior on a Customer Site is disclosed only with the customer and with no other third parties.</p>
<p>You should be aware, however, that Customer Sites are not owned or operated by us. Instead, they are operated by third parties who are our customers. <span class="b">We do not exercise any control over the privacy practices of our customers</span>. The privacy of your personally identifiable information on Customer Sites is governed by your relationship with the Customer Site, including any privacy statement that may be posted on the Customer Site. In addition, you should be aware that our customers could combine information we provide about your activity on the Web with personally identifiable information that they have separately obtained about you. We strongly recommend that, if you have any concerns about your privacy on a Customer Site or any digital content, you review and familiarize yourself with the privacy statement for that digital content and contact the digital content’s administrator directly with any questions.</p>
