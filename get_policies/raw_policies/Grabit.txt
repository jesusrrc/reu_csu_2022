<p style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">5. How Grabit
                      Shares Information It Collects From Users</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">5.1. Sharing between Customers and Couriers</span></p>
<p>Once a Courier accepts a delivery request from a Customer, the Customer can see the Courier‚Äôs first
                  name and last initial and the Courier can see whatever name the Customer provided when signing up. A
                  Customer is also able to see a Courier‚Äôs photo. During a delivery, the Customer in some instances is
                  able to see the Courier‚Äôs real-time location, and the Courier is able to see the Customer‚Äôs delivery
                  address. During a delivery, Customers and Couriers are able to call and text each other. Customer and
                  Courier phone numbers are masked and, only in rare instances, may they be able to see the other‚Äôs
                  phone number. As described above, Customers are able to see a Courier‚Äôs aggregate ratings during a
                  delivery. After a delivery, we may share feedback or comments that a Customer provides with a
                  Courier, but we will not identify the Customer. We may also share with Couriers their aggregate
                  ratings.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">5.2. Service Providers</span></p>
<p>We share your information with service providers that perform services on our behalf, including all
                  of the uses described in Section 4 above.</p>
