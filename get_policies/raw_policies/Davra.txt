that you have requested. The personal information we collect may include:

contact details, such as your name, title, company/organization name, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, and physical address;
information about your company, and job function;
your e-mail marketing preferences;
information such as your nationality and country of residence that allows us to determine your eligibility under export control regulations to receive information about certain technologies;
information used to customize and facilitate your use of our websites, including login and technical information;
inquiries about and orders for our products and services;
information that assists us in identifying the products and services that best meet your requirements;

feedback from you about our websites and our products and services generally.

You are not required to provide any of this information, but if you do not, we may not be able to provide you the requested service or complete your transaction.

Information collected automatically We collect information about your visit to our sites, including what pages you view, the number of bytes transferred, the links you click, the materials you access, and other actions taken within Davra Networks's sites. 
On sites that you enter with a user ID, we may connect this information with your identity to determine your potential interests in our products and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every
 website you visit, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and capabilities and language, your operating system, the date and time you access the site, and the website from which you linked to our site. 
 We do not link this information to your identity.

Our use of information
Services and transactions. We use your personal information to deliver services or carry out transactions you have requested, such as providing information on Davra Networks products, registering purchased products, processing product orders, 
answering customer service requests, facilitating use of our websites, and so forth. In order to offer you a more consistent experience in your interactions with Davra Networks, information collected by our websites may be combined with 
information we collect by other means.

Website improvement. We may use your personal information to improve our websites and related Davra Networks products or services, or to make our websites easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information 
or by customizing our websites to your particular preference or interests.

Communications. With your permission, we may use your personal information gathered via our websites to inform you of products or services available from Davra Networks. When collecting information that might be used to contact you about 
our products and services, we will always give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such communications. Moreover, each e-mail communication we send includes an unsubscribe link allowing you to stop delivery of that type of communication. 
If you elect to unsubscribe, we will remove you from the relevant list within 10 business days.

Employment Applications. In connection with a job application or inquiry, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume or curriculum vitae. We may use this information throughout Davra Networks and its controlled 
subsidiaries and affiliates for the purpose of employment consideration. We will keep the information for future consideration unless you direct us not to do so.

Our use of cookies and web beacons
Cookies are small files that websites save to your hard disk or to your browser's memory. We may use them to track the number of times you have visited the site, to track the number of visitors to the site, to determine and analyze visitors' 
use of our sites (including the effectiveness of online advertising), to store information that you provide such as your preferences, and to store technical information useful for your interactions with our websites. 
We may use session cookies (cookies that are deleted when your browser session ends) to store your user ID, elements of your user profile, to facilitate your movement around our websites (particularly in connection with information searches and 
order placement) and other information useful in administering the session. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies 
or to notify you when a cookie is being placed on your computer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of Davra Networks's websites or other websites that you visit. Our sites also may contain 
electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow us to count the number of users who have visited those pages. We may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or Newsletters in order to determine 
whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

Disclosure of your personal information
Except as described below, personal information you provide to Davra Networks through our websites will not be shared outside of Davra Networks and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission.

Disclosure to service providers. Davra Networks contracts with other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as hosting websites, sending out information, processing transactions, and analyzing our websites.
We provide these companies with only those elements of your personal information they need to deliver those services. These companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose.

Disclosure to distributors. In responding to a request made by you, we may share your personal information with companies that distribute our products. In those cases, we provide these companies with only those elements of your personal 
information they need to respond to your request, and these companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose. In some cases, we may seek your permission to share your information with 
distributors for marketing purposes other than responding to a request from you. However, we will not share your information for such marketing purposes unless we have obtained your express consent to do so.

Disclosure in connection with transactions. In connection with certain transactions, we may disclose some or all of your personal information to financial institutions, government entities, and shipping companies or postal services involved in fulfillment.

Disclosures in connection with acquisitions or divestitures. Circumstances may arise where for strategic or other business reasons Davra Networks decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. 
Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is Davra Networks's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

Disclosure for other reasons. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal requirements or with legal process served on us, to protect and defend our 
rights or property, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of any individual.

Security
Davra Networks is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. 
For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access that are located in facilities to which access is limited. For sites to which you login, it is your responsibility to ensure the security of 
your password and not to reveal this information to others. When you move around a site to which you have logged in, or from one site to another that uses the same login mechanism, we verify your identity by means of an encrypted 
cookie placed on your machine.

Reviewing your personal information
In some cases, you can review and correct personal information provided through our websites by going to the page on which you provided the information. In all cases, you can make a request to review and correct your personal 
information collected via our websites or ask Davra Networks to stop using it by completing our Contact Us form. We may take steps to verify your identity before providing you access to your personal information. 
You can help us to maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying us of any change to your mailing address, phone number, or e-mail address.

Consent to international transfers of personal information
The personal information we collect on our websites may be sent to the United States or to any other country in which Davra Networks or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. 
We may also store and process the information there. Although the laws that protect personal information in those countries may differ from the laws where you live, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. 
By using our websites and giving your information to us, you consent to the transfer of the data outside of your country.

Children's information
Davra Networks does not knowingly collect information from children and does not target or direct its websites to children.

Links to other sites
Our websites may contain links to other sites such as Davra Networks distributors and sales affiliates, professional and government organizations, and publications. We also link to third-party providers that host, maintain and operate
on-line training curricula. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.

Enforcement of this privacy statement
If you have questions regarding this statement or our handling of your personal information, please Contact Us. We will promptly address your concern and strive to reach a satisfactory resolution.

Changes to this privacy statement
Davra Networks may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top and bottom of the privacy statement. We will obtain your opt-in consent for any updates to this privacy statement 
that materially expand the sharing or use of your personal information in ways not disclosed in this privacy statement at the time of collection."
