<header><h2 id="id.1dw1dy112b4n">I. INFO WE COLLECT</h2></header>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong>We collect info in three main ways:</p>
<ul><li>You provide some of it directly (such as by registering for an account).</li>
<li>We record some of it automatically (including with technologies like cookies).</li>
<li>We receive some of it from third parties (like social media companies).</li></ul>
<p>The particular kinds of info we gather usually depend on how you interact with us, like which Riot Services you use and how you do so.</p>
<h3 id="id.pzo7lk5clor9">A. Info You Provide</h3>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong>We collect info you choose to provide or give to us in any manner. You don’t have to share info when we ask you for it, but if you decline, you might not be able to access certain Riot Services or take advantage of their full functionality.</p>

<div class="ui-accordion-content" style="display:none;">
<p>We collect info you enter or otherwise provide on the Riot Services, including:</p>
<ul><li>Your email address, date of birth, in-game name (e.g. Riot ID), and similar contact info (like when you <a href="https://signup.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/index" target="_blank">register for an account</a>);</li>
<li>Your username, password, and other details that help us secure and provide access to the Riot Services (like when you login to our games or websites);</li>
<li>Your name, billing address, telephone number, payment method, and other details we collect to help process purchases you make (like when you buy Riot Points or shop at our Merch Store);</li>
<li>Your support-related info, including the nature of your concern and your account or order details (like when you request help from us, such as by submitting a Player Support ticket);</li>
<li>Your preferences, interests, and general demographic info (such as your hobbies, favorite games, or other info you share, like when you respond to a survey);</li>
<li>Info you share with us in connection with contests or promotions (like to submit an entry, prove your eligibility, or claim a prize if you win);</li>
<li>Your Riot Games account info (like your preferred game settings, key bindings, friends list, and mastery and rune pages); and</li>
<li>Info you decide to give us (which may include info about your health and other “sensitive” info) so that we can better make the Riot Services accessible to you by accommodating specific needs you may have, such as being deaf, hard of hearing, blind or visually impaired.</li></ul>
<p>The Riot Services also offer social features like voice and text chat. When you use these features, the info you share may be seen or overheard by others. We may collect and use the info you provide, including to enforce our <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> (such as described in <a href="#id.lrsx17ek1hak">Anti-Cheat &amp; Fraud Prevention</a> and <a href="#id.gemr1mkzchl6">Communication &amp; Player Behavior</a> below), and in some cases it may also be collected or used by others without your knowledge (for example, if you’re chatting with another player while they stream a match).</p>
<p>When you play multiplayer games like League of Legends, note that some info will be publicly accessible to others, such as your game statistics and performance. We may record gameplay and related info (such as your in-game name, build order, and in-game actions), and replay or otherwise make it available to other players without further notice to you. For example, players can watch each other play League of Legends using Spectator Mode, and we may use gameplay footage to help promote or improve the Riot Services.</p>
<p>If you disclose any information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Riot Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this privacy notice.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Sometimes we obtain info from third parties to use along with the info we collect. For example, if you link your Facebook account with your Riot Games account, Facebook may share info with us in accordance with Facebook’s privacy notice and your privacy settings on it.

<p>We may collect info from third parties to supplement the info you provide and the info we collect automatically for our legitimate purposes. For example:</p>
<ul><li>We obtain info from third parties if you use their services in connection with the Riot Services (such as linking your Facebook account with the Riot Services via the Add Friends feature). Your privacy settings on the third party’s service control what info they can share with us—it can include info like your name, profile picture, gender, age range, username, language, country, your friends and other info you have made available on the platform. Please make sure you’re comfortable with what they might share by reviewing their posted policies, and if applicable, modifying your privacy settings directly on their service.</li>
<li>We gather advertising and analytics info from third parties to help support our marketing initiatives, improve the Riot Services, and better manage our ad campaigns (like by displaying more personalized ads and measuring how effective they are). To learn more about these companies, see <a href="#id.odby2md40cdi">Analytics &amp; Interest-Based Ads</a>.</li>
<li>We collect info from third parties to help us identify from where you’re using the Riot Services (like your approximate location based on your IP address). This helps us, for example, process purchases (like assessing tax obligations), prevent fraud or abuse of the Riot Services (such as identifying suspicious transactions or activity), and customize your visit (like displaying the Riot Services in your local language).</li>
<li>We’ll also receive info from third-party platforms (like the Apple App Store or Google Play) if you download the Riot Services (such as the League+ app) on your mobile device. This might include, for example, technical details (like device IDs) and the fact that you’ve downloaded one of our apps.</li>
<li>Facebook provides us with info about your use of our fan pages on Facebook. To learn more about this, see <a href="#id.ca9auzy9dlrh">Facebook Fan Pages</a>.</li></ul>

<h3 id="id.a0i644esjx0j">A. Cookies &amp; Related Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We use our own servers and technologies like cookies to automatically collect and store info about how you interact with the Riot Services, as well as the device you use to do so.</p>

<p>“Cookies” are small pieces of data that online services you use place on your device for record-keeping and identification purposes. “Web beacons” are transparent pixel images that allow online services to collect info about the ways you interact with them (like whether you’ve opened an email or clicked on an ad). Similar common technologies include things like tags, scripts, local shared objects, local storage (e.g., HTML5), and related tools.</p>
<p>The Riot Services use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to automatically collect, store, and read files on your device. They may be delivered in a first-party (i.e., by Riot Games) or third-party (i.e., by other companies) context. These tools help the Riot Services work and operate more efficiently, as well as capture info about how you interact with us (see <a href="#id.1dw1dy112b4n">Info We Collect</a>).</p>
<p>We also use our servers in connection with these technologies to collect info about the ways you interact with the Riot Services and store it in log files. This may include, for example, info that your device, browser, or operating system sends to us when you access the Riot Services (like device IDs, IP addresses, and hardware or software specifications) and details about how you use your Riot Games account (like the particular features you use, your in-game interactions and statistics, and other similar info).</p>
<p>We use info gathered through our servers and technologies like cookies for several reasons based on Riot Games’, third parties’ or players’ legitimate interest, including:</p>
<ul><li>To monitor, secure, and maintain the Riot Services (like preventing fraud);</li>
<li>To enhance your browsing experience (such as allowing you to log-in to your account);</li>
<li>To analyze and improve our operations (like aggregating traffic and usage patterns);</li>
<li>To control the display of ads (including providing you with targeted offers);</li>
<li>To support and gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns (like letting us know if you’ve clicked on our ads or opened our emails);</li>
<li>To better personalize your visit and store your preferences and settings (for example, displaying content in your local language); and</li>
<li>To otherwise manage our relationship with players and provide the Riot Services under the <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> (including to improve our services and ensure a more positive and fair gaming environment, such as described in <a href="#id.lrsx17ek1hak">Anti-Cheat &amp; Fraud Prevention</a> and <a href="#id.gemr1mkzchl6">Communication &amp; Player Behavior</a> below).</li></ul>
<p>You can learn more about cookies and similar technologies, including details of how to manage or disable them, by reading our <a href="http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/cookie-policy" target="_blank">Cookies Policy</a>, and by visiting <a href="http://aboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">AboutCookies.org</a> or consulting your browser’s privacy features. Some ways of managing traditional cookies may not impact the use of other technologies, but certain browsers may offer their own tools for removing HTML5. We do not currently respond to browser do-not-track signals.</p>
<p>Please note that disabling technologies like cookies may prevent you from using the full functionality of the Riot Services and the Riot Services may not work as we intended.</p>

<h3 id="id.odby2md40cdi">B. Analytics &amp; Interest-Based Ads</h3>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We partner with third parties (like content providers, analytics companies, and advertising networks) to help us improve the Riot Services and better understand how you interact with them, as well as support our marketing initiatives. These companies may collect info from you automatically in connection with your visit.</p>
<div class="ui-accordion">
<p class="accordion-header content-right" style="display:block;">
<a href="#info"><strong>Expand</strong></a>
</p>
<div class="ui-accordion-content" style="display:none;">
<p>In addition to the technologies we place, other companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you visit the Riot Services. This includes vendors we’ve engaged to provide services on our behalf (like website analytics), as well as third parties that deliver content (like videos from YouTube) or offers (like ads from ad networks) contained on the Riot Services. We may receive reports based on our partners’ use of these tools on an individual or aggregate basis.</p>
<p>For example, we use third-party analytics providers (like Google Analytics) to help evaluate and report on use of the Riot Services. We also partner with ad companies to support our marketing efforts, including by serving you ads better tailored to your likely interests (such as based on your browsing activity on the Riot Services and when visiting other online services). These companies may set and read their own cookies and similar technologies to gather info about your online activities across websites and services.</p>
<p>Some analytics providers and ad companies offer you choices about how they collect and use info directly on their websites. To learn more about opting out of Google Analytics, check out the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>. For a representative list of third-party advertising and analytics partners that operate on the Riot Services, as well as information about how to opt out to the extent applicable, see <a href="#id.a0i644esjx0j">Cookies &amp; Related Technologies</a>. You may also be able to opt out in some cases by visiting <a href="https://youradchoices.com/" target="_blank">YourAdChoices.com</a> or <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank">Optout.NetworkAdvertising.org</a>, or if you’re located in the EU or Canada, <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">YourOnlineChoices.eu</a> or <a href="http://www.youradchoices.ca/" target="_blank">YourAdChoices.ca</a> respectively. You can learn more about cookies and similar technologies, including details of how to manage or disable them, by reading our <a href="http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/cookie-policy" target="_blank">Cookies Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising won’t necessarily prevent info from being collected automatically on the Riot Services, and it doesn’t mean you’ll receive fewer ads or stop them from being displayed. Instead, the ads you do receive won’t be interest-based any longer and therefore might be less relevant to your interests.</p>

<p>If you share info publicly through interactive features we control, such as voice and text chat, you should understand that this info becomes viewable and/or accessible to others. We reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor and record your use of them, including for purposes like enforcing our <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> and applicable player behavior requirements (see <a href="#id.gemr1mkzchl6">Communication &amp; Player Behavior</a> and <a href="#id.lrsx17ek1hak">Anti-Cheat &amp; Fraud Prevention</a>.</p>
<p>We may disclose player info in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). This means your info may be one of the assets transferred to the acquiring entity in such situations, according to Riot Games’ legitimate interest in engaging in such transactions and operating and expanding our business. </p>
<p>Please note that your in-game name (e.g. Summoner Name or Riot ID) and gameplay statistics (like your match history, item builds, and average number of kills and deaths) are viewable to others and may be shared in-game and out-of-game with players and other third parties. This includes info we share with the League of Legends developer community via the <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/" target="_blank">Riot Games API</a> so they can help contribute to the player experience.</p>
<p>We may also use, disclose, and preserve info to:</p>
<ul><li>Comply with applicable law or respond to legal process (like requests from law enforcement or other public or government authorities), including based upon our legitimate interest in doing so;</li>
<li>Securely operate the Riot Services (like stopping attacks on our systems), based on Riot Games’, players’ and third parties’ legitimate interest in the Riot Services being a safe and secure environment;</li>
<li>Protect players and third parties (such as to help prevent serious injury, abuse, or crime), based on Riot Games’, players’ and third parties’ legitimate interest in the Riot Services being a safe and secure environment; and</li>
<li>Protect our own rights, property, and operations (like enforcing our contracts and terms—including the <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>—and pursuing available remedies or limiting the damages we may sustain), based on Riot Games’ legitimate interest in protecting and preserving such and enforcing its legal rights.</li></ul>

<h3 id="id.gemr1mkzchl6">D. Communication &amp; Player Behavior</h3>
<p>We’ve empowered our players to help enforce our policies (e.g.the acceptable use and behavioral policies that we publish from time to time on our websites, apps and games) related to certain in-game behavior. For example, players may report each other and submit information about their in-game activity and actions to help us determine if the reported behavior constituted a violation of rules and procedures that apply to player conduct, as well as any potential repercussions (such as temporary or permanent account suspensions or chat restrictions).</p>
<p>We also record and store, and reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor voice and text chat and similar details about optional interactions for a period we determine is appropriate to help us, among other things, address disruptive behavior, improve our services, enforce our rules and policies and <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>, and foster a more positive gaming community for our players. We engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, comply with a legal obligation (e.g. to keep the Riot Services safe and secure), and/or because we have a legitimate interest (e.g. understanding how the Riot Services are used, keeping them secure, and improving them).</p>
<p>We use both manual (like enabling you to report such behavior through Player Support tickets) and automated (such as machine learning, transcription, and analysis) tools and techniques to support these efforts.</p>
<p>To enable us to monitor compliance with our policies, we develop template patterns of inappropriate behavior (e.g. abuse, hate speech, cheating, threats, offensive or inappropriate names), which we consider indicative of prohibited behaviors. We do this based upon an analysis of actual behaviors on the Riot Services. We grade these patterns of inappropriate behavior based upon their severity with different consequences (e.g. temporary or permanent account restrictions or communications restrictions) for players based upon how serious their conduct is. If another player makes a complaint about your behavior, our automated tools use these patterns of inappropriate behavior and grading system to compare your behavior over time with these patterns of inappropriate behavior and, if you have engaged in inappropriate behavior, make a decision as to the consequences for you of your behavior. This primarily helps us enforce our rules and policies, secure the Riot Services, detect and prevent unauthorized activity, and maintain the competitive integrity of our games.</p>
<p>Our complaints procedure may allow you to appeal a decision. In this case, we may provide you with information that illustrates our rationale and factors that contributed to our decision, along with some tips on how to avoid repeating such behavior in the future. If you still wish to appeal, you may request one of our agents to review your case who will make a final manual determination as to the correct outcome based on the available evidence.</p>
<p>Please be kind to other players, observe our policies related to player behavior (including our <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>), and always be thoughtful about how you communicate with others!</p>
<h3 id="id.lrsx17ek1hak">E. Anti-Cheat &amp; Fraud Prevention</h3>
<p>We always seek to offer players a fair, fun, and competitive gaming experience on the Riot Services. Our <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> strictly prohibit use of unauthorized third-party programs that interact with the Riot Services, including mods, hacks, cheats, scripts, bots, trainers, and automation programs. When you create or use a Riot Games account, purchase things from us, play our games, or otherwise interact with the Riot Services, we may use anti-cheat and fraud prevention technologies (such as anti-cheat software that may run in the background of your device), that may make automated decisions (such as temporary or permanent account suspensions, communications restrictions, removal of content, or limited access to game content) based on the info we collect from or about you (see <a href="#id.1dw1dy112b4n">Info We Collect</a>). We engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, to comply with a legal obligation (e.g. to keep the Riot Services secure), and/or because we have a legitimate interest (e.g. understanding how the Riot Services are used, keeping them secure, and improving them).</p>

<header><h2 id="id.aftaryeityq3">VI. YOUR RIGHTS, CHOICES AND CONTROLS</h2></header>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> You have rights and choices regarding your use of the Riot Services and the ways we process info. Since you can interact with us in many different ways, the particular controls available to you often depend on the nature of our relationship.</p>
<div class="ui-accordion">
<p class="accordion-header content-right" style="display:block;">
<a href="#info"><strong>Expand</strong></a>
</p>
<div class="ui-accordion-content" style="display:none;">
<p>You can use many parts of the Riot Services without ever creating an account, purchasing our products or services, or otherwise submitting info like your name or email address to us. If you do choose to visit or use the Riot Services, we generally retain the related personal information as long as your account is active or as is otherwise necessary to provide the Riot Services, operate our business (including for legitimate purposes like complying with our legal obligations, managing internal books and records, preventing fraud, resolving disputes, and enforcing our contracts and terms, such as this notice and the <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>) or to achieve the purposes set out in this notice, unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by law.</p>
<p>The precise periods for which we keep your personal information vary depending on the nature of the information, why we need it and relevant legal or operational retention needs. Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to a contract or other matter, whether the personal information has been aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria. For example, the retention period applicable for your personal data needed to provide the Riot service to you (such as accessing the games) is limited to your account life. When your account is deleted, Riot will delete the relevant information for that purpose (providing the service to you) but will keep some personal information (Summoner Name or Riot ID, for instance) for other defined purposes such as security and fraud detection. As another example, communications logs/history data is retained at minimum for a period of time sufficient to allow any complaints to be filed after a match, and if such a complaint is filed, for a period of up to two years from their creation or a period of time sufficient to investigate the complaint. This is to enable Riot to properly investigate infringements of our rules and policies such as fraud, cheating and disruptive behavior.</p>
<p>You can also limit the info you share with third parties, such as by choosing not to link your Riot Games account with third-party services (see <a href="#id.a9o261d0hqs8">Third-Party Websites and Services</a>).</p>
<p>We offer players choices about the types of communications they receive from Riot Games. If you choose to receive marketing and promotional emails from us but later change your mind, simply “unsubscribe” by following the instructions in the relevant email. These choices don’t apply to mandatory communications that are part of the Riot Services, like important account-related notices.</p>
<p>The Riot Services also have many built-in tools to help players exercise control over their info directly. For example, you can generally mute or disable voice or text communication functionality and change other preferences from your account settings. If you need help with any of these options, be sure to <a href="#id.rfzoi2kyzx80">Contact Us</a>.</p>
<p>Many Internet browsers allow you to reject, manage, and delete cookies. You may also be able to manage other similar technologies, like HTML5, by changing your browser settings (see <a href="#id.2u7xlv9ncnkx">Info We Collect Automatically</a>).</p>
<p>If you don’t want to take advantage of the services that third-party analytics and advertising companies provide on the Riot Services, you may be able to opt out (or opt in if you are in the EU) of some of them by visiting <a href="https://youradchoices.com/" target="_blank">YourAdChoices.com</a> or <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank">Optout.NetworkAdvertising.org</a>, or if you’re located in the EU or Canada, <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">YourOnlineChoices.eu</a> or <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/" target="_blank">YourAdChoices.ca</a> respectively.

<p>If you’re concerned with the way we’re handling your info, or if you would like to request to access, correct, update, restrict or delete your personal info, object to or opt out of the processing of your personal info, withdraw your consent to our use of your info, or if you would like to request a copy of your personal info for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent these rights are provided to you by applicable law), please <a href="#id.rfzoi2kyzx80">Contact Us</a>. Your right to object includes where we process your info for direct marketing, for performing a task in the public interest or pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party. You can also learn more about <a href="https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001299888-Requesting-Your-Account-Data" target="_blank">how to request access to your account info</a>, or about <a href="https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202647784-Account-Deletion-FAQ" target="_blank">how to delete your account</a>. You also have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights.</p>
<p>If you withdraw your consent (including for marketing purposes), it does not affect the lawfulness of what we did up until that point.</p>
<p>Before we process such requests, we may ask you to verify your identity (like by logging-in to your account or providing us with certain info to help us confirm ownership) and we may request payment where allowed by law. Note that asking us to remove personal info or refrain from processing it may also result in account suspension or termination where this info is necessary to make Riot Services available to you (we normally tell you this at the point we collect the info), in which case you’ll no longer be able to access those Riot Services. We may also retain certain info associated with your account for purposes like complying with our legal obligations, managing internal books and records, preventing fraud, resolving disputes, and enforcing our contracts and terms, such as this notice and the <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re in the EEA/UK, you may lodge a complaint with an EU/UK/EEA data protection authority for your country or region where an alleged infringement of applicable data protection law occurs. Riot Games lead supervisory authority under the GDPR is the <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/" target="_blank">Irish Data Protection Commission</a> [dataprotection.ie].</p>
<p>If you’re in Australia, please note that you generally have the right to deal with us anonymously or using a pseudonym (unless it’s not practicable for us to deal with you on this basis). Also, please <a href="#id.rfzoi2kyzx80">Contact Us</a> if you would like to complain that we have breached the Australian Privacy Principles or any applicable code.</p>
