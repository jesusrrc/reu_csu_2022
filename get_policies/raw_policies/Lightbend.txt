<h3>Security</h3>
<p>In order to protect your personal data we have implemented reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the personal data we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. Your personal data is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of people, who have special access rights and are required to keep the personal data confidential.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that no website or internet transmission is completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal data safe, such as closing your web browser when finished using the Sites.</p>
<h3>Children Under The Age Of 16</h3>
<p>Our Sites and Services are not directed to anyone under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from minors under the age of 16.</p>
<h3>Use Of Cookies</h3>
<p>We and our third party providers use cookies, clear GIFs/pixel tags, JavaScript, local storage, log files, and other mechanisms to automatically collect and record information about your browsing activities, and use of the Sites and Services. We may combine this “activity information” with other personal data we collect about you where permitted by law.</p>
<p>Generally, we use this activity information to understand how our Sites and Services are used, track bugs and errors, improve our Sites and Services, verify account credentials, allow logins, track sessions, prevent fraud, and protect our Sites and Services, as well as to conduct  targeted marketing and advertising, to personalize content, and to perform analytics. For more detailed information about these mechanisms and how we collect activity information, see our <a href="/legal/cookie">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Analytics Tools.</strong> Our Sites use automated devices and applications operated by third parties (e.g., Google Analytics), which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Sites and report on activities and trends. Please see our <a href="/legal/cookie">Cookie Policy</a> for more information. </p>
<h3>Interest-based Advertising</h3>
<p>On some of our websites, we may work with third-party ad networks, analytics companies, measurement services and others (“third-party ad companies”) to display advertising on our Sites and to manage our advertising on third-party sites, mobile apps and online services. We and these third-party ad companies may use cookies, pixels tags and other tools to collect information on our Sites (and on third-party sites and services), such as browsing history, IP address, device ID, cookie and advertising IDs, and other identifiers, general location information and, with your consent, your device’s geolocation information. We and these third-party ad companies may use this information to provide you more relevant ads and content and to evaluate the success of such ads and content.</p>
<p>You can manage your preferences regarding third party ad company cookies deployed on our Site by using our <a onclick="OneTrust.ToggleInfoDisplay();">cookie preference manager</a>.</p>
<p>Please see our Cookie Policy for information about the third parties we may work with to display targeted ads on third-party sites and to measure the success of our marketing and campaigns. You may also obtain more information about targeted or “interest-based advertising” and opt-out of many ad networks at the industry websites below:</p>
<p>Canada:  www.youradchoices.ca <br/>
					EU:  www.youronlinechoices.eu <br/>
					U.S.:  www.aboutads.info</p>
<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>We will generally retain the personal data we processed through our Sites and Services for as long as it is required for purposes for which the data were collected. Unless we inform you otherwise, this will usually be the period of 3 years after the last interaction with you plus the length of any applicable statutory retention period following such activity.</p>
<h3>International Transfers</h3>
<p>Your personal data may be transferred to -and maintained on- computers located outside of your state, province, country or governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the USA, please note that the personal data you provide (as described above under "What Personal Data Do We Collect") will be transferred to the USA, where the level of data protection may not be equivalent to the level of protection applicable at your location.</p>
<p>Where we are legally required to do so, transfers of personal data to parties outside the EU/EEA may be made pursuant to the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses or other legally acceptable mechanisms that ensure an adequate level of protection. Where applicable, you are entitled to receive a copy of the relevant contract (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Binding Corporate Rules) showing that appropriate safeguards have been taken to protect your personal data during such transfer.</p>
<h3>How You Can Contact Us</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or if you would like to make a complaint about a possible breach of local privacy laws, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@lightbend.com">privacy@lightbend.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Links To Other Websites</h3>
<p>For your convenience and to improve the usage of the Sites we insert links to third parties, for which this Privacy Policy does not apply. These links take you outside our service and off the Lightbend Sites and are beyond our control. The sites you can link to have their own separate privacy policy and, although we seek to protect the integrity of our Sites, Lightbend is not responsible and cannot be held liable for the content and activities of these sites. Your visit/access to these sites is therefore entirely at your own risk. Please note that these other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal data.</p>
<h3>Changes To The Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time. If a fundamental change to the nature of the use of your personal data is involved or if the change is in any other manner relevant to you, we will ensure that information is provided to you well in advance of the change actually taking effect.</p>
<h3>Additional Information for Residents in Certain Jurisdictions</h3>
<p>In this section, we provide additional information to California residents about how we handle their personal information, as required under California privacy laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act (“<strong>CCPA</strong>”). This section does not address or apply to our handling of publicly available information lawfully made available by state or federal government records or other personal information that is exempt under the CCPA.  Importantly, this section also does not apply to our handling of customer data (including any personal information contained therein) that is uploaded to the Site or that is provided as part of the Service, where we are acting as a service provider or processor (depending on applicable privacy law).</p>
<h3>A. California Privacy Disclosures</h3>

While we do not disclose personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary compensation, we may disclose or make available certain categories of personal information to third parties in order to receive certain benefits or services, such as when we make browsing information available to third party ad companies (through third party tags on our Websites) in order to improve and measure our ad campaigns and reach users with more relevant ads and content. As defined by the CCPA, we may “sell” Usage Data and Identifiers to third party advertising networks, social networks and data analytics providers.  To opt of our sale of your personal information, you may click on  <a onclick="OneTrust.ToggleInfoDisplay();">Do Not Sell My Info</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sources:</strong> We collect the above categories of personal data from the sources described in Sources of Personal Data We Collect (above) and for the purposes described in Purposes For Which We Use Personal Data (above).</p>
