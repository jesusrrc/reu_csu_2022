<h2>How Cavli Collects Data</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cavli collects certain data from visitors to Cavli Websites in order to continuously improve
                            and enhance our customer’s experiences. This data is collected via the following methods:
                        </li>
<li>Cavli, like many other websites, will store session information (often called “Cookies”) in
                            your browser that will help Cavli to identify information such as browsing activity, IP
                            addresses and page view order. You do have the option to not use these Cookies; the majority
                            of browsers will have a “help” tool that will help you to prevent Cookies if you want to,
                            but Cavli recommends you keep Cookies active as it will provide a better user experience on
                            Cavli’s Websites.</li>
<li>When You visit Cavli Websites, Cavli web servers automatically log typical website analytic
                            data from visitors to our site. This data, which may include details such as browser type,
                            IP addresses, site visit length and referral URL, is used for systems administration,
                            detecting use patterns and generally improving customer experience.</li>
<li>Cavli sees and logs non-personally identifiable data when You use Cavli Services. Cavli logs
                            this data in our system and stores it on Third-Party servers. The only identifiable
                            information this data is connected to will be the account details You supplied when creating
                            Your account.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treatment of Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
<li>When You create an account with Cavli, You provide us with data that includes an email
                            address and password. Cavli may also give you the option to voluntarily share other data
                            with us that is connected to your account. If any of these details change, You may update
                            your account at any time and modify, correct or delete your account details.</li>
<li>If you are using Cavli to connect a Product to the Cavli Cloud, You will be required to
                            identify a network and corresponding network password. This information exists only locally,
                            and Cavli does not have access to it. When You connect a Product, a specific Product ID will
                            be sent to the Cavli Cloud, after which Cavli will be able to match a specific device ID to
                            Your account details.</li>
<li>You may choose to contribute and interact on Cavli Websites including the Project Share Site
                            and forum Website. You will have the opportunity to choose what information (other than Your
                            user name which is not optional) you would like to make public. You may choose whether to
                            display or give out your contact details and other personally identifiable information on
                            the Websites.</li>
<li>When You actively provide information on Cavli Websites, for example when You post, message
                            or interact on the Cavli Hubble site, Cavli may retain that data for You for later use. This
                            data is stored on secure third-party servers.</li>
<li>You may actively provide payment details when purchasing Products from Cavli. Cavli uses a
                            third-party secure e-commerce site with a Level 1 PCI compliant payment system, for direct
                            online sales. No employees of Cavli have access to the credit card details associated with
                            these purchases.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information provided by third parties</h2>
<ul>
<li>At times Cavli may collect information from Third-Parties that use our Services or Products.
                            They may provide us with Personal or Anonymous Data that we will use to continue to improve
                            our Services and Products.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How is data used by Cavli?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The data referenced in this Privacy Policy is primarily used by Cavli to improve,
                            troubleshoot and enhance Products, Websites and Services.</li>
<li>Email addresses and any other information supplied by You may also be used by Cavli to
                            respond to emails, phone calls and requests. In addition, Cavli may use the data that
                            identifies the Product IDs associated with Your account to provide information and technical
                            assistance to You. For example, Your email address and device details may be used to respond
                            to a technical support question that You send to Cavli.</li>
<li>Cavli may collect and create anonymous data by excluding personally identifiable
                            information. Cavli reserves the right to use Anonymous Data for any purpose and disclose
                            Anonymous Data to third parties at its sole discretion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How is data kept secure?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cavli uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption on the APIs (Application Programming
                            Interface) and Websites operated by Cavli.</li>
<li>Cavli uses RSA and AES encryption to communicate with Products.</li>
<li>Data collected by Cavli via its Websites and Services is stored on secure third-party
                            servers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When is data shared?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cavli may at some point have a third-party process or analyze some of the data we have
                            collected.</li>
<li>When appropriate, Cavli may share data with entities and persons who are actively doing
                            business with Cavli and have entered into a contract with Cavalier Wireless Inc. DBA Cavli
                            (such as companies that have created “Powered by Cavli” products). A company of this sort
                            will have access to the data generated by individuals who are users of the product created
                            and sold by said company.</li>
<li>Cavli may share aggregated or anonymous data publicly or as described above in section 3.3
                        </li>
<li>
                            Cavli will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside
                            of Cavli if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the
                            information is reasonably necessary to:
                            <ul>
<li style="list-style: circle;">Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
                                    enforceable governmental request.</li>

                                    investigation of potential violations.</li>
<li style="list-style: circle;">Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or
                                    technical issues.</li>
<li style="list-style: circle;">Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety
                                    of Cavli, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If another company acquires Cavli or our assets via a merger, acquisition or sale, that
                            company will possess the Personal Data collected by Cavli and will assume the rights and
                            obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy. In this event
                            Cavli will give You prior notification via email or by putting a prominent notice on our
                            site before Your personal data is transferred.</li>
