This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Dassault Systèmes S.E. and its <a href="https://www.3ds.com/about-3ds/contact-information">affiliates</a> (together “3DS”) related to personal data collected, used, stored and otherwise processed.</p>
<p>Please be aware that some supplemental country terms may be applicable as detailed at the end of this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p>When you use a 3DS cloud offering ordered by your employer or school, the processing of your personal data is determined and administered by its own privacy statement and not by this privacy policy. Should you have any concern about how and why your personal data is processed within this framework, please refer to your employer or school as the case may be. </p>
<p>In addition, 3DS only collects personal data from children, who are considered minors under the applicable data protection law, with the prior consent of their parents or guardians. Such consent is required before a minor can create a user profile or use any 3DS products or services. If the child is a minor they must provide an email address for their parent or guardian to receive a message from 3DS instructing them on how to provide their consent. Schools should always ensure that they have received permission from parents or guardians to do so. Parents or guardians can ask 3DS to review the personal data collected about their child, to remove it and terminate the child’s account or make any other request regarding their child’s personal data by submitting a request via <a href="https://www.3ds.com/privacy-policy/contact/">https://www.3ds.com/privacy-policy/contact</a> whether or not they gave consent to collect their child’s personal data. If 3DS learns that it has collected personal data from a child, it will delete that information as quickly as possible unless his or her authorized representative is willing to ratify the situation.</p>
<p>For your convenience, hyperlinks may be posted on the 3DS websites or apps that link to other websites or apps that 3DS does not own or control. This privacy policy is not applicable to them and 3DS has no liability for the content of third-party websites nor the personal data they collect.</p>
