</div>
<div class="zfctm-intro-text">We collect certain information every time you visit our ZF Websites. This information is used for the purposes which we list below. The specific types of personal data we collect depend upon your activities on the ZF Websites, as also further explained below. </div>
<div class="zfctm-text-copy">
<p><b>1.1 Information that is automatically collected</b></p><p>When you use the ZF Websites without registration, you are not required to actively provide certain personal data; however, we automatically collect and process the following information: </p><p>technical session and connection information including IP address of your device; browser type; information about your device, hardware and software; preferences; web pages you visited just before the ZF Websites; pages you viewed on the ZF Websites and dates and times of your visit. </p><p>We process and use the data specified above for the purposes of (1) providing the ZF Websites and its functionalities; (2) improving the ZF Website’s features and functionalities; and (3) preventing and detecting misuse and malfunction of the ZF Websites including troubleshooting.</p><p>Collection of this type of information occurs inter alia by means of cookies. For more detailed information on the types of cookies and their specific purposes, please see Sec. 2 below. </p><p>The processing and use of the data is based on statutory provisions which justify those operations on the grounds that (1) the processing is necessary for the performance of the contract about the use of the ZF Websites; or (2) ZF has a legitimate interest in ensuring the functionality and error-free operation of the ZF Websites and that it is tailored to the user’s needs. </p><p><b>1.2 User requests, account creation and signing-in </b></p><p>When you create a ZF Account (which is required for some parts of the ZF Websites), we collect the information you provide in the registration process, which may include:</p><p>First name and surname, sex, email address, phone numbers, area of activity, industry category, name and type of your organisation, company’s address.</p><p>The same data is processed when the user fills in the contact form on the website, e.g. the user sends a request for technical information.</p><p>We process and use the information specified above for the purposes of (1) checking your eligibility for and the administration of your ZF Account; (2) performing the Terms of Use regarding the ZF Websites and any and all rights and obligations thereunder; (3) tailoring the ZF Websites and the content to your needs; and (4) communicating with you by sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages, respond to your questions and requests and provide customer service. </p><p>The processing and use of the data is based on statutory provisions which justify those operations on the grounds that (1) the processing is necessary for the performance of the Agreement including the Terms of Use regarding the ZF Websites; or (2) ZF has a legitimate interest in ensuring the functionality of the ZF Websites and that it is tailored to the user’s needs.</p><p>If you create or log in to a ZF Account we use your login data (user name and password) for the purpose of providing and administrating your access to the ZF Websites and – as the case maybe – further online services by ZF or third parties which are accessible through the ZF Websites. The information you provide in order to register (user name and password) is processed to check and verify your authorisation and to handle requests from you to reset your password.</p><p><b>1.3 Personal data from other sources: Social media plugins and networks </b></p><p>When using our ZF Websites we allow you to share information with social media sites or to connect your ZF account with the respective social media site using so-called social plugins. Social networks are able to retrieve personal data, independently of whether you interact with the plugin or not.</p><p>For this reason, when we use social plugins on our websites from social networks we integrate them in the following way: When you visit our websites, the social plugins are deactivated, i.e. no data is transmitted to the operators of these networks. If you want to use one of the networks, click on the respective social plugin to establish a direct connection to the server of the respective network. If you are logged onto a social network while visiting ZF Websites with social media plugins embedded in them, the network can collect and store information about such visit and link it to your social media user account. If you want to avoid this, please log out of the network before activating the social plugin. Once you log out, the data retrieved from your visit to the ZF Websites cannot be combined with the data of your social network user account.</p><p>ZF has no control over the data collected by social media networks through its plugins. We encourage you to read their privacy policies to learn more about the use and function of social media plugins, the categories of data collected, the purposes it is collected for as well as the social networks’ overall data protection practices.</p><p>Social plugins of Facebook<br/>Facebook is provided by Facebook Inc., 1601 S.

In those cases we collect personal data from your social media user account consisting of your first and last name, email address and phone number and any other information you have made public. </p><p>We process and use the information specified above for the purposes of improving the ZF Websites’ features and functionalities, as well as for offering you a personalised service. </p><p>The processing and use of the data is based on statutory provisions which justify those operations on the grounds that ZF has a legitimate interest in ensuring that the functionality of the ZF Websites is tailored to the user’s needs, for targeted marketing purposes and for market research. </p><p>You can restrict our access to your personal data by changing your privacy settings on the respective social media sites.</p><p><b>1.4 Further services</b></p><p>You may provide further information to us when you order further services through the ZF Websites; such information may include: delivery address; payment information, etc. The collection and use of such additional information is governed by a separate Data Processing Information for the particular service.</p>
