                    <p><i>Last updated: March 16, 2020
</i><p>This Cookie Statement explains how SST.com, a Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) company and its group companies (collectively &ldquo;Microchip&rdquo;, "we", "us", and "ours") use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our websites, including those at www.sst.com, www.microchip.com or any successor URLs, and any mobile or localized versions and sub-domains ("Websites"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them. Except as otherwise stated in this Cookies Statement, to the extent any personal information is collected through cookies or similar technologies, SST&rsquo;s Privacy Policy applies.</p><p><i><b>What are cookies?</b></i></p><p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p><p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Microchip) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and when it visits certain other websites.</p><p><i><b>Why do we use cookies?
</b></i></p><p>We use first party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Websites. Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p><p>The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in the table below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Website you visit):</p><p></p><table class="table"> <tr>

Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p><p><i><b>How can I control cookies?
</b></i></p><p>You may exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided in the cookie table above if your browser is supported by the respective opt-out functionality.</p><p>
You may be able to set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies (most Internet browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings). If you choose to reject
cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.</p><p>In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.</p><p><i><b>How often will you update this Cookie Statement?
</b></i></p><p>We may update this Cookie Statement from time to time to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Statement regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.</p><p>The date at the top of this Cookie Statement indicates when it was last updated.</p><p><i><b>Where can I get further information?
