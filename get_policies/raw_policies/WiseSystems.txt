<li><strong>3.2</strong> As you will know, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information during transmission, and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9. California related rights</h3>
<p><a name="chapter9.1"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>9.1 California Consumer Privacy Act Notice</strong>
In this notice, we are addressing the disclosure requirements under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA) for California residents. This notice should be read together with our Privacy Statement and applies to all California residents who visit our Website or use our Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personal Data Collection and Purposes of Use:</strong> We collect, use and share the personal data of California residents as described above.
<a name="chapter9.2"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>9.2 California Consumer Privacy Act</strong>
Now that you know how we collect, use and share your personal information, the CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. In addition, the California Shine the Light law (CA Civ. Code § 1798.83) requires us to provide California residents with, upon their request, the names and addresses of third parties who have received personal information and the categories of personal information shared.
California residents have the right to request that Wise US Inc. discloses what personal information Wise has collected, used, disclosed, and sold over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you the necessary information in a portable and easily accessible format, normally within 45 days of request. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice in a 12-month period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When providing information under the right to know, we will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The categories of personal information the business collects about the consumer and has disclosed or sold for a business purpose</li>
<li>The categories of sources of the consumer’s personal information</li>
<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting and selling the consumer’s personal information</li>
<li>The categories of any third parties with whom the business shares the consumer’s personal information or to whom personal information is sold</li>
<li>The specific pieces of personal information collected about the consumer</li>
</ul>
<p>California residents also have the right to request the deletion of their personal data, subject to certain exceptions, and may not be discriminated against because they exercise their rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act. We may require you to provide additional personal data to verify your identity before we process your request; we may not process your request if we are unable to verify your identity.</p>
<p>California residents also have the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information. <strong>In the preceding twelve (12) months Wise has not sold any personal information.</strong></p>
<p>If you are a California resident and would like to make a request, please submit your request, in writing, to:</p>
<p>Wise US Inc.<br/>
