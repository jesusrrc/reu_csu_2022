                  to broadcast the information in your resume and profile widely
                  in order to maximize your career opportunities. The
                  information we gather may be shared within the Talentcloud.ai

                  <span>We do not share information with third parties for their

<div class="policy_content_info">
                  1. We share your information with third parties who help
                  deliver our products and services to you. Examples include
                  hosting our web servers, including resume database storage,
                  analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing
                  credit card payments, and providing customer service. These
                  companies will have access to your personal information as
                  necessary to perform their functions, but they may not use
                  that data for any other purpose. We will remain responsible
                  for any information shared in this way.
                </div>
<div class="policy_content_info">
                  2. We may disclose information to third parties if you
                  consent. For example:
                </div>
<div class="policy_content_info">
                  (a) if you make your resume searchable, then all parties with

                  your resume;

                  supply your contact information to those third parties so they

                </div>
<div class="policy_content_info">
                  (c) if you previously chose to receive newsletters, commercial

                  parties, but subsequently change your mind, you may opt out in

                  information to that employer.

                  entity or if we believe in good faith after considering your

                  whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or

                  An Important Note About Your Resume

<div class="policy_content_info">
                  When you create or post a resume, we store it in our
                  searchable resume database in the United States. You may
                  control the status of your resume by setting it to visible,
                  limited, or private. Visible and limited resumes can be found
                  by anyone with access to our resume database. We cannot
                  control the retention, use or privacy of resumes that have
                  been viewed or downloaded by others.
                </div>
<div class="policy_content_info">
                  Private resumes will not be searchable in our resume database.
                  You may still use your private resume to apply online to a
                  job.
                  <span>If you do, your resume will be transferred to the relevant
                    employer, who may retain a copy of your resume or distribute
                    it to third parties.</span>
</div>
<div class="policy_content_info">

                  copy which is not accessible by you or third parties on the

                  periodic basis. Our current expiration period is approximately
                  36 months; we may extend or reduce this period in order to
