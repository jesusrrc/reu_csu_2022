<h3><span>Legal Bases for the Processing</span></h3>
<p><span>In the following, you will find an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on which we base the processing of personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection provisions of your or our country of residence or domicile may apply. If, in addition, more specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.</span></p>
<p><span>Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)</span></strong><span> - The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR)</span></strong><span> - Performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR)</span></strong><span> - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR)</span></strong><span> - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Job application process as a pre-contractual or contractual relationship (Article 9 (2)(b) GDPR)</span></strong><span> - If special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9 (1) GDPR (e.g. health data, such as severely handicapped status or ethnic origin) are requested from applicants within the framework of the application procedure, so that the responsible person or the person concerned can carry out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject in the field of employment and social security and social protection law, their processing shall be carried out in accordance with Article 9 (2)(b) GDPR , in the case of the protection of vital interests of applicants or other persons on the basis of Article 9 (2)(c) GDPRÂ  or for the purposes of preventive health care or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the employee's ability to work, for medical diagnostics, care or treatment in the health or social sector or for the administration of systems and services in the health or social sector in accordance with Article 9 (2)(d) GDPR. In the case of a communication of special categories of data based on voluntary consent, their processing is carried out on the basis of Article 9 (2)(a) GDPR.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Â </span></p>
<h2><span>Security Precautions</span></h2>
<p><span>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account theÂ  state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.</span></p>
<p><span>The measures include in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input, transmission, securing and separation of the data. In addition, we have established procedures to ensure that data subjects' rights are respected, that data is erased, and that we are prepared to respond to data threats rapidly. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software, and service providers, in accordance with the principle of privacy by design and privacy by default.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Masking of the IP address</span></strong><span>: If IP addresses are processed by us or by the service providers and technologies used and the processing of a complete IP address is not necessary, the IP address is shortened (also referred to as "IP masking"). In this process, the last two digits or the last part of the IP address after a full stop are removed or replaced by wildcards. The masking of the IP address is intended to prevent the identification of a person by means of their IP address or to make such identification significantly more difficult.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>SSL encryption (https)</span></strong><span>: To protect your data transmitted via our online services in the best possible way, we use SSL encryption. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address bar of your browser. </span></p>
<h2><span>Transmission of Personal Data</span></h2>
<p><span>In the context of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to other places, companies, or persons or that it is disclosed to them. Recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are embedded in a website. In such a case, the legal requirements will be respected and in particular corresponding contracts or agreements, which serve the protection of your data, will be concluded with the recipients of your data.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Data Transmission within the Group of Companies</span></strong><span>: We may transfer personal data to other companies within our group of companies or otherwise grant them access to this data. Insofar as this disclosure is for administrative purposes, the disclosure of the data is based on our legitimate business and economic interests or otherwise, if it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations or if the consent of the data subjects or otherwise a legal permission is present.</span></p>
<h2><span>Data Processing in Third Countries</span></h2>
<p><span>If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of third party services or disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this will only take place in accordance with the legal requirements. </span></p>
<p><span>Subject to express consent or transfer required by contract or law, we process or have processed the data only in third countries with a recognized level of data protection, on the basis of special guarantees, such as a contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission or if certifications or binding internal data protection regulations justify the processing (Article 44 to 49 GDPR, information page of the EU Commission: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en</a>).</span></p>
<h2><span>Erasure of data</span></h2>
<p><span>The data processed by us will be erased in accordance with the statutory provisions as soon as their processing is revoked or other permissions no longer apply (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data no longer applies or they are not required for the purpose).</span></p>
<p><span>If the data is not deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing is limited to these purposes. This means that the data will be restricted and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be stored for commercial or tax reasons or for which storage is necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.</span></p>
<p><span>In the context of our information on data processing, we may provide users with further information on the deletion and retention of data that is specific to the respective processing operation.</span></p>
<h2><span>Use of Cookies</span></h2>
<p><span>Cookies are text files that contain data from visited websites or domains and are stored by a browser on the user's computer. A cookie is primarily used to store information about a user during or after his visit within an online service. The information stored can include, for example, the language settings on a website, the login status, a shopping basket or the location where a video was viewed. The term "cookies" also includes other technologies that fulfil the same functions as cookies (e.g. if user information is stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, also referred to as "user IDs").</span></p>
<p><strong><span>The following types and functions of cookies are distinguished:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Temporary cookies (also: session cookies):Â </span></strong><span>Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online service and closed his browser.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Permanent cookies:</span></strong><span>Â Permanent cookies remain stored even after closing the browser. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. The interests of users who are used for range measurement or marketing purposes can also be stored in such a cookie.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>First-Party-Cookies</span></strong><span>: First-Party-Cookies are set by ourselves.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Third party cookies</span></strong><span>: Third party cookies are mainly used by advertisers (so-called third parties) to process user information.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Necessary (also: essential) cookies:</span></strong><span> Cookies can be necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to save logins or other user inputs or for security reasons).</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Statistics, marketing and personalization cookies</span></strong><span>: Cookies are also generally used to measure a website's reach and when a user's interests or behavior (e.g. viewing certain content, using functions, etc.) are stored on individual websites in a user profile. Such profiles are used, for example, to display content to users that corresponds to their potential interests. This procedure is also referred to as "tracking", i.e. tracking the potential interests of users. If we use cookies or "tracking" technologies, we will inform you separately in our privacy policy or in the context of obtaining consent.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span>Information on legal basis:</span></strong><span> The legal basis on which we process your personal data with the help of cookies depends on whether we ask you for your consent. If this applies and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for processing your data is your declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of cookies will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in a business operation of our online service and its improvement) or, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Retention period: </span></strong><span>Unless we provide you with explicit information on the retention period of permanent cookies (e.g. within the scope of a so-called cookie opt-in), please assume that the retention period can be as long as two years.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>General information on Withdrawal of consent and objection (Opt-Out): </span></strong><span>Respective of whether processing is based on consent or legal permission, you have the option at any time to object to the processing of your data using cookie technologies or to revoke consent (collectively referred to as "opt-out"). You can initially explain your objection using the settings of your browser, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies (which may also restrict the functionality of our online services). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can be raised for a large number of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the websites <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/">https://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> and <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com">https://www.youronlinechoices.com.</a> In addition, you can receive further information on objections in the context of the information on the used service providers and cookies.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Processing Cookie Data on the Basis of Consent</span></strong><span>: We use a cookie management solution in which users' consent to the use of cookies, or the procedures and providers mentioned in the cookie management solution, can be obtained, managed and revoked by the users. The declaration of consent is stored so that it does not have to be retrieved again and the consent can be proven in accordance with the legal obligation. Storage can take place server-sided and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-out cookie or with the aid of comparable technologies) in order to be able to assign the consent to a user or and/or his/her device. Subject to individual details of the providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: The duration of the storage of the consent can be up to two years. In this case, a pseudonymous user identifier is formed and stored with the date/time of consent, information on the scope of the consent (e.g. which categories of cookies and/or service providers) as well as the browser, system and used end device.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Processed data types:</span></strong><span> Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), Meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Data subjects:</span></strong><span> Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Legal Basis:</span></strong><span> Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR), Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).</span></li>

<p><strong><span>Services and service providers being used:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Cookiebot:</span></strong><span> Cookie-Consent Manager; Service provider: Cybot A/S, Havnegade 39, 1058 Copenhagen, Denmark; Website: <a href="https://www.cookiebot.com">https://www.cookiebot.com</a>; Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.cookiebot.com/en/privacy-policy/">https://www.cookiebot.com/en/privacy-policy/</a>; Stored data (on the server of the service provider): The IP number of the user in anonymous form (the last three digits are set to 0), date and time of the consent, user agent of the user's browser, the URL from which the consent was sent, An anonymous, random and encrypted key value; the consent status of the user.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Business services</span></h2>
<p><span>We process data of our contractual and business partners, e.g. customers and interested parties (collectively referred to as "contractual partners") within the context of contractual and comparable legal relationships as well as associated actions and communication with the contractual partners or pre-contractually, e.g. to answer inquiries.</span></p>
<p><span>We process this data in order to fulfil our contractual obligations, safeguard our rights and for the purposes of the administrative tasks associated with this data and the business-related organization. We will only pass on the data of the contractual partners within the scope of the applicable law to third parties insofar as this is necessary for the aforementioned purposes or for the fulfilment of legal obligations or with the consent of data subjects concerned (e.g. telecommunications, transport and other auxiliary services as well as subcontractors, banks, tax and legal advisors, payment service providers or tax authorities). The contractual partners will be informed about further processing, e.g. for marketing purposes, as part of this privacy policy.</span></p>
<p><span>Which data are necessary for the aforementioned purposes, we inform the contracting partners before or in the context of the data collection, e.g. in online forms by special marking (e.g. colors), and/or symbols (e.g. asterisks or the like), or personally.</span></p>
<p><span>We delete the data after expiry of statutory warranty and comparable obligations, i.e. in principle after expiry of 4 years, unless the data is stored in a customer account or must be kept for legal reasons of archiving (e.g., as a rule 10 years for tax purposes). In the case of data disclosed to us by the contractual partner within the context of an assignment, we delete the data in accordance with the specifications of the assignment, in general after the end of the assignment.</span></p>
<p><span>If we use third-party providers or platforms to provide our services, the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or platforms shall apply in the relationship between the users and the providers.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Customer Account</span></strong><span>: Contractual partners can create a customer or user account. If the registration of a customer account is required, contractual partners will be informed of this as well as of the details required for registration. The customer accounts are not public and cannot be indexed by search engines. In the course of registration and subsequent registration and use of the customer account, we store the IP addresses of the contractual partners along with the access times, in order to be able to prove the registration and prevent any misuse of the customer account.</span></p>
<p><span>If customers have terminated their customer account, their data will be deleted with regard to the customer account, subject to their retention is required for legal reasons. It is the responsibility of the customer to secure their data upon termination of the customer account.</span></p>

The required details are identified as such in the course of the ordering or comparable purchasing process and include the details required for delivery, or other way of making the product available and invoicing as well as contact information in order to be able to hold any consultation.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Project and Development Services</span></strong><span>: We process the data of our customers and clients (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "customers") in order to enable them to select, acquire or commission the selected services or works as well as associated activities and to pay for and make available such services or works or to perform such services or works.</span></p>
<p><span>The required information is indicated as such within the framework of the conclusion of the agreement, order or equivalent contract and includes the information required for the provision of services and invoicing as well as contact information in order to be able to hold any consultations. Insofar as we gain access to the information of end customers, employees or other persons, we process it in accordance with the legal and contractual requirements.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Further information on commercial services</span></strong><span>: We process the data of our customers and clients (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "customers") in order to enable them to select, acquire or commission the selected services or works and related tasks, as well as their payment and delivery, or execution or provision.</span></p>

<h2><span>Provision of online services and web hosting</span></h2>
<p><span>In order to provide our online services securely and efficiently, we use the services of one or more web hosting providers from whose servers (or servers they manage) the online services can be accessed. For these purposes, we may use infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage space and database services, as well as security and technical maintenance services.</span></p>
<p><span>The data processed within the framework of the provision of the hosting services may include all information relating to the users of our online services that is collected in the course of use and communication. This regularly includes the IP address, which is necessary to be able to deliver the contents of online services to browsers, and all entries made within our online services or from websites.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>E-mail Sending and Hosting</span></strong><span>: The web hosting services we use also include sending, receiving, and storing e-mails. For these purposes, the addresses of the recipients and senders, as well as other information relating to the sending of e-mails (e.g. the providers involved) and the contents of the respective e-mails are processed. The above data may also be processed for SPAM detection purposes. Please note that e-mails on the Internet are generally not sent in encrypted form. As a rule, e-mails are encrypted during transport, but not on the servers from which they are sent and received (unless a so-called end-to-end encryption method is used). We can therefore accept no responsibility for the transmission path of e-mails between the sender and reception on our server.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Collection of Access Data and Log Files</span></strong><span>: We, ourselves or our web hosting provider, collect data on the basis of each access to the server (so-called server log files). Server log files may include the address and name of the web pages and files accessed, the date and time of access, data volumes transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a general rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider.</span></p>
<p><span>The server log files can be used for security purposes, e.g. to avoid overloading the servers (especially in the case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and to ensure the stability and optimal load balancing of the servers.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Processed data types:</span></strong><span> Content data (e.g. text input, photographs, videos), Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), Meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Data subjects:</span></strong><span> Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Purposes of Processing:</span></strong><span> Provision of our online services and usability.</span></li>

In addition, we refer to the data protection information in this privacy policy with regard to the processing of user data.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Legal basis:</span></strong><span> The processing of data necessary for the provision of the functionalities of the application serves to fulfil contractual obligations. This also applies if the provision of the functions requires user authorization (e.g. release of device functions).

This data will not be passed on to third parties unless it is necessary to pursue our claims or there is a legal obligation to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>Users may be informed by e-mail of information relevant to their user account, such as technical changes.</span></p>

<h2><span>Communication via Messenger</span></h2>
<p><span>We use messenger services for communication purposes and therefore ask you to observe the following information regarding the functionality of the messenger services, encryption, use of the metadata of the communication and your objection options.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also contact us by alternative means, e.g. telephone or e-mail. Please use the contact options provided to you or use the contact options provided within our online services.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of encryption of content (i.e. the content of your message and attachments), we point out that the communication content (i.e. the content of the message and attachments) is encrypted end-to-end. This means that the content of the messages is not visible, not even by the messenger service providers themselves. You should always use a current version of the messenger service with activated encryption, so that the encryption of the message contents is guaranteed. </span></p>
<p><span>However, we would like to point out to our communication partners that although messenger service providers do not see the content, they can find out that and when communication partners communicate with us and process technical information on the communication partner's device used and, depending on the settings of their device, also location information (so-called metadata). </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Information on Legal basis: </span></strong><span>Â If we ask communication partners for permission before communicating with them via messenger services, the legal basis of our processing of their data is their consent. Otherwise, if we do not request consent and you contact us, for example, voluntarily, we use messenger services in our dealings with our contractual partners and as part of the contract initiation process as a contractual measure and in the case of other interested parties and communication partners on the basis of our legitimate interests in fast and efficient communication and meeting the needs of our communication partners for communication via messenger services. We would also like to point out that we do not transmit the contact data provided to us to the messenger service providers for the first time without your consent.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Withdrawal, objection and deletion: </span></strong><span>Â You can withdraw your consent or object to communication with us via messenger services at any time. In the case of communication via messenger services, we delete the messages in accordance with our general data retention policy (i.e. as described above after the end of contractual relationships, archiving requirements, etc.) and otherwise as soon as we can assume that we have answered any information provided by the communication partners, if no reference to a previous conversation is to be expected and there are no legal obligations to store the messages to prevent their deletion.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Reservation of reference to other means of communication:</span></strong><span> Finally, we would like to point out that we reserve the right, for reasons of your safety, not to answer inquiries about messenger services. This is the case if, for example, internal contractual matters require special secrecy or if an answer via the messenger services does not meet the formal requirements. In such cases we refer you to more appropriate communication channels.</span></p>

<h2><span>Chatbots and chat functions</span></h2>
<p><span>We provide online chats and chatbot functions as a means of communication (together referred to as "Chat Services"). A chat is an online conversation that is conducted with a certain degree of immediacy. A chatbot is software that answers users' questions or informs them about messages. If you use our chat functions, we may process your personal data.</span></p>
<p><span>If you use our Chat Services within an online platform, your identification number is also stored within the respective platform. We may also collect information about which users interact with our Chat Services and when. Furthermore, we store the content of your conversations via the Chat Services and log registration and consent processes in order to be able to prove these in accordance with legal requirements. </span></p>
<p><span>We would like to inform users that the respective platform provider can find out that and when users communicate with our Chat Services and can collect technical information about the user's device used and, depending on the settings of their device, also location information (so-called metadata) for the purpose of optimizing the respective services and for security purposes. Likewise, the metadata of communication via Chat Services (i.e., information about who has communicated with whom) could be used by the respective platform providers for marketing purposes or to display advertising tailored to users in accordance with their regulations, to which we refer for further information.</span></p>
<p><span>If users agree to activate information with regular messages to a chatbot, they have the possibility to unsubscribe from the information for the future at any time. The chatbot points out to users how and with which terms they can unsubscribe the messages. By unsubscribing from the chatbot messages, Users' data is deleted from the directory of message recipients.</span></p>
<p><span>We use the aforementioned information to operate our Chat Services, e.g. to address users personally, to answer their inquiries, to transmit any requested content and also to improve our Chat Services (e.g. to "teach" chatbots answers to frequently asked questions or to identify unanswered inquiries).</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Information on Legal basis:</span></strong><span> We use the Chat Services on the basis of a consent if we first obtain the permission of the users to process their data by the Chat Services (this applies in cases where users are asked for consent, e.g. so that a chatbot regularly sends them messages). If we use Chat Services to answer user queries about our services or our company, this is done for contractual and pre-contractual communication. In addition, we use Chat Services based on our legitimate interests in optimizing the Chat Services, its operating efficiency and enhancing the positive user experience.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Withdrawal, objection and deletion:</span></strong><span> You can revoke a given consent at any time or contradict the processing of your data in the context of our hatbot use</span><span>.</span></p>

<h2><span>Video Conferences, Online Meetings, Webinars and Screen-Sharing</span></h2>
<p><span>We use platforms and applications of other providers (hereinafter referred to as "Conference Platforms") for the purpose of conducting video and audio conferences, webinars and other types of video and audio meetings (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Conference"). When using the Conference Platforms and their services, we comply with the legal requirements. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Data processed by Conference Platforms:</span></strong><span> In the course of participation in a Conference, the Data of the participants listed below are processed. The scope of the processing depends on the one hand, on which data is requested in the context of a specific Conference (e.g., provision of access data or clear names) and which optional information is provided by the participants. In addition to processing for the purpose of conducting the conference, participants' Data may also be processed by the Conference Platforms for security purposes or service optimization. The processed Date includes personal information (first name, last name), contact information (e-mail address, telephone number), access data (access codes or passwords), profile pictures, information on professional position/function, the IP address of the internet access, information on the participants' end devices, their operating system, the browser and its technical and linguistic settings, information on the content-related communication processes, i.e. entries in chats and audio and video data, as well as the use of other available functions (e.g. surveys). The content of communications is encrypted to the extent technically provided by the conference providers. If participants are registered as users with the Conference Platforms, then further data may be processed in accordance with the agreement with the respective Conference Provider.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Logging and recording:</span></strong><span> If text entries, participation results (e.g. from surveys) as well as video or audio recordings are recorded, this will be transparently communicated to the participants in advance and they will be asked - if necessary - for their consent.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Data protection measures of the participants:</span></strong><span> Please refer to the data privacy information of the Conference Platforms for details on the processing of your data and select the optimum security and data privacy settings for you within the framework of the settings of the conference platforms. Furthermore, please ensure data and privacy protection in the background of your recording for the duration of a Conference (e.g., by notifying roommates, locking doors, and using the background masking function, if technically possible). Links to the conference rooms as well as access data, should not be passed on to unauthorized third parties.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Notes on legal bases:</span></strong><span> Insofar as, in addition to the Conference Platforms, we also process users' data and ask users for their consent to use contents from the Conferences or certain functions (e.g. consent to a recording of Conferences), the legal basis of the processing is this consent.Â  Furthermore, our processing may be necessary for the fulfillment of our contractual obligations (e.g. in participant lists, in the case of reprocessing of Conference results, etc.). Otherwise, user data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests in efficient and secure communication with our communication partners.</span></p>

With the help of web analysis, we can e.g. recognize, at which time our online services or their functions or contents are most frequently used or requested for repeatedly, as well as which areas require optimization.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to web analysis, we can also use test procedures, e.g. to test and optimize different versions of our online services or their components.</span></p>
<p><span>For these purposes, so-called user profiles can be created and stored in a file (so-called "cookie") or similar procedures in which the relevant user information for the aforementioned analysis is stored. This information may include, for example, content viewed, web pages visited and elements and technical data used there, such as the browser used, computer system used and information on times of use. If users have consented to the collection of their location data, these may also be processed, depending on the provider.</span></p>
<p><span>The IP addresses of the users are also stored. However, we use any existing IP masking procedure (i.e. pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect the user. In general, within the framework of web analysis, A/B testing and optimization, no user data (such as e-mail addresses or names) is stored, but pseudonyms. This means that we, as well as the providers of the software used, do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles for the purposes of the respective processes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Information on legal basis:</span></strong><span> If we ask the users for their consent to the use of third-party providers, the legal basis of the processing is consent. Furthermore, the processing can be a component of our (pre)contractual services, provided that the use of the third party was agreed within this context. Otherwise, user data will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economic and recipient friendly services). In this context, we would also like to refer you to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.</span></p>

<h2><span>Profiles in Social Networks (Social Media)</span></h2>
<p><span>We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context in order to communicate with the users active there or to offer information about us.</span></p>
<p><span>We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This may entail risks for users, e.g. by making it more difficult to enforce users' rights.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, user data is usually processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can be created on the basis of user behavior and the associated interests of users. The user profiles can then be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks which are presumed to correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the user's computer, in which the user's usage behavior and interests are stored. Furthermore, data can be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective networks or will become members later on).</span></p>
<p><span>For a detailed description of the respective processing operations and the opt-out options, please refer to the respective data protection declarations and information provided by the providers of the respective networks.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, in the case of requests for information and the exercise of rights of data subjects, we point out that these can be most effectively pursued with the providers. Only the providers have access to the data of the users and can directly take appropriate measures and provide information. If you still need help, please do not hesitate to contact us.</span></p>

<h2><span>Terminology and Definitions</span></h2>
<p><span>This section provides an overview of the terms used in this privacy policy. Many of the terms are drawn from the law and defined mainly in Article 4 GDPR. The legal definitions are binding. The following explanations, on the other hand, are intended above all for the purpose of comprehension. The terms are sorted alphabetically.</span></p>
<p><span>Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Controller:</span></strong><span> "Controller" means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. </span></li>
<li><strong><span>IP Masking:</span></strong><span> IP masking is a method by which the last octet, i.e. the last two numbers of an IP address, are deleted so that the IP address alone can no longer be used to uniquely identify a person. IP masking is therefore a means of pseudonymizing processing methods, particularly in online marketing. </span></li>
<li><strong><span>Personal Data:</span></strong><span> "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. </span></li>
<li><strong><span>Processing:</span></strong><span> The term "processing" covers a wide range and practically every handling of data, be it collection, evaluation, storage, transmission or erasure. </span></li>
<li><strong><span>Profiles with user-related information:</span></strong><span> The processing of "profiles with user-related information", or "profiles" for short, includes any kind of automated processing of personal data that consists of using these personal data to analyze, evaluate or predict certain personal aspects relating to a natural person (depending on the type of profiling, this may include different information concerning demographics, behavior and interests, such as interaction with websites and their content, etc.) (e.g. interests in certain content or products, click behavior on a website or location). Cookies and web beacons are often used for profiling purposes. </span></li>
<li><strong><span>Web Analytics:</span></strong><span> Web Analytics serves the evaluation of visitor traffic of online services and can determine their behavior or interests in certain information, such as content of websites. With the help of web analytics, website owners, for example, can recognize at what time visitors visit their website and what content they are interested in. This allows them, for example, to optimize the content of the website to better meet the needs of their visitors. For purposes of web analytics, pseudonymous cookies and web beacons are frequently used in order to recognize returning visitors and thus obtain more precise analyses of the use of an online service. </span></li>
