<h1>Privacy &amp; Cookie Policies</h1>
<p class="page-lead">This privacy policy explains what information we may collect about you, how we may use it, and the steps we take to ensure that it is kept secure. We also explain your rights in respect of your personal data.</p>
<h2>How to contact us about your personal data or this privacy policy  </h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or about your personal data, please email us at <a href="mailto:info@sparkl-hardseltzer.com">info@sparkl-hardseltzer.com</a> or write to us at the following address:</p>

<h2>Information we collect and what we use it for </h2>
<p>All personal information that we collect about you will be recorded, used, and protected by us in accordance with applicable data protection legislation and this privacy policy. We may supplement the information that you provide with other information that we obtain from our dealings with you.<br/>In broad terms, we use your data for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>to administer and provide products and services you request or have expressed an interest in    </li>
<li>to enable us to administer any offers/promotions which you enter into</li>
<li>to communicate with you in the event that any products or services you have requested are unavailable</li>
<li>for fraud screening and prevention purposes</li>
<li>for record keeping purposes</li>
<li>to carry out market research so that we can improve the products and services we offer</li>
<li>to track your activity on our digital platforms</li>
<li>to create an individual profile for you so that we can understand and respect your preferences</li>
<li>to personalise and improve your experience on our digital platforms</li>
<li>to personalise and/or tailor any communications that we may send you</li>
<li>for profiling purposes to enable us to personalise and/or tailor any marketing communications that you may consent to receive from us</li>
</ul>
<p>When we provide you with products or services we may collect and store any personal information that you provide to us. We may, for example, keep a record of your name, address, email address, telephone number and Company name.</p>
<p>When you register to receive marketing communications from us, fill in one of our forms (whether online or offline) or otherwise expressly provide us with your personal information, we may collect and store any personal information that you provide to us and may use it to personalise and improve your experience on our digital platforms, provide products and services you request from us, and carry out profiling and market research.</p>
<p>When you interact with our digital platforms, we may also automatically collect the following information about your visit. This is primarily to help us better understand how our customers use our digital platforms to enable us create better content and more relevant communications:</p>
<ul>
<li>how you have reached our digital platform and the internet protocol (IP) address you have used </li>
<li>your browser type, versions and plug-ins, and your operating system</li>
<li>your journey through our digital platform, including which links you click on and any searches you made, how long you stayed on a page, and other page interaction information</li>
<li>what content you like or share</li>
<li>which pop up or push messages you might have seen and responded to</li>
<li>your subscription status</li>
<li>information collected in any forms you complete</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also infer your country of location from the IP address you have used to access our digital platforms and we may analyse which marketing activity led to your taking specific action on our digital platforms (e.g. downloading the catalogue).</p>
<h2>News, offers and opportunities from us </h2>
<p>We want you to be the first to know about new events and promotions but we need your consent to do so. You can unsubscribe by clicking the link at the bottom of the marketing communications or writing to us at the address above.</p>
<p>Please note, if you don’t choose to receive this information, we will be unable to keep you informed of new services, products, events or special offers that may interest you and our ability to inform you of other opportunities may be affected.</p>
<h2>Disclosure of your information</h2>
<p> In order to provide our products and services to you or to otherwise fulfil contractual arrangements that we have with you, we may need to appoint other organisations to carry out some of the data processing activities on our behalf. These may include, for example, payment processing organisations, delivery organisations, fraud prevention and screening and credit risk management companies, and mailing houses.</p>
<p>We may share your data with advertising networks and/or social media platforms for the purposes of selecting and serving relevant adverts to you via those networks/platforms, and to search engine and analytics providers.</p>
<p>We may share your data with third parties (a) if we are under a legal or regulatory duty to do so, (b) if it is necessary to do so to enforce our terms and conditions or other contractual rights, (c) to lawfully assist the police or security services with the prevention and detection of crime or terrorist activity, (d) where such disclosure is necessary to protect the safety or security of any persons, and/or (e) otherwise as permitted under applicable law.</p>
<p>Some of the organisations to which we may disclose your personal information are situated outside of the United Kingdom and European Union in countries which may not have laws that protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom. If we do transfer your personal information to other territories, we will take proper steps to ensure that your information is protected in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>In all instances where we disclose your information to third parties, we will ensure that your information is appropriately protected.</p>
<h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
<p>A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual.

<p>We use Google Analytics to monitor our website visitors, which identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs.

<p>Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.</p>
<p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p>
