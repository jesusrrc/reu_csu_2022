		          This page was last updated on

		        </p> <div class="line"></div> <p>
		          This privacy policy (
		          <span class="bold">"Privacy Policy"</span>) describes how Adbit.biz as a data controller, collect, use
		          and disclose personal data, and the steps we take to protect such personal data, provided by you or
		          collected by us either on the website
		          <a href="https://adbit.biz/">https://adbit.biz/</a>
		          (
		          <span class="bold">"Website"</span>) or when you use the
		          services or products that we provide or may provide in the future (
		          <span class="bold">"Services"</span>).
		        </p> <h3>1. Data we collect about you</h3> <p>
		          Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that
		          person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous
		          data). We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we
		          have grouped together follows:
		        </p> <ol type="a"><li><span class="bold">identity data</span>, such as, first name, last name and date of birth;
		          </li> <li><span class="bold">contact data</span>, such as, email address, mailing address and phone
		            number;
		          </li> <li><span class="bold">financial data</span>, such as, bank account, payment card details and
		            billing address;
		          </li> <li><span class="bold">transaction data</span>, such as, details about payments to and from you and
		            other details of the
		            Services you have purchased from us;
		          </li> <li><span class="bold">profile data</span>, such as, username, account number or password;
		          </li> <li><span class="bold">technical data</span>, such as, the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to
		            connect your computer to the
		            Internet, your login information (if applicable), browser type and version, time zone setting,
		            browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, information about your visit,
		            including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL), clickstream to, through and from our Website
		            (including date and time), page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain
		            pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouseovers), methods used to
		            browse away from the page and any information of yours related to contact our customer service
		            team;
		          </li> <li><span class="bold">usage data</span>, such as, information you viewed or searched for and
		            information about how you use
		            our Website and Services; and
		          </li> <li><span class="bold">marketing and communications data</span>, such as, your preferences in
		            receiving marketing from us and
		            our third parties and your communication responses.
		          </li></ol> <p>
		          We also collect, use and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data for any
		          purpose. Aggregated data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data
		          in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may
		          aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature.
		          However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or
		          indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in
		          accordance with this privacy notice.
		        </p> <h3>2. Methods of data collection</h3> <p>We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:</p> <ol type="a"><li><span class="bold">direct interactions.</span> You may give us your identity, contact and
		            financial data by filling in
		            forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email, skype and other messenger or otherwise.
		            This includes personal data you provide when you apply for our Services, create an account on
		            our Website, subscribe to our Service or publications, request marketing to be sent to you,
		            enter a competition, promotion or survey, or give us some feedback, including report a problem
		            with our Website;
		          </li> <li><span class="bold">automated technologies or interactions.</span> As you interact with our
		            Website, we may automatically
		            collect technical data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this
		            personal data by using cookies, server logs and other similar technologies. We may also receive
		            technical data about you if you visit other websites employing our cookies.
		          </li> <li><span class="bold">third parties or publicly available sources.</span> We may receive personal
		            data about you from public
		            domain, third parties (such as, analytics providers, advertising networks, search information
		            providers and providers of technical, payment and delivery services) or other websites we
		            operate or the other services we provide.
		          </li></ol> <p>
		          Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of an agreement we have with you
		          and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the agreement we
		          have or are trying to enter into with you, including to provide you with the Services. In this case,
		          we may have to cancel the Services you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at
		          the time.
		        </p> <h3>3. Use of your personal data</h3> <p>
		          We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your
		          personal data in the following circumstances:
		        </p> <ol type="a"><li>
		            where we need to perform the agreement, we are about to enter into or have entered into with
		            you;
		          </li> <li>
		            where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your
		            interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests;
		          </li> <li>where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li></ol> <p>
		          Legitimate interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to
		          enable us to provide you with the best Services and the best and most secure experience. We make
		          sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your
		          rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your
		          personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have
		          your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
		        </p> <p>
		          Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in
		          relation to sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message.
		          You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.
		        </p>
<p>
		          We may use your identity, contact, profile, technical and usage data to form a view on what we think
		          you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which Services and
		          offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). You may receive marketing communications
		          from us if you have requested information from us or purchased Services from us and, in each case,
		          you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
		        </p> <p>
		          You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on
		          any marketing message sent to you or by contact us at any time.
		        </p> <p>
		          We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably
		          consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original
		          purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is
		          compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
		        </p> <h3>4. Cookies and similar technologies</h3> <p>
		          Like most Internet sites, our Website may use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your user
		          experience and provide customization and useful features to our Website and Services. You can set
		          your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access
		          cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this Website may become
		          inaccessible or not function properly.
		        </p> <h3>5. Disclosure of your personal data</h3> <p>
		          Except as outlined in this Privacy Policy, your personal data will never be sold or disclosed with
		          other companies or organizations for commercial purposes or otherwise.
		        </p> <p>
		          We reserve the right at all times to disclose any personal data that we have collected when: (a)
		          permitted or required by law; or, (b) trying to protect against, prevent, investigate actual or
		          potential fraud, security issues, technical issues, unauthorized transactions or other violations;
		          or (c) trying to enforce the applicable terms of service or other agreements; or (d) protecting
		          against violations to the rights, property or safety of us, our users or the public as required or
		          permitted by applicable laws; or (e) you have given your consent to do so. Finally, we may transfer
		          personal data to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, partial or
		          total sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
		        </p> <p>
		          We may disclose your personal data to our contractors to process it for us, for the purposes of processing transactions, collecting
		          fees, identifying you, but also for improving your user experience, performing business support
		          functions or other related tasks, based on our instructions and in compliance with the Privacy
		          Policy and any other applicable confidentiality and security requirements. In addition, transfers to
		          our contractors are covered by the service agreements with such contractors.

 							<h3>6. Data security</h3> <p>
		          We adhere to the generally accepted industry standards to protect your personal data from being
		          accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. Only our
		          authorized employees, agents and contractors (who have agreed to keep personal data secure and
		          confidential) have access to the personal data on a need to know basis.
		        </p> <p>
		          We store and process data, including personal data, through third parties that we use to operate and manage the Services. When you access or use our
		          Websites or the Services, or otherwise provide personal data to us, you are consenting, on behalf of
		          you and your authorized agents, (and representing that you have the authority to provide such
		          consent) to the processing and transfer of personal data in and to the other countries which may
		          have different privacy laws from your or their country of residence. We will take all steps
		          reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with
		          this Privacy Policy.
		        </p> <p>
		          Any payment transactions will be encrypted. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a
		          password, which enables you to access certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping
		          this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
		        </p> <p>
		          You agree and acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the
		          submission of data over the Internet may not be secure. We strive to use acceptable means to protect
		          any personal data you share with us, however we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
		        </p> <h3>7. Data retention</h3> <p>
		          We will retain your personal data only for so long as it is required for the purposes for which it
		          was collected. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but only for so
		          long as is reasonably necessary for us to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits,
		          comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations (e.g. taxation purposes), resolve
		          disputes and enforce our agreements.
		        </p> <p>
		          To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
		          sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of
		          your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve
		          those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
		        </p> <p>
		          When your personal data is no longer required, we will destroy, delete or convert it into an
		          anonymous form.
		        </p> <h3>8. Third-party links</h3> <p>
		          The privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy apply to the Website and Services only. If you
		          link to other web sites (including sites that offer or use the Services or are promoted by us) or
		          use the services of other service providers, please review the privacy policies posted at those web
		          sites or by the relevant service providers.
		        </p> <h3>9. Age limitations</h3> <p>
		          We do not allow use of our Services and the Website by anyone younger than 18 years old. If you learn
		          that anyone younger than 18 has unlawfully provided us with personal data, please contact us and we
		          will take steps to delete such information.
		        </p> <h3>10. Your rights</h3> <p>
		          Under certain circumstances, you have following rights under data protection laws in relation to your
		          personal data:
		        </p> <ol type="a"><li>
		            right to request access to your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the
		            personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;
		          </li> <li>
		            right to request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to
		            have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify
		            the accuracy of the new data you provide to us;
		          </li> <li>
		            right to request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove
		            personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the
		            right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised
		            your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information
		            unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note,
		            however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific
		            legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;
		          </li> <li>
		            right to object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate
		            interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation
		            which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
		            fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your
		            personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
		            compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and
		            freedoms;
		          </li> <li>
		            right to request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
		            suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to
		            establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us
		            to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need
		            it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your
		            data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;
		          </li> <li>
		            right to request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide
		            to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
		            machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you
		            initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform an
		            agreement with you; and
		          </li> <li>
		            right to withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal
		            data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you
		            withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain
		            Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
		          </li></ol> <p>
		          You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
		          However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
		          excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
		        </p> <p>
		          We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your
		          right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
		          measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
		          We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up
		          our response.
		        </p> <p>
