Software is installed on the servers (hereinafter also referred to as the <strong>Software</strong>), which processes the data received, structures it and demonstrates the processing results through the personal account on <a href="/" style="text-decoration: underline">https://waviot.com</a> or on subdomains of this website (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>Website</strong>), as well as via mobile applications developed by the Operator for use on devices with Android or iOS operating systems, and published by the Operator in the online stores of the corresponding operating systems (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>Mobile Application</strong>), to you or the company that accepts the data on the Resources consumed, or payment for the Resources consumed (for example, a resource-supplying organization or an organization that manages your apartment building, condominium, cottage village, etc.), or data from other devices that transmit data to the server (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>Supplier</strong>).</p><p><br/>This allows you to control the amount of Resources you consume, eliminates the need to take readings from the meters yourself and report them to the Suppliers, or let representatives of the Suppliers to the apartment to do it for you, as well as receive data from other Devices that transmit data to our server.</p><br/><h4><a name="_Toc528021178"></a>Who you are</h4><p><br/><strong>1.5. </strong>You are an adult in the territory of the European Union who:</p><p><strong>(a)</strong> has purchased and installed the Device or lives in the premises where the Device is installed, and</p><p><strong>(b)</strong> intends to use the Device and Software and/or the Website or the Mobile Application for their functional purpose, and</p><p><strong>(c)</strong> has entered or will enter into an agreement with us on the use of the Software and/or the Website and the Mobile Application (hereinafter referred to as the <strong><a href="/Terms-and-Conditions/">Terms and Conditions</a></strong>), and/or</p><p><strong>(d)</strong> has entered into or will enter into an agreement with the Supplier (or a person similar to it), under the terms of which the Supplier transfers Resources to you (or provides/arranges such transfer in your interests), and you pay for them (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>Agreement</strong>), or you permanently or temporarily live in the premises, the owner/legal owner of which has entered into the Agreement.</p><br/><h4><a name="_Toc528021179"></a>What you are reading now</h4><p><br/><strong>1.6. Privacy Policy</strong> (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>Policy</strong>) is this document posted on the website page on the Internet: <a href="/privacy-policy/" style="text-decoration: underline">https://waviot.com/privacy-policy/,</a> designed to process your personal data (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>Data</strong>).</p><p><br/>In May 2018, the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect, replacing the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive. It ushers in a new era, unifying data protection rules across Europe, strengthening the rights of EU citizens, and placing new obligations on all organizations that offer goods and services online. We are committed to complying with the GDPR across all of the services that we provide. We have always worked hard to demonstrate that our services are secure and meet the standards of applicable data protection rules. We offer transparency to users through clear explanations of how we use personal data.</p><p>Below the policy describes what information about you we process, for what purposes, on what basis, and how. We will also explain what rights you have as a personal data subject and how to use them.</p><br/><h4><a name="_Toc528021180"></a>Restriction Concerning Children</h4><p><br/><strong>1.7.</strong> We do not provide services to children (i.e., persons under 18 years of age or other age at which a person is considered an adult in your country) and do not intend to process their personal data, as the Devices, Software, Website, and Mobile Application are not designed for use by children.</p><p><br/>However, we cannot reliably check your age when you visit the Website, register a personal account on the Site, or in the Mobile Application, therefore we assume that when you start using the Website or register your personal account on the Website or in the Mobile Application, you confirm that you are 18 years old (or the age after which a person in your country is considered an adult). If you are under 18 years old (or the age after which a person is considered an adult in your country), we ask you to leave our Website, not to use the Software and Mobile Application, not to fill out the registration forms on our Website and Mobile Application, not to mark the checkboxes in the fields “I accept the terms of the Policy” / “I agree to the processing of my personal data for [purpose]” / other similar fields and not to transfer your personal data to us in any other way, and not to express your consent to their processing.</p><br/><h2><strong>2.  Data about You that We Process and Their Sources</strong></h2><p id="2_1"><strong><br/>2.1.</strong> If you are a visitor to our Website, we process your cookies. </p><p><br/>For more information on how we collect and receive them see <a href="#7_0" style="text-decoration: underline"><u>Section 7</u></a> of the Policy.

However, this does not prevent their clarification and updating based on the data provided by you (see clause <a href="#6_24" style="text-decoration: underline">6.24</a> of the Policy).</p><p><strong>2.3.3.</strong> We can collect the information about counters, modems and other equipment, as well as readings obtained with them on our own, as a company that implements and operates such equipment, or do it via our subsidiaries, branches/representative offices or contractors (dealers, agents, representatives, etc.) if this is stipulated by the organizational features of the provision of services to you or the Supplier.</p><p><strong>2.4.</strong> In addition to the information specified in clause <a href="#2_2" style="text-decoration: underline"> 2.2 </a> of the Policy as we add to our Services the function of payment for the services provided by us or by the Supplier, we can also collect data on fees for our services or Resources you use. We are talking only about the cases when the use of such Resources is accounted for using the equipment and software provided and maintained by us.</p><p>The composition of such data on payments will include information on the number of payments, and the details of payments. Such data will be provided directly by you or the bank or payment service, which you use to make a payment.</p><p><strong>2.5.</strong> We do not process personal data that discloses racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs or philosophies, membership in a trade union, as well as genetic data, data relating to health, sexuality, or sexual orientation. If in spite of this, we receive such data from you, we will delete them.</p><p><strong>2.6.</strong> The recording of your voice, which may relate to the biometric data used for identification purposes, is processed by us only in the cases and for the purposes specified in clauses <a href="#6_24_2" style="text-decoration: underline"> 6.24.2</a> – <a href="#6_24_4" style="text-decoration: underline">6.24.4</a>,  <a href="#6_30" style="text-decoration: underline">6.30</a> of the Policy. In other cases, the biometric data received from you will not be used for identification purposes and will be deleted.</p> <br/><h2 id="3_0"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>What is the Basis and for What Purposes Do We Process Your Data?</strong></h2><br/><h4><a name="_Toc528021183"></a>Terms and Conditions</h4><p><br/><strong>3.1</strong>. We process the data necessary to register you in your personal account on the Website or via the Mobile Application, as it is necessary for the fulfillment of the Agreement, and your use of the functionality of the Software and the Website.</p><p><strong>3.2.</strong> If you do not provide us with such data, then:</p><p><strong>(a)</strong> we will not be able to execute an Agreement with you and will not be able to provide you with access to your personal account to use the functionality of the Software, the Website (in terms of those functional features that are available only through a personal account) and the Mobile Application;</p><p><strong>(b)</strong> this will not affect the validity of the Agreement (unless otherwise provided in the Agreement) and your right to consume Resources and your duty to pay for them.</p><br/><h4><a name="_Toc528021184"></a>Terms and Conditions and Agreement</h4><p><br/><strong>3.3.</strong> We process the data specified in clauses <a href="#2_1" style="text-decoration: underline">2.1</a> – <a href="#2_2_2" style="text-decoration: underline">2.2.2</a>, <a href="#2_2_5" style="text-decoration: underline">2.2.5</a> – <a href="#2_2_7" style="text-decoration: underline">2.2.7</a>, as it is required for the compliance with the Terms and Conditions and may be necessary for the fulfillment of the Agreement.</p><p><strong>3.4.</strong> By processing such Data, we will be able to save data on the Resources you use on the servers, structure it using software, then show you and the Supplier via your personal account on the Website or in the Mobile Application, and the Supplier will be able to use this Data to calculate the payment for the Resources consumed and the implementation of other rights and obligations provided for in the Agreement.</p><p><strong>3.5.</strong> If you do not provide us with such Data (as well as require you to delete it or limit its processing), then this will not affect the validity of the Agreement (unless otherwise provided therein). Therefore, your right to consume Resources, and your duty to pay for them will remain the same. However, this will reduce the functionality of the Site, Mobile Application, and software, since neither the Supplier nor you can use the software, the personal account on the Website and the Mobile Application to track the amount of resources you use – in this case, you and the Supplier will need to track this data differently in the manner prescribed by the Agreement. Please note that the agreement between you and the Supplier may also stipulate that, depending on the use of the Device and/or the software, different tariffs are applied to calculate the payment for the Resources consumed.</p><br/><h4><a name="_Toc528021188"></a>Advertising</h4><p><br/><strong>3.6.</strong> We process the Data specified in clause <a href="#2_3" style="text-decoration: underline">2.3</a> of the Policy also in order to send you advertisements of our goods and services via telephone, SMS messages, messages in mobile messengers, e-mail, via other communication channels.</p><p><strong>3.7.</strong> We process this Data based on your consent, which you provide to us when registering your account on the Website.
