                        together with certain additional information. That additional

                        will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be
                        provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a
                        reasonable fee.</p>

                        which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent

                        rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct
                        marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully

                        general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising
                        the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with
                        a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of
                        legal claims.</p>
<h3 id="7-6"><a href="#7-6">7.6</a></h3><p>In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing
                        of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy
                        of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we
                        no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but
                        you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of
                        legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the
                        verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on
                        this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we
                        will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the
                        establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection
                        of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of
                        important public interest.</p>
<h3 id="7-7"><a href="#7-7">7.7</a></h3><p>You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data
                        on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent
                        that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is
                        necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public
                        interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or
                        the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third
                        party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the
                        personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate
                        grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and
                        freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or
                        defence of legal claims.</p>

                        entering into a contract,</p>
<p>and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the
                        right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly
                        used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply
                        where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
<h3 id="7-9"><a href="#7-9">7.9</a></h3><p>If you consider that our processing of your personal information
                        infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a
                        complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection.
                        You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your
                        place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</p>
<h3 id="7-10"><a href="#7-10">7.10</a></h3><p>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your
                        personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that
                        consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of
                        processing before the withdrawal.</p>
<h3 id="7-11"><a href="#7-11">7.11</a></h3><p>You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal
