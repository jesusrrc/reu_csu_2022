If you contact us on one of our social media platforms, request guest service via social media, or otherwise direct us to communicate with you via social media, we may contact you via direct message or use other social media tools to interact with you. In these instances, your interactions with us are governed by this privacy policy as well as the privacy policy of the social media platform you use.<br/>
We may display targeted ads to you through social media platforms and other websites. These ads are sent to groups of people who share traits such as likely commercial interests and demographics.</p>
<p>Our online services may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook "Like" button, "Share to Twitter" button) to enable you to easily interact with certain social media websites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and share information with others.  When you visit our online services, the operators of the available social media plugins can place a cookie on your device enabling such operators to recognize individuals who have previously visited our online services.  If you are logged into these social media websites while visiting our online services, the social media plugins allow the relevant social media websites to receive information that you have visited our online services or other information.  The social media plugins also allow the applicable social media websites to share information about your activities on our online services with other users of the social media website.  For example, Facebook Social Plugins allow Facebook to show your "Likes" and comments on our online services to your Facebook friends.  Facebook Social Plugins also allow you to see your friends' Facebook activity on our online services.  We do not control any of the content from the social media plugins.</p>

<h3>FOR USERS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (EEA) AND OTHER SPECIFIC USERS.</h3>
<p><strong>To the extent the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or other law granting particular rights to data subjects applies to you, you have the following rights with regard to our processing of your personal data to the extent made available by the applicable law:</strong></p>
<h4>BUNDLAR as the Data Controller</h4>
<p>When you provide us with your information through our Sites or App or to use our Service, we serve as a data controller.  When we act as a data controller we determine how personal data will be utilized, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4>Our Legal Basis for Processing Your Personal Data</h4>
<p><strong>The following sets out our four (4) lawful bases under the GDPR to which we may process your personal data:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Contract With You:</strong> Our processing is necessary to perform our obligations under a contract with you or to perform steps requested by you prior to entering into a contract with you (e.g., to verify the information you have provided to us).</p>
<p><strong>Our Legitimate Interests:</strong> Where our processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of personal data. These legitimate interests include, but are not limited to, the protection and the security of our Service; to protect the health and safety of you or others; to establish, protect and defend our legal rights and interests; to prevent fraud and verify identity and authorization of clients; to understand and analyze usage trends; and to improve our products and Service.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Where our processing is required to comply with applicable law (for example, to maintain your payment transaction history for tax reporting purposes: e.g., in response to subpoenas, court orders and other lawful requests by regulators, courts and law enforcement agencies, or related to national security requests).</p>
<p><strong>Your Consent:</strong> Where you have given consent to process your personal data for one or more specified purposes, such as to provide our Service and other services requested by you.</p>
<h4>Data Subject Rights:</h4>
<h5>Access and Control of Your Information</h5>
<p>We enable you to have control over your personal data. To protect your privacy, before we give you access or let you access or update your personal data, we may we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information. We will try to update and allow you to access your personal information for free, but if it would require a disproportionate effort on our part, we may charge a fee. We will disclose the fee before we comply with your request. We may reject a request for a number of reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users, requires technical efforts that are disproportionate to the request, is repetitive, or is unlawful.</p>
<h5>Right to Rectification</h5>
<p>You have the right to correct your personal data if incorrect, which also includes the right to have incomplete personal data completed.</p>
<h5>Data Portability</h5>
<p>When we process your personal data by automated means that you have provided to us based on consent or through a contract, you have the right to get a copy of that data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have that transferred to you or to third party.</p>
<h5>Right to Restriction of Processing</h5>
<p>You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the pending period of time where we verify the accuracy of any personal data that you claim is inaccurate;</li>
<li>Where the processing of your personal data is unlawful but you oppose erasure and instead request that we restrict the use of your personal data;</li>
<li>If we no longer need your personal data but it is required for you to make or defend legal claims; or</li>
<li>During the pending period of time where we verify our legitimate interest to process your data when you object to such processing.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Right to Object</h5>
<p>You have the right to object to the processing of personal data under certain conditions. For example, you may object to any processing of your personal data where we have relied on legitimate interests as our legal basis, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interest. If you raise an objection, we will always respond to your request, but may not be required to honor it in all circumstances.</p>
<h5>Erasure of Personal Data</h5>
<p>You have the right to delete the personal data collected through our Services. There may be instances where we may not be able to delete your data or where we retain a copy of your data, for example, where we may need it to comply with a legal obligation or to protect the rights of others.</p>
<h5>How to Exercise Your Rights</h5>
<p>please contact us at <a href="https://bundlar.com/contact-us/">https://bundlar.com/contact-us/</a>.</p>
<h5>Right to Complain to Supervisory Authority in the European Union</h5>
<p>If you believe that we are processing your personal data in an incorrect or unlawful manner, please contact us at info@bundlar.com. For those located in the European Union, you also have a right to file a complaint with a Supervisory Authority in the EU.</p>
<h4>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h4>
<p>Personal data we collect from you will be stored and processed in the United States.  If you provide us with personal data, it will be transferred to, processed, and accessed in the United States.</p>
<p>YOU CONSENT TO ANY AND ALL INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE AND SUBMIT VIA THE SITE BEING SENT TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. We rely on derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR.  YOU ARE ALSO INFORMED THAT THE UNITED STATES PRESENTLY DOES NOT HAVE AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION AS DETERMINED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION’S ADEQUACY DECISION ON OCTOBER 6, 2015 (Case C-362/14) AND ARTICULATED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION’S GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION AND HAS NOT RECEIVED A SIMILAR DESIGNATION OF ADEQUACY BY ANY OTHER FOREIGN DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITY.  YOU AGREE TO THE TRANSFER OF YOUR DATA AND PERSONAL DATA TO THE UNITED STATES, HOWEVER, TO BE USED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
