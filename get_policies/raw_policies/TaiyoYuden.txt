<p>We are very delighted  that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a  particularly high priority for the management of the TAIYO YUDEN Group  (hereinafter referred to as “TAIYO YUDEN”). The use of the Internet pages of the TAIYO YUDEN  is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject  wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of  personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is  necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally  obtain consent from the data subject.</p>
<p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the TAIYO YUDEN. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>
<p>TAIYO YUDEN has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="inner">
<h2 class="titleType2">1. Definitions</h2>
<div class="solutionTxt">
<p>The data protection declaration of the TAIYO YUDEN is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

<div class="inner">
<h2 class="titleType3" style="margin-top:30px">f) Pseudonymisation</h2>
<div class="solutionTxt">
<p>Pseudonymisation is the  processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no  longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional  information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is  subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal  data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. </p>

<div class="inner">
<h2 class="titleType3" style="margin-top:30px">j) Third party</h2>

<h2 class="titleType2">4. Cookie</h2>
<div class="solutionTxt">
<p>The Internet pages of  the TAIYO YUDEN use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a  computer system via an Internet browser.</p>
<p>Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.</p>
<p>Through the use of cookies, the TAIYO YUDEN can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.</p>
<p>By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system.

<h2 class="titleType2">5. Collection of general data and information</h2>
<div class="solutionTxt">
<p>The website of the TAIYO  YUDEN collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or  automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are  stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and  versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the  website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called  referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the  Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet  service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and  information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information  technology systems.</p>
<p>When using these general  data and information, the TAIYO YUDEN does not draw any conclusions about the  data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of  our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its  advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology  systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities  with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a  cyber-attack. Therefore, the TAIYO YUDEN analyzes anonymously collected data  and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection  and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of  protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server  log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data  subject.</p>

<p>The TAIYO YUDEN shall no  longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can  demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the  interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment,  exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
<p>If the TAIYO YUDEN  processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall  have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning  him or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it  is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to the TAIYO  YUDEN to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the TAIYO YUDEN will no  longer process the personal data for these purposes.</p>
<p>In addition, the data  subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation,  to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her by the TAIYO  YUDEN for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical  purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is  necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public  interest.</p>

<h2 class="titleType2">10. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics <br/>
                (with anonymization function)</h2>
<div class="solutionTxt">
<p>On this website, the  controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the  anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web  analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior  of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data  about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which  sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was  viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in  order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.</p>
<p>The operator of the  Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain  View, CA 94043-1351, United States.</p>
<p>For the web analytics  through Google Analytics the controller uses the application "_gat.  _anonymizeIp". By means of this application the IP address of the Internet  connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when  accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another  Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p>
<p>The purpose of the  Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google  uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our  website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our  websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site  for us.</p>
<p>Google Analytics places  a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The  definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie,  Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one  of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the  controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the  Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will  automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the  purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google.  During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains  knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject,  which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and  clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.</p>
<p>The cookie is used to  store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which  the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data  subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including  the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be  transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are  stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these  personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties. </p>
<p>The data subject may, as  stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by  means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus  permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet  browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the  information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already  in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or  other software programs.</p>
<p>In addition, the data subject  has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by  Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the  processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this  purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link  https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it. This browser add-on  tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information  about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics.  The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google.  If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted,  formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser  add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by  the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of  competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or  reactivation of the browser add-ons.</p>
<p>Further information and  the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under  https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and under http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html.

<p>On this website, the  controller has integrated components of XING. XING is an Internet-based social  network that enables users to connect with existing business contacts and to  create new business contacts. The individual users can create a personal  profile of themselves at XING. Companies may, e.g. create company profiles or  publish jobs on XING.</p>
<p>The operating company of  XING is XING SE, Dammtorstraße 30, 20354 Hamburg, Germany.</p>
<p>With each call-up to one  of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the  controller and on which a XING component (XING plug-in) was integrated, the  Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is  automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding XING  component of XING. Further information about the XING plug-in the may be  accessed under https://dev.xing.com/plugins. During the course of this  technical procedure, XING gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our  website was visited by the data subject.</p>
<p>If the data subject is  logged in at the same time on XING, XING detects with every call-up to our  website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our  Internet site—which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the  data subject. This information is collected through the XING component and  associated with the respective XING account of the data subject. If the data  subject clicks on the XING button integrated on our Internet site, e.g. the  "Share"-button, then XING assigns this information to the personal  XING user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.</p>
<p>XING receives information  via the XING component that the data subject has visited our website, provided  that the data subject is logged in at XING at the time of the call to our  website. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the XING  component or not. If such a transmission of information to XING is not  desirable for the data subject, then he or she can prevent this by logging off  from their XING account before a call-up to our website is made.</p>
<p>The data protection  provisions published by XING, which is available under  https://www.xing.com/privacy, provide information on the collection, processing  and use of personal data by XING. In addition, XING has published privacy  notices for the XING share button under  https://www.xing.com/app/share?op=data_protection.</p>

<h2 class="titleType2">12. Legal basis for the processing</h2>
<div class="solutionTxt">
<p>TAIYO YUDEN is an  international company with worldwide business processes, management structures  and technical systems. Therefore, we may use your personal information for the  above purposes and in accordance with this privacy policy within our company  and transmit it to other locations in other countries. Our privacy policy and  our privacy practices are designed to provide a consistent level of protection  for personal information worldwide. This means that TAIYO YUDEN will handle  your personal information in the manner described here, even in countries where  your personal data may be subject to less stringent privacy policies.</p>
<p>Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR  serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent  for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is  necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party,  as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the  supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on  Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which  are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the  case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject  to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as  for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1)  lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to  protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.  This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company  and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have  to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing  would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could  be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing  operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if  processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by  our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by  the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which  require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are  particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the  European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if  the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR). </p>

<h2 class="titleType2">13. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party</h2>

<div class="inner">
<h2 class="titleType2">14. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h2>
<div class="solutionTxt">
<p>The criteria used to  determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory  retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is  routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of  the contract or the initiation of a contract.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="titleType2">15. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data </h2>
<div class="solutionTxt">
<p>We clarify that the  provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or  can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the  contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that  the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be  processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with  personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The  non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract  with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided  by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee  clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is  required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract,  whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the  consequences of non-provision of the personal data. </p>
