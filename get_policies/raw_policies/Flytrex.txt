(“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>Flytrex</strong>”) provides an on-demand delivery service (the "<strong>Service</strong>"). The Service may be provided via the Flytrex mobile application (the "<strong>Application</strong>").<br/>‍<br/>Flytrex respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the use of your information is important to us. This privacy policy details how we collect, use and store information and data that we receive, including through the Application or through the Flytrex Internet website or various social media accounts (collectively, the "<strong>Sites</strong>"). If you have any comments or questions about our privacy policies, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@flytrex.com?subject=Comments%20or%20questions%20about%20privacy%20policy" target="_blank"><span>privacy@flytrex.com</span></a>.<br/><br/>As used in this privacy policy, “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.<br/>‍<br/><span><strong>Information We Collect<br/></strong></span><strong>‍</strong>We collect certain information when you create an account or otherwise use the Application. Such information includes your name, address, phone number, email address and your order information, as well as the location of any deliveries that we make. You may also log into the Application through a third party authentication framework used by us, which may for example include your Facebook or Google account. In such event, we receive personal information about you which is provided by such social network, which includes your name and your photograph or likeness. Please check the policies of the applicable authentication framework in order to understand what information we receive.<br/>‍<br/>When you contact us from the Site, we collect such information as your name, email address and the content of your request. When you contact us from the Site in order to apply for a job offering, we collect all the information included in your CV, as well as your name and email address.<br/>‍<br/>The Application and Site will also record certain information automatically, such as your IP address, and technical information regarding mobile device or computer, operating system and browser. The Application will also record technical information regarding its operations and performance.<em> </em>In addition, we collect any information you provide when you contact us for any reason such as, for example, if you provide us with any information regarding logs, errors or bugs in the Application. You are not required by law to provide us with any of the information described herein, but by using the Application or the Site you agree to provide us with such information.<br/>‍<br/><span><strong>How We Use Information<br/></strong></span><strong>‍</strong>We will not share your personal information with third parties without your explicit permission, except when required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order or as otherwise expressly set forth in the policy. We may use personal and other information internally. For example, we may use personal and other information to improve our technology and algorithms, to help diagnose problems with our servers, or to make the Site or Application more useful for you and for our other customers.<br/>‍<br/>We use and share personal information as needed in order to fulfill your order. We may share this Personal Information with our third party subcontractors that we use to assist in fulfilling your order. For example, we use third party payment processors to assist in processing your payment details. In addition, as below, we may share such personal information with the retailer with which your order was placed. As further described below, use of your personal information by such retailer shall be subject to the privacy policy of the retailer.<br/>‍<br/>We are subject to regulatory requirements that require us to retain certain flight data. Such requirements may also require us to share flight data with the aviation regulators in your jurisdiction, such as the Federal Aviation Administration, or with third party entities that provide unmanned traffic management services on their behalf in order to coordinate the drone flights.<br/>‍<br/>By analyzing all information we receive, we may compile statistical information across a variety of users (“<strong>Statistical Information</strong>”). Statistical Information helps understand trends and customer needs so that new services can be considered and so the Application, Site and associated services can be tailored to customer desires. We may share Statistical Information with our partners, pursuant to commercial terms that we determine in our sole discretion.<br/>‍<br/>We may also use analytics tools to collect Internet traffic data and other information about the use of the Application and Site. Such third party tools may collect information such as how often users visit the Site or Application, and what other sites you used prior to coming to the Site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site and/or Application, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site, Application and services.<br/>‍<br/>Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site or Application is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use located at <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html</a> and the Google Privacy Policy located at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.<br/>‍<br/>In addition, we may share your Personal Information with:<br/>‍<span><br/></span>        Members of our corporate family, or third party vendors or service providers, such as third party drone operators performing deliveries on our behalf. We may also authorize third party vendors or service providers to collect information on our behalf.  We will require members of our corporate family and third party vendors to follow practices that protect your privacy rights on a level at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy.<br/><br/>        Business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services may be offered through the Application or the Site.

Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third party business partners. If you wish to no longer allow that third party to use your information, please contact that third party directly.<br/>‍<br/>        Referring websites.  If you were referred to this website from another site (for example, through a link), we may share some information about you with that referring website. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website that referred you here.

This unique identifier will not contain any of your Personal Information.<br/>‍<br/><span>How we Protect Information<br/></span><strong>‍</strong>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
