<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3>Our Commitment to Privacy</h3>
<div>
        Ellenex is committed to providing quality services to you and this
        policy outlines our ongoing obligations to you in respect of how we
        manage your Personal Information.
        <br/>
        Your privacy is very important to us. We have adopted the Australian
        Privacy Principles (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the
        Privacy Act). The NPPs govern the way in which we collect, use,
        disclose, store, secure and dispose of your Personal Information.
        <br/>
        This privacy policy explains what type of information we collect and
        what we do with that information to allow you to make choices about the
        way your information is collected and used. This privacy policy may
        change from time to time, so please check it often.

<h3>
        What is Personal Information and why do we collect it?
      </h3>
<div>
        Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies an
        individual. Examples of Personal Information we collect include: names,
        email addresses, phone and facsimile numbers.
        <br/>
        We collect your Personal Information for the primary purpose of
        providing our services to you and providing information to our clients.
        We may also use your Personal Information for secondary purposes closely
        related to the primary purpose, in circumstances where you would
        reasonably expect such use or disclosure. You may unsubscribe at any
        time by contacting us in writing.
        <br/>
        Information collected online can generally be categorized as anonymous
        or personally identifiable. Anonymous information is information that
        cannot be connected to the identity of a specific individual.
        Personally, identifiable information is information that specifically
        identifies a particular user, such as name or phone number.

        Your Personal Information is stored in a manner that reasonably protects

        disclosure.
        <br/>
        We collect personally identifiable information only for providing the
        services you request, generating statistical studies, conducting
        marketing research, improving products and services, sending you
        surveys, and notifying you of new products and any other changes to our

        allow us to access, store, and use that information for those purposes.
        We will not sell or give any personally identifiable information to any
        third parties.
        <br/>
        When your Personal Information is no longer needed for the purpose for
        which it was obtained, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or
        permanently de-identify your Personal Information. However, most of the
        Personal Information is or will be stored in client files which will be
        kept by us for a minimum of 7 years.

        <br/>
        In order to protect your Personal Information, we may require
        identification from you before releasing the requested information.

        as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the
        personally identifiable information provided by our users. We do not,
        however, guarantee that unauthorized, inadvertent disclosure will never
        occur.

        business. Accordingly, if we merge with another entity or if we sell our
        assets to another entity, our customer lists and information, including
        personally identifiable information you have provided us, would be
