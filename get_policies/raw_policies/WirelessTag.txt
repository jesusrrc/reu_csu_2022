<h3>
								Information we collect and how we use it
							</h3>
<p>
								We may collect the following types of information:
							</p>
<p>
<b>Email addresses you provide</b> – When you sign up for a mytaglist.com account,
								we ask you for your email address to 1) identify your account, and 2) to allow you
								to retrieve lost password. When you configure Tag Manager to send out notification
								emails, we ask you for the email address to deliver such notification email messages.
								We do not verify any email address you supply is valid or not; this allows you to use any text that resembles an email address to identify your account and to use our products and services.
								<br/><br/>
<b>Temperature, humidity, moisture and/or motion data collected by Wireless Sensor Tags you use</b>
								– In order to generate your personal temperature graphs or event logs for your account, we store these information until you delete
								them from the app user interface.
								We associate these information with your account. Because we only collect email address (which does not have to be a valid one)
								for each account, the source and exact location of these information will not be individually identifiable.  <br/><br/>
<b>Name, comment and/or picture for each sensor that you assign or provide</b> – It is completely optional for you to assign name, comment or picture for each sensor tag to help you tell one sensor tag from another.
								You can permanently delete or alter the these information any time by using the mobile app or web browser interface.
								<br/><br/>

								or other client, our servers automatically record certain information. They include
								information such as your web request, your interaction with a service, Internet
								Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request
								and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.
								We use this information to improve server performance and our other services.<br/><br/>

								Gadgets, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries,
								respond to your requests and improve our services. We may use your email address
								to communicate with you about our services.<br/><br/>

								collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.We processes personal
								information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries.
								In some cases, we process personal information outside your own country.<br/>
</p>

								Choices
							</h3>
<p>
								We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily
								submit such information to us. We will collect personal identification information
								from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. You can always refuse
								to supply personally identification information, In such case, certain services
								such as accessing your tag list from a web browser, or retrieving lost password
								through email may not be available. Most browsers are initially set up to accept
								cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when
								a cookie is being sent. However, some features and services may not function properly
								if your cookies are disabled.<br/>
</p>
<h3>
								How we protect your information
							</h3>
<p>
								We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security
								measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction
								of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data
								stored on our Site. We restrict access to personal information to our employees,
								contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it
								on our behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may
								be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they
								fail to meet these obligations.<br/>

								Information sharing
							</h3>
<p>

								We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal
								identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners,
								trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. If Cao Gadgets

								or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained
								by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify
								themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before
								processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably
								repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize
								the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests
								concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise
								required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform
								this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate
								effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information,
								residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active
								servers and may remain in our backup systems.<br/>
