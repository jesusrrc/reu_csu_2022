(“All Telecom Korea”) and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively “All Telecom Korea Companies”, and each individually “All Telecom Korea Company”) provide a broad range of telecommunications services to customers, including Internet access, and local and long distance services in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The All Telecom Korea Companies (as defined in Part IV below) are committed to maintaining the privacy, confidentiality, security and accuracy of customer and employee personal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1996, the Canadian Standards Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information, CAN/CSA-Q830-96 (the “CSA Code”), was published as a National Standard of Canada.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The All Telecom Korea Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is a formal statement of principles and guidelines concerning the minimum requirements for the protection of personal information provided by the All Telecom Korea Companies to their customers and employees. The objective of the Privacy Policy is responsible and transparent practices in the management of personal information, in accordance with the CSA Code and federal legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The All Telecom Korea  Companies will continue to review the Privacy Policy to make sure it is relevant and remains current with changing technologies and laws and the evolving needs of the All Telecom Korea Companies, our customers and employees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The All Telecom Korea Companies may also collect, use or disclose personal information without knowledge or consent if seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information such as in the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law.</span></p>

Purposes shall be stated in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the customer or employee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.3    Generally, the All Telecom Korea Companies shall seek consent to use and disclose personal information at the same time they collect the information.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.6    In general, the use of products and services by a customer, or the acceptance of employment or benefits by an employee, constitutes implied consent for the All Telecom Korea Companies to collect, use and disclose personal information for all identified purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.7    A customer or employee may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Principle 5 – Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention of Personal Information</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The All Telecom Korea Companies shall not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by law.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9.2    In certain situations, the All Telecom Korea Companies may not be able to provide access to all of the personal information that they hold about a customer or employee. For example, the All Telecom Korea Companies may not provide access to information if doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party or could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual. Also, the All Telecom Korea Companies may not provide access to information if disclosure would reveal confidential commercial information, if the information is protected by solicitor-client privilege, if the information was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process, or if the information was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law. If access to personal information cannot be provided, the All Telecom Korea Companies shall provide the reasons for denying access upon request.</span></p>

<p><b>VI.       The Privacy Policy in Practice – Questions and Answers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.      Why does All Telecom Korea have a Privacy Policy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.      Our Privacy Policy ensures that our commitment to your privacy is upheld. The Privacy Policy reflects our most recent policies setting out your rights and our obligations respecting the treatment of your personal information by the All Telecom Korea Companies. The Privacy Policy complies with the requirements of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act as well as the Canadian Standards Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information. (A summary of the principles underlying the Privacy Policy is included in Section II above.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.      How do the All Telecom Korea Companies ensure that their employees and agents adhere to the Privacy Policy when handling personal information?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.      Employees and agents acting on our behalf are required to adhere to the Privacy Policy. All of our employees who have access to personal information are trained in the handling of such information, and new employees receive training on privacy as a fundamental part of their initial company training. All of our employees must review and commit to the Privacy Policy annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.      What is personal information?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.      Personal information is information about an identifiable individual. This includes information about your product and service subscriptions and usage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.      Why does All Telecom Korea collect information?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.      Collecting information helps us serve you better. The All Telecom Korea Companies collect personal information only for the following purposes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to establish and maintain responsible commercial relations with you and provide you with ongoing service;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to understand your needs and eligibility for products &amp; services;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to recommend particular products &amp; services to meet your needs;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to develop, enhance, market or provide products and services;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to manage and develop the business and operations of the All Telecom Korea Companies, including personnel and employment matters; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to meet legal and regulatory requirements.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your personal information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.      Where does All Telecom Korea store personal information that it has collected?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.      Our general policy is to store personal information within Canada. However, some personal information stored in third-party systems is accessed or stored outside of Canada, particularly where the third-party provider is not Canadian.  Where this occurs, it is our policy to inform you wherever possible, generally at the point at which the information is collected or used.  Third-party systems for which we currently provide such notification include Zoho. All of these use servers located in the United States.  Some also may use servers located in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third party systems, both abroad and also in Canada, are subject to the laws of the countries in which they are located or headquartered.  In the United States, this means that your information may be subject to U.S. disclosure obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.      Why do we share information among the All Telecom Korea Companies?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.      Sharing information among the All Telecom Korea Companies helps us understand your full needs and serve you better. Such sharing helps us identify your information, communication, and entertainment needs, and provide you with relevant information, advice, products and services. In some cases, certain products and service are available only from some of the All Telecom Korea Companies and not others. Therefore, in such cases, the sharing of information may also be necessary for the provision of certain bundles of products and/or services. Should you identify incorrect or outdated information to us, we will make the necessary changes promptly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.      Can I withdraw my consent to the sharing of information among the All Telecom Korea Companies when such sharing is for the purpose of promoting products and services?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.      You may decide that you prefer us not to share your personal information among the All Telecom Korea Companies to promote products and services. If this is the case, you may advise us by calling us at 1.866.622.4545.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.      Do you share personal information with any other parties, and if so, who?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.      We understand “personal information” broadly: customer name &amp; address, payment information, and account activity like volume of data transferred, to be sure; but also identifiers like IP addresses, MAC addresses, and anything else that, when added to what many third parties already know, could identify you personally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not share personal information with anyone outside the All Telecom Korea Companies where we can avoid it.  However, there are contractual, court-ordered, and emergency circumstances when we have to do so. When we do, we limit it to the information required in the circumstances, inform you where allowed, provide it only for the purpose stipulated, and make it subject to strict terms of confidentiality. When a court orders us to provide personal information, we tell you about it unless we have been ordered by law not to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third parties to whom we provide personal information, and are held to the above standards, include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service providers acting on behalf of a All Telecom Korea  Company.  This, notably, includes wholesale network access providers.  But it may also include other service providers: those hired to perform installation or maintenance on our behalf; a collection agency, for the express purpose of collecting past due bills; an emergency services provider (9-1-1);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other communications service providers, to offer efficient and effective communications services.  For instance, we participate in CRTC-mandated number portability and other activities which require providing clearly-identified information elements to your new provider.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where required by law, such as by court order or warrant; in exigent circumstances, where the law would have required it were there time; and for internal security matters.  These have almost always been law enforcement or emergency services, but from time to time, third parties have gone to court to seek pre-trial “Norwich Orders” compelling us to provide information in our possession.  Where they have, we have always insisted on providing our end-users with as much notice as is feasible in order to give them the opportunity to oppose such motions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third parties to whom we may have to provide personal information include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An agent acting on behalf any one of the All Telecom Korea Companies, such as an entity hired to perform installation or maintenance on our behalf;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another communications service provider, in order to offer efficient and effective communications services (e.g., to provide dialup Internet services while outside our coverage area for Internet services);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A collection agency, for the express purpose of the collection of past due bills;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement agencies, in emergencies, for internal security matters, or where required by court order or search warrant; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency services, in emergency situations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.      How do the All Telecom Korea Companies safeguard personal information?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.      We take all of the necessary precautions to ensure the safeguarding of your information, whether it is stored electronically or in paper format. In all cases, information is retained in secure facilities, protected from unauthorized access and kept only as long as is reasonably required. For example, our electronic files are backed up for redundancy, password protected and accessible only by authorized employees, on a need-to-know basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.      How long does All Telecom Korea store IP address log information?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.     Log information remains within the database system for 30 days after a session is terminated. We have no purpose for that information beyond that point, so it is automatically deleted, on a rolling basis. However, end-users have the ability to maintain a single session indefinitely through persistent use.  IP address log information is only deleted 30 days after the session has ended, whether through inactivity, the most common reason a session ends; a modem power-cycle; or some other external event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In isolated cases, we are required to extract certain information from that system in order to preserve it for longer than 30 days. Occasionally we are required to do this by a court order in a criminal matter, but the most common reason for a mandated longer preservation period is to comply with the Copyright Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since January 2, 2015, we have been </span><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/FullText.html#h-56"><span style="font-weight: 400;">required</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to forward notices of claimed copyright infringement to the account information that matches the IP address and timestamp indicated on the notice. When we do so, we are also required to retain that IP-address-to-account correlation information, and the associated accountholder’s identity, for six months. If the copyright owner who sent the notice commences court proceedings, we may be required to retain it for more than six months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.      What are “cookies” and do the All Telecom Korea Companies use them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.      During user interaction with one of our Internet sites, we may use a browser feature called a “cookie” to collect information anonymously and track user patterns on our web sites. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that identifies your browser – but not you – to our computer systems each time you visit one of our sites that uses cookies.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you specifically advise us, we will not know who you are, even though we may assign the browser associated with your computer a cookie. We cannot use cookies, by themselves, to disclose the individual identity of any site user, and we do not combine information gathered by a cookie with personally identifiable information like your name, telephone number, or email address without your consent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most major websites use cookies and most major browsers are set up to accept them.

You do not need cookies to visit the web sites of All Telecom Korea Companies. However, if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to use some of the features available on our sites, such as personalization features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.      Do you route personal information through another country, even where it is destined to a Canadian endpoint?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.         Yes. We route domestically wherever possible, are very active in major Canadian Internet exchange point communities like TORIX and QIX (where we peer), peer wherever feasible, and do what we can to keep data domestic.  In fact, we are very active on this front.  At the same time, the United States has always been the major Internet hub: part of delivering an excellent experience to our end-users is ensuring excellent connectivity to key U.S. Internet traffic exchanges, and we maintain active routes between our Canadian network and California (the San Francisco and Los Angeles regions), New York, and Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.      What do I do if I have further questions or concerns?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.      If you have further questions or concerns about your privacy, you can contact us at 1.866.622.4545, or by sending an email containing such a request to info@alltelecomkorea.com. Our customer service representatives will assist you in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q.      Is there a further complaint procedure?</span></p>
