A third country is considered unsafe if the EU Commission has not issued an adequacy decision for this country pursuant to Article 45 (1) of the GDPR confirming that adequate protection for personal data exists in the country.</p><p>The USA is a so-called unsafe third country. This means that the USA does not offer a level of data protection comparable to that in the EU. The following risks exist when personal data is transferred to the USA.
