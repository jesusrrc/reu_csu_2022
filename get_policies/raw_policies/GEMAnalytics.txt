We may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. </p><p>This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of Personal Information about our customers’ users and other third parties that we receive from our customers and others. If you provide us with any Personal Information about another person, you represent and warrant that you have that person’s consent to do so and that such person has given explicit consent for us to collect, process, use and store their Personal Information for the purpose for which you have sent it to us and as set forth in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. </p><p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 16. If we learn that we have collected the information from a minor under the age of 16, we will delete that information as soon as possible. </p><p>For the purposes of any applicable data protection law ("Data Protection Law"), Gem Software, Inc.

Gem accesses and stores a limited subset of data from your account, including name and email address, to provide you with our Services. </p><p>For users authenticating via Google accounts; Gem Software’s use of information received, and Gem Software's transfer of information to any other app, from Google APIs will adhere to Google's Limited Use Requirements. </p><p>We receive and store any information that you provide to us during your use the Services. For example, through your account settings, sending emails and InMail, creating lists of contacts, inputting contact information, requests for support through customer care, and otherwise using the Services, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, location, phone number, payment information, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Google Mail or other third party sites).

Cookies are web identifiers we, and other services, transfer to your browser to allow us to recognize your browser when you visit our site. We also use data from your cookies to track when and how often pages on our site and part of our Services are visited. We use this data to customize your experience with our Services and to generally improve our website and Services. You may be able to change the preferences within your browser to limit your acceptance of cookies, but this will prevent you from using some or all features of our Services. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services. </p><p>Through cookies we place on your browser or device or through our browser extension, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.  </p><p>Our advertising partners or customers may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on or through the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device. </p><p>We also automatically receive information about communications sent and received using our Services. </p><p>Our customers and other third parties may also provide us with Personal Information about our customers’ contacts and others. For example, we may receive Personal Information and other information from our customers, email senders, databases with information relevant to profile URLs and emails submitted to our Services, and other third parties. This information may include, without limitation, contact and other information. </p><p>In connection with your use of the Services, we may also collect information created or provided by you, or that we otherwise receive, in connection therewith. For example, if your contacts send messages to you, we may collect and maintain the message data, which may include Personal Information. </p><h3>Information Collected Automatically </h3><p>We use third party analytics services in order to better understand how our users are engaging with our Services. When a user browses our website or uses the Services, these services may collect the user’s IP address, browser type, and approximate location (based on the IP address). They may also set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In order to refine our understanding of user engagement, we provide these services with a user’s email address (which we collected as part of the user’s account registration process). </p><p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, data storage services, marketing services, and payment processing companies to receive and process your financial transactions for us. In addition, by submitting information on our Site or otherwise using our Services, Personal Information that we process and collect may be transferred between companies, business units and employees affiliated with us and you hereby explicitly consent to trans-border transmission of such information. </p><p>We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer and other user information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, merged, reorganized, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control or similar event, you acknowledge and explicitly consent that Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. </p><p>We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with law, legal obligations, regulations, law enforcement, governmental and other legal requests, or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; address fraud, security or technical issues; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Gem Software, our employees, our users, or others. </p><h2>How do we store and protect your information? </h2><p>We care about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through our Service.

Your information will be stored and processed in the United States or other countries where we decide to maintain datacenter facilities in the future. Regardless of what country you reside or supply information from, you authorize us to use, process and store your information in the United States and any other country where we operate, which may have different rules, regulations and protections regarding privacy than those in your jurisdiction.</p><p>When transferring data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, Gem Software relies upon a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts with our users. Gem Software complies with the Standard Contractual Clauses as laid out in the GDPR regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland to the United States.</p><p>Gem Software is responsible for the processing of Personal Information it receives and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.
