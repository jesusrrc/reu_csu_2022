By submitting Personal Data through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p></li><li><p>A Note About Children.

If a child under 18 submits Personal Data to Company and we learn that the Personal Data is the information of a child under 18, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.

In addition, your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p></li><li><p>Purposes of Processing.</p></li></ol><p>What is Personal Data?</p><p>We collect information about you in a range of forms, including Personal Data. As used in this Policy, “Personal Data” means any information which, either alone or in combination with other information we hold about you, identifies you as an individual, including, for example, your name, postal address, email address, geolocation and telephone number.</p><p>Why do we need your Personal Data?</p><p>We will only process your Personal Data in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws. We need certain Personal Data in order to provide you with access to the Site/Services. If you created a profile/registered with us, you will have been asked to click a button indicating your agreement to provide this data in order to access and use our Services or view our content. This consent provides us with the legal basis we require under applicable law to process your Personal Data. You maintain the right to withdraw such consent at any time. If you do not agree to our use of your Personal Data in line with this policy, please do not use our Site/Services.</p><p>Types of Data We Collect. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below. When we use the term “Anonymous Data,” we are referring to data and information that does not permit you to be identified or identifiable, either alone or when combined with any other information available to a third party. We may create Anonymous Data from the Personal Data that we receive about you and other individuals whose Personal Data we collect. Anonymous Data might include analytics information and information collected by us using cookies (“Cookies”). We make Personal Data into Anonymous Data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze usage patterns in order to make improvements to our Site/Services.</p><p>(a) Information You Provide to Us.</p><ul><li><p>We may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, email and mailing addresses, and password when you create an account to log in to our Services (“Account”).</p></li><li><p>If you use our Services on your mobile device, including through our Application, we may collect your phone number and the unique device id number.</p></li><li><p>If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location), we may store and use that information to provide you with location-based information and location-based services. If you want to deactivate this feature, you can either reinstall the Application or deactivate GPS on your mobile device.</p></li><li><p>When connecting to our Services via a service provider that uniquely identifies your mobile device, we may receive this identification and use it to offer extended services and/or functionality.</p></li><li><p>When you order services on our Site, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, and billing information.</p></li><li><p>We retain information on your behalf, such as files that you store using your Account.</p></li><li><p>If you provide us feedback or contact us via email, we will collect your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply.</p></li><li><p>We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number, and other requested information if you contact us via email regarding support for the Services.</p></li><li><p>We may also collect other forms of Personal Data, such as at other points in our Site that state that Personal Data is being collected.</p></li></ul><p>(b) Information Collected via Technology.</p><ul><li><p>Information Collected by Our Servers. To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.</p></li><li><p>Log Files. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site or the Services again, it will recognize you, and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.</p></li><li><p>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals. We do not currently respond to “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that might enable consumers to opt out of tracking on our Site.</p></li><li><p>Mobile Services. We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded our Application(s). This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your geographic location, how you use the Application(s), and information about the type of device you use. In addition, in the event our Application(s) crash on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model, software version, and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Application(s). This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.</p></li><li><p>Location Information. If you have enabled location services on your phone, we collect your location information to enable the use of your phone as a location tracking device. If you do not want this information collected by us, you can disable location services on your phone.</p></li></ul><p>(c) Information Collected from Others.
