<p>6. We have prepared emergency plan for Personal Information security incidents, and will arrange emergency response trainings and emergency drills for our employees on a regular basis, so as to familiarize them with job responsibilities and emergency response strategies and procedures. In case of any security incident such as Personal Information leakage, we will activate the emergency plan to prevent its escalation, and inform you via push notification, announcement or in other forms.</p>
<p>7.<span class="point">Please properly keep your Blued ID</span>. During your use of certain Blued services or applications, or when you publish posts in other forums, chat rooms or social networks, the Personal Information and contents you share will be accessible to, and may be read, collected or used by, other users.

If you are notified that your account has been suspended and you believe this is an error, please email a Customer Support representative at kfts@blued.com to seek an appeal.</p>
<p>9. We have the right to refuse to deal with any request if it is meaningless/importuning or extremely unrealistic, or will impair others’ privacy rights, or where access to information can be denied pursuant to local laws.</p>
<p>10. Blued takes the privacy and security of your personal data very seriously. Even so, transferring data on the Internet or storing data electronically is not completely secure. If, as required by law, we need to notify you about any unauthorized access to your personal data, then we may send you a notice in electronic or written form in accordance with applicable law.</p>
