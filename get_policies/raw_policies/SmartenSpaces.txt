FEATURES AND SERVICES**\n\n16.1\tThis Platform is an informational and interactive platform for Users to access various features and services, and to receive news and updates on the Premises. We have provided features including an emergency hotline and a service request function as part of our efforts to create an environment within the Premises to help our Users stay vigilant and to encourage responsible behaviour during this time – allowing them to share information, guidelines and best practices from local authorities. The Platform should not be relied on as official advice. Where data is provided, it relies on data provided by third parties and where parts of the Platform permit contributions from the User, information entered by the User.\n \n16.2\tThis Platform is not for commercial use and is intended solely for responsible use by Users. We and Smarten Spaces expressly disclaim any and all representations and warranties with respect to the Platform, including any content submitted by Users, accuracy, fitness for use and merchantability. Please refer to our section on ‘**Community Posts**’ and ‘**User Content**’ for more guidelines on how and when you should use the Community channel.\n\n16.3\tThe features and services offered through this Platform include (and are not limited to):\n \n(i)\t\u003cu\u003eEnhanced Visitor Management Solution (VMS)\u003c/u\u003e\n\nThe VMS will be enhanced with the provision of a health declaration form for visitors entering the premises owned and maintained by Us and to which the Platform is synced to (“**Premises**”).

We strive to create dialogue with Users and encourage you to share only content from official news websites on the Community channel (“**Community Posts**”).\n\nWhile we will try to check that all Community Posts comply with our acceptable use standards, we are not obligated to monitor any Community Posts. We expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of the Community Posts by any User who we view in our sole discretion to be breaching acceptable use standards. If in our opinion an individual makes use of the Community in breach of these Rules, we reserve the right to remove, or to disable access to, any Community Posts, and to terminate, suspend or change the conditions of their access to the Community channel without prior warning. We also reserve the right to bring legal proceedings against any individual for a breach of the use of the Community channel, or take such other action as we reasonably deem appropriate.\n\n- **The views expressed by any individual within the Community Posts are those of the individual and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Company.**\n- **Any advice or information posted to the Community channel should not be regarded as advice on which any reliance should be placed. We therefore disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by a user of the Community channel, or by anyone who may be informed of any of its contents. You must always seek advice from qualified professionals.**\n- **Any advice or information posted to the Community channel should not be accepted as true or correct. It is up to individual users to check the validity of any advice or information before relying on it, especially where the consequences of following it could be serious.**\n- **We may stop, or suspend, moderating the Community at any time.**\n\n(vi)\t\u003cu\u003eEmergency Hotline\u003c/u\u003e\n\nWhere available, Users may dial in to our hotline with any questions and concerns. This module enables users to request for emergency support within the Premises only. **PLEASE NOTE THAT** this is not a replacement for the local safety and security authorities. Users of their own volition shall choose to contact the Company’s security services or the local authorities.\n\nIn no event shall we and/or Smarten Spaces and its subsidiaries, its officers and employees be liable for any liability, loss, injury or risk (including, without limitation, incidental and consequential damages, personal injury/wrongful death, lost profits or damages) which is incurred or suffered as a direct or indirect result of the use of any of the material, advice, guidance or Services on this Platform.\n\n\n**17.
