<h4>6.6 Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising</h4>
<p>As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings. See <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice">http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice</a>.</p>
<p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our Third-Party advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>, or <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a>, <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/choices/">http://youradchoices.ca/choices/</a> and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>. You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics here.</p>
<p>To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes. Even if you opt out, we may still collect and use information regarding your activities on our Sites and/or information from the advertisements on Third-Party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.</p>
