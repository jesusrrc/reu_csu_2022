Products</h1></div></div><div class="w-richtext"><p>Effective date: June 5, 2018</p><p>For the prior policy effective August 31, 2017 to June 4, 2018, <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/594bf24620923a5a84fc2c8f/60c1594e516c06111be99a25_Privacy%20Policy%20for%20Nauto%20Services%20and%20Products%20(May%202018).pdf" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p><p>This Privacy Policy (â<strong>Policy</strong>â) describes what information
Nauto, Inc. and Nauto Global Limited, its service providers, and affiliates
(collectively, â<strong>Nauto,</strong>â â<strong>we</strong>,â â<strong>our</strong>â or â<strong>us</strong>â) collects
and how Nauto uses this information.

</p><p>When we talk about the â<strong>Services</strong>â in this Policy, we are
referring to the use of the Nauto device (both the device hardware and the
software which supports and interacts with the device), Nautoâs applications or
other Nauto products and services. We provide additional details about how we
collect and use information from our public website in our <a href="https://www.nauto.com/privacy/website-visitors">Privacy Policy for
Nauto Website Visitors</a>.</p><p>

Nauto
Global Limited, an Irish registered company, will provide the Services to
Nautoâs Customers in the European Union, and Nauto, Inc., a United States
company, will provide Nautoâs customers with the Services in all other
countries. Details of these Nauto
companies are set out at the end of this Policy.</p><h2>What Information Does Nauto Collect and Receive?</h2><p>Nauto may, on behalf of its
customers, collect and analyze information (including personal information)
about users (such as drivers and passengers) of the Services and other
individuals (such as members of the public whose images may be captured by the
Services). This content and information is referred to in this Policy as â<strong>Customer Data</strong>â and is controlled by
Nautoâs customersÂ . To the
extent that Nauto captures, stores and analyses Customer Data, Nauto does so on
behalf of its customers.</p><p>If you are using the Services by
invitation of a Nauto customer, whether that customer is your employer, another
organization, or an individual, Nauto collects, stores, and analyses your data
on behalf of its customer in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy,
though that customer will otherwise determine its own additional policies
regarding the treatment of Customer Data in its possession which may apply to
your use of the Services. Nauto may implement some of these policies on its
customersâ behalf. Please check with the customer about the policies it has in
place.</p><h3>1. Nauto Device and Customer Data</h3><p>The Nauto device is an
intelligent camera and sensor system that allows the collection of internal and
external event data from vehicles in order to improve driver safety and fleet
operations. Nauto devices use camera and sensor technology to scan a driverâs
environment and collect information. The deviceâs cameras are both inward and
outward facing. In addition to capturing video clips and images of drivers and
passengers, the Nauto device also collects the following types of information:</p><ul role="list"><li>GPS location </li><li>Network or internet protocol addresses</li><li>Operating system ID</li><li>Mobile network details</li><li>Nauto device identifier or registration details</li><li>Nauto device settings</li><li>Date, time and type of web requests</li></ul><p>âThe Nauto device and Services
may also collect information about a vehicleâs environment and experience while
on the road, including information about:</p><ul role="list"><li>Geographic location and relative proximity of a vehicle to other vehicles</li><li>Hazards, such as pedestrians (whose faces may be blurred), bicycles, weather, and other vehicles</li><li>Collision, near-miss, hard braking, acceleration or cornering events</li><li>Traffic patterns, speeds, and flow</li><li>Lane and road departure</li><li>License plate numbers (which may be blurred) and other information such as color or make of surrounding vehicles</li><li>Not obeying the rules of the road e.g. running a red light</li></ul><p>The Nauto device and Services may also collect other personal information about drivers (and passengers where indicated) such as: </p><ul role="list"><li>Name</li><li>Phone number</li><li>Email address</li><li>Home/work address </li><li>Driverâs license / ID information</li><li>Date of birth</li><li>Vehicle identification number ("VIN")</li><li>License plate</li><li>Emergency contact information</li><li>Face of driver</li><li>Driverâs posture and other physical characteristics when driving</li><li>Who was in a collision including passengers</li><li>Live camera feed / photo images including passengers</li><li>Audio recordings including passengers</li></ul><p>The Nauto device also uses face scanning and facial recognition software on the data captured by the Nauto device in order to create a profile of a driver for Nautoâs customers. For example, this software may create a profile based on a driverâs facial features, such as the distance between the eyes, nose and ears, for a particular driver, that it uses to connect a driver in one particular photo or video to another photo or video for customerâs benefit. Â The deviceâs software may also analyse facial features, driver behaviour, posture and movements in order to ensure safety and to prevent accidents. This is done for safety reasons in order to protect the vital interests of drivers and passengers. Â  For example, the device may process the following information about a driverâs behavior:</p><ul role="list"><li>The identity of the driver</li><li>Driver behavior and actions or inaction</li><li>Risks</li><li>Number of passengers in the vehicle</li><li>Drowsiness</li><li>Inattention (e.g., phone use, passenger activity)</li><li>Braking</li><li>Speed, acceleration, and mileage</li><li>Driving time</li><li>Nauto device tampering</li><li>Vehicle security (e.g., audio listening of broken glass, stolen vehicle)</li><li>Not obeying the rules of the road, e.g. texting while driving, ignoring traffic control signals or signs, DUI (i.e. drink-driving)</li></ul><p>Some of this information may be
considered to be sensitive personal information. Some images and information
about members of the public may also be captured by the device.

</p><p>To the extent requested by a
customer, we may create account â<strong>Profiles</strong>â
for drivers. These Profiles allow Nauto to display a driverâs Profile name and
photo, and to link that Profile with information collected by that driverâs
Nauto device. In order to create these Profiles on behalf of customers, Nauto
may collect information such as names, username, password, photographs,
location, and contact information of drives. Nauto may also collect information
derived from its use of facial scanning and facial recognition software and its
analysis of behavior, posture, and movements of persons who appear in data
captured on Nauto devices. </p><p>In addition, drivers and
passengers may transmit information to Nauto on behalf of customers by
recording a short voice note using the Nauto device. Nauto processes the voice
note on behalf of its customer to understand additional details of an incident
or passenger interaction and may use the information to offer technical or
emergency support to drivers on behalf of its Nauto customers.</p><p>The device may also, on a customerâs
behalf, collect other information about a driverâs environment and experience
on the road including a vehicleâs speed, acceleration, braking, collision
events, mileage, relative proximity to other vehicles, road conditions/hazards,
traffic patterns/density and the details of surrounding vehicles.Â </p><h3>2. Other Information Â </h3><p>Nauto may also process the
following information (collectively referred to as â<strong>Nauto Data</strong>â) in order to provide the Services to Customers:</p><p><strong>Account creation information:</strong>
Customers may create a Nauto account to make it easier to communicate with us
and access the Services we provide. To create an account, customers may be
asked to provide information such as names, usernames, passwords and contact
information. </p><p><strong>Billing and other information:</strong> Nauto or
our partners acting on our behalf may collect and store payment information
including a credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code,
billing address, and shipping address to complete transactions through our
Services.</p><p><strong>Services usage information:</strong> This is
information about customers and customer personnel who are accessing and using
the Services, which may include details of administrative, technical and
support communications with us.</p><p><strong>Log data:</strong> When our Customers use the Services
we may collect log data such as your Internet Protocol address, the date and
time of your use of the Services and cookie data.</p><h2>How Does Nauto Use the Information it Collects?</h2><h3>1. Provide and Improve Nauto Services</h3><p>Nauto may access and use Customer
Data as reasonably necessary and in accordance with a customerâs instructions
to provide and improve the Services. For example, Nauto may, on its customersâ
behalf and in accordance with their instructions, use this information to
understand and predict traffic flows, advise drivers of hazards in real time,
determine the cause and consequence of individual driving behavior and events
and develop composite safety scores for drivers.

</p><p>Nauto may also use this
information to provide technical support, to prevent or address service,
security, technical issues, to improve the quality of service Nauto provides or
at a customerâs request in connection with customer support matters. </p><p>Nauto may also use Customer Data
as set forth in our agreement with its customer or as expressly permitted in
writing by the customer or as required by law.</p><h3>2. Other Purposes</h3><p>We also use information: </p><p><strong>To understand and develop our Services:</strong> We carry
out research and analyze trends to better understand how users are using the
Services and improve them. </p><p><strong>Communicating with customer personnel and marketing:</strong> If
customer personnel contact us with a problem or question, we will use customer
personnel information to respond. We may also send customer personnel service
and administrative emails and messages. We may also contact customer personnel
to inform them about changes in our Services, our service offerings, and
important service related notices, such as security and fraud notices. These
emails and messages are considered part of the Services we are contractually
obliged to provide to customersâ personnel and, apart from marketing emails,
customer personnel may not opt-out of them. Where we send emails about new
product features or other news about Nauto, customer personnel and other
recipients can opt out of these at any time.</p><p><strong>Billing and account management:</strong> We use
account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and payments. This
processing of Nauto Data is necessary for us to provide the Services to
Customers.</p><p><strong>Investigating fraud and abuse:</strong> We work
hard to keep the Services secure and to prevent abuse and fraud. Any processing
of Nauto Data in these circumstances will be in our legitimate interests and
the legitimate interests of our customers and their personnel to have their
data kept secure and free from abuse and fraud. Processing of Customer Data in
these circumstances shall be on behalf of our customers.</p><p>Where the processing described in
this Section 2 comprises Nauto Data processing, Nauto processes such data in
accordance with its and its customersâ legitimate interests described above and
because such processing is necessary for Nauto to discharge its contractual
obligations. </p><p><strong>Use of Aggregated/De-identified data:</strong> This
Policy is not intended to place any limits on what Nauto does with data that is
aggregated and/or de-identified so the data is no longer associated with and
can no longer be linked to an identifiable user or customer of the Services.
Nauto uses aggregate or de-identified information for business purposes,
including for product improvement, analytics, industry and market research, and
other purposes consistent with Nautoâs business needs. Examples of aggregated
or de-identified information used by Nauto include information on:</p><ul role="list"><li>Road signs and traffic lights</li><li>Vehicle density and speeds</li><li>Parking spaces</li><li>Collision and near miss hotspots</li><li>Parking and stops</li><li>Risk scoring</li><li>Scenario risk, based on context (e.g. risk in a construction zone, pothole)</li><li>Location and labeling of objects such as vehicles and traffic signs</li><li>Driving paths</li><li>Risk events</li><li>Vehicle speed and change in velocity or delta-V</li><li>Dynamic aggregated data (e.g., traffic data, construction activity, weather, road conditions)</li><li>Infrastructure data (e.g., pot holes, number of lanes, lane markers, stop sign / signal locations)</li></ul><h2>How Does Nauto Share the Information It Collects?</h2><p>Nauto may share information
described in this Policy from time to time. Our customers determine their own
policies for the sharing and disclosure of Customer Data. Nauto does not
control how customers or their third parties choose to share or disclose
Customer Data.</p><p>Nauto may share Customer Data and
other information in accordance with our agreement with our customers and our
customersâ instructions, including with:</p><p><strong>Customers: </strong>Nauto may share Customer Data and
other information in accordance with our agreement with customers. This means
that customers, and third parties that customers designate to receive their
Customer Data, can receive up-to-date information about a driverâs location,
speed, driving hazards, and attentiveness, in addition to in-depth analysis of
driver safety, traffic dynamics, or insurer loss data. There may be times when
a user contacts Nauto to help resolve an issue specific to the Services. In order
to help resolve the issue and given our relationship with our customer, we may
share this concern with our customer.</p><p><strong>Third Party Service Providers and Agents: </strong>Nauto may
provide information to vendors, service providers, and other partners who help
provide the Services and who, like Nauto, will use this information in
accordance with instructions from Nautoâs customers either directly or through
Nauto. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations that
are consistent with this Policy and the agreements Nauto enters into with them.</p><p><strong>Sharing of Aggregated/De-identified Data: </strong>We may
disclose or use aggregate or de-identified information for any purpose,
including for business, public interest, or research purposes. For example, we
may use this information to advise other customers, including fleet owners and
insurers, and Nauto drivers about driving conditions and to warn them of
hazards. Nauto may also use this information to provide customers with other
fleet management services, general risk analysis and traffic analysis.</p><p><strong>Affiliates: </strong>We may engage affiliates in our
corporate group to process Customer Data in accordance with our agreement with
Customers.</p><p><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Nauto may share information in order
to comply with legal or regulatory requirements and to respond to lawful
requests, court orders and legal process.</p><p><strong>Emergency Services:</strong> Nauto may contact emergency
services and share Customer Data on behalf of its customers if there is an
accident based on information that Nauto receives from Nauto devices. This is
to protect the vital interests of drivers, passengers or members of the public.</p><p>Nauto, pursuant to its legitimate
interests and those of its customers and their users, may also share Nauto Data
in the circumstances described above. Such sharing might also be required in
order for Nauto to perform its contractual obligations in its customer
agreements. Such Nauto Data sharing may also occur in the following
circumstances:</p><p><strong>Changes to Business Structure: </strong>In the
event Nauto is involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution,
reorganization, sale of some or all of Nautoâs assets, financing, acquisition
of all or a portion of our business, a similar transaction or proceeding, or
steps in contemplation of such activities (e.g. due diligence).</p><p><strong>Fraud and Illegal Activity: </strong>Nauto may
share Nauto Data to enforce our rights, prevent fraud and for safety. This is
in order to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of us or third
parties, including enforcing contracts or policies, or in connection with
investigating and preventing fraud.</p><h2>Security and Data Retention</h2><p>Nauto takes security seriously. Nauto
maintains administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to
protect the privacy and security of the Biometric Information that it collects.
These safeguards take into account the nature of the information we collect,
process and store, and the current state of technology. The Nauto cloud is
supported by customer authorized third-party vendors and service providers that
process and store information in compliance with this Policy and any other
appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

</p><p>In addition to technological
security measures, Nauto places access controls on its employees, contractors,
and agents.</p><p>Despite these measures, Nauto
cannot guarantee that the information described in this Policy will be
completely secure.</p><p>We only retain Customer Data if
necessary in accordance with our agreement with the customer or as expressly
permitted in writing by the customer or as required to comply with our legal
obligations. Â </p><p>Most data (including most
Customer Data) are temporarily stored locally on the Nauto device and only
select data (including only select Customer Data) is sent up into the cloud.</p><p>Generally, we only store Nauto
Data for as long as is necessary for the business purposes for which the data
is processed by Nauto. This means certain account creation information and
general account information along with Services usage information will
typically be stored while the account remains active or for shorter periods if
possible. We may retain certain Nauto Data after an account has closed if
retention is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet
regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud or abuse, or enforce
this Policy and our agreements with customers. For example, certain Nauto Data
such as financial and payment information may need to be stored for a number of
years after payment is made in accordance with applicable tax and corporate
laws. Nauto may store depersonalized data, indefinitely.</p><p>As noted above, Nauto may use
face scanning technology and facial recognition software on the data captured
by the Nauto devices in order to create mathematical representations that
correspond to images of faces for purposes of identifying employees of Nautoâs
customers. Nautoâs software may also analyse and collect data from the facial
features, driver behavior, posture and movements of persons who appear on data
captured by Nauto devices, including employees of Nautoâs customers, in order
to ensure safety and to prevent accidents. Nauto may also collect and store
other information derived from or based upon biological attributes that may be
used to identify a person. Nauto protects all such information using the same
or more strict security procedures that it uses to protect other confidential
and sensitive data.</p><p>Generally, Nauto retains such
information for no longer than is reasonably necessary. Subject to legal
obligations and restrictions, Nauto will make reasonable, good-faith efforts to
permanently destroy all such information pertaining to a person under the
following circumstances:</p><ul role="list"><li>If Nauto has created a Profile for a person and Nauto does not collect
information corresponding to the personâs Profile for six continuous months;</li><li>If three years have passed since the last interaction between Nauto and
the person. A person who remains employed by a Nauto customer âinteractsâ with
Nauto so long as that person remains employed by the Nauto customer;</li><li>If Nauto is informed by a customer, in writing, that the person is no
longer employed by the customer; or</li><li>If
a person requests, in writing, permanent deletion of all information relating
to that person.</li></ul><h2>Childrenâs Information</h2><p>The Services are not directed at
children under 13 years. If you learn that a child under 13 has provided us
with personal information without parental or guardian consent, please contact
us. Should our Services capture information about children (as passengers or
outside the relevant vehicle), this information will only be processed on
behalf of customers where it is in the vital safety interests of children or
those of others or where the processing is in our customersâ legitimate
interests or those of the children or the public.</p><h2>International Data Transfers</h2><p>If you are using the Services in
the European Union or other regions outside of the United States with laws
governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, be advised
that Nauto may transfer your information, Customer Data and Nauto Data to the
United States and other countries with differing data protection laws and
differing government agency data access rules. By using the Services, you
explicitly consent to that transfer. Nauto Inc., complies with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information

to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield
Framework. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and these
Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn
more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please

Principles, Nauto Inc. has responsibility for the processing of personal
information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to
a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Nauto complies with the Privacy
Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the
E.U., including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p><p>

In
compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Nauto commits to resolve
complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. European
Union individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield
policy should first contact Nauto at privacy@nauto.com. Â If there is a dispute that we are unable to

you are unsatisfied with the resolution of your complaint, you may contact JAMS
at https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for further information and
assistance. You may also have the ability, under certain conditions, to invoke
binding arbitration for complaints regarding Privacy Shield compliance not
resolved by a complaint to Nauto or through JAMS. More information related to
this arbitration procedure is available at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction</a>. Nauto is subject to the investigatory and
enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission with respect to its
compliance with the Privacy Shield.</p><h2>Data Subject Rights</h2><p>If your personal data is comprised in Customer Data, then you should contact the customer in relation to any statutory rights you may have to access, rectify, erase, restrict or object to customerâs processing of your data.</p><p>If your personal data is comprised in Nauto Data, then you may have rights to rectify, erase, restrict and object to Nauto processing your personal data.
