</ul>

<p><strong>Opting Out of Cookie Tracking</strong></p>
<p>You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place Cookies on your computer or limit the type of Cookies you allow. Flash Cookies operate differently than browser Cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash Cookies.</p>
<p>Please be advised that if you disable Cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of our Services because the Cookies are necessary to track and enhance your game activities.</p>
<h4>3.4 Third-party Websites, Social Media Platforms and Software Development Kits</h4>
<p>The Site may contain links to other websites, and other websites may reference or link to our Site or other Services. These other domains and websites are not controlled by us, and we do not endorse, screen or approve and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites or applications. We encourage our users to read the privacy policies of each and every website and application with which they interact. You visit these other websites or applications at your own risk.</p>
<p>Peak’ Services may include publicly accessible blogs, community forums or private messaging features. The Site and our other Services may also contain links and interactive features with various social media platforms (e.g., widgets). If you already use these platforms, their Cookies may be set on your device when using our Site or other Services. You should be aware that Personal Information that you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, social media platform or otherwise online or that you share in an open forum may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We are unable to control such uses of your information when you interact with a social media platform, and by using such services, you assume the risk that the Personal Information you provided may be viewed and used by Third Parties for any number of purposes.</p>
<h4>3.5 Third-party Payment Processing</h4>
<p>We may sell Virtual Items or Merchandise through our Services. When you make purchases through the Services, we process your payments through a Third-party application, including the Apple App Store, Google Play App Store, Amazon App Store (together with any similar applications, “App Stores”) and Social Networking Sites (“SNS”) such as Facebook. The Third-party application may collect certain financial information from you to process a payment on behalf of Peak, including your name, email address, address and other billing information. App Stores do not share this information they collect from you with us.</p>
<h3>4. How We May Disclose Your Information</h3>
<p>Third-party Websites, Social Media Platforms, and Software Development Kits</p>
<p>We may share your information as described in this Privacy Policy (to provide the Services with our Third-party Service Providers; to comply with legal obligations; to protect and defend our rights and property) or with your consent.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service Providers</strong>. We may share any information we receive with Service Providers. The types of Service Providers (processors) to whom we entrust Personal Information include Service Providers for: (i) provision of IT and related services; (ii) provision of information and services you have requested; (iii) payment processing; (iv) customer service activities; and (v) in connection with the provision of the Services. Peak has executed appropriate contracts with the Service Providers that prohibit them from using or sharing Personal Information except as necessary to perform the contracted services on our behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Business Partners</strong>. Peak may share Personal Information with our Business Partners and affiliates for our and our affiliates’ internal business purposes or to provide you with the Services that you have requested. Peak may also provide Personal Information to Business Partners with whom we may jointly offer products or Services. In such cases, our business partner’s name will appear, along with Peak. Peak requires our affiliates and Business Partners to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality and security of Personal Information they maintain on our behalf and not to use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which Peak provided them.</li>
<li><strong>Displaying to Friends and Other Users</strong>.  Our Services support you to interact with other players. If you play our games through a social network or register through a social network (for example, Facebook Connect), your social network friends will see your name, profile photo and descriptions of your game activity. Similarly, other players, regardless of whether they are your social network friends or not, will be able to see descriptions of your game activity, communicate with you within our Services if you use the chat feature of our games and view your game profile, which may include your name or a “game name” and your profile photo. In certain cases, your profile photo can reveal your social network ID or player ID, and access to a social network ID or player ID may allow others to view the public information associated with your related social network profile or the game account. Also, the content you post may be displayed in the chat feature of the Games. We are not responsible for privacy practices of the other users who will view and use the posted information.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing - Interest-based or Targeted Advertising and Third-party Marketing</strong>. Through our Services, Peak may allow Third-party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., Cookies) to collect the following information within our Services:</li>
<li>performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);</li>
<li>certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-persistent device identifiers such as Advertising ID and de-identified persistent device identifiers such as a hashed Android ID);</li>
<li>your social network ID;</li>
<li>other contextual data about your game play (for example, your level and session length); and</li>
<li>pseudonymous data, not directly identifying information (e.g., OS name and versions, device models, time stamp).</li>
</ul>
<p>These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) to measure how effective ads are for delivering targeted advertisements to you about our games within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based or targeted advertising.” We may allow access to other data collected by the Services to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disclosures to Protect Us or Others (e.g., as Required by Law and Similar Disclosures)</strong>. We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate: (i) to comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) to respond to your requests; (iii) to protect yours, ours or others’ rights, property or safety; (iv) to enforce Peak' policies or contracts; (v) to collect amounts owed to Peak; (vi) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (vii) if we, in good faith, believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes—e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies, so they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers</strong>. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. In such event, Peak will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information was collected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. International Transfer   </h3>
<p>All Personal Information collected via or by Peak may be stored anywhere in the world, including, but not limited to, in Turkey, the United States, the European Union, in the cloud, on our servers and on the servers of our affiliates or the servers of our Service Providers. When we transfer your Personal Information internationally, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that it is treated securely, lawfully and in the manner,  we describe here. Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so the privacy laws applicable to the places where your information is transferred to or stored, used or processed in may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you are resident.</p>
<p>By providing information to Peak, you consent to the storage of your Personal Information in these locations.</p>
<p><strong>If you are using our Services from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your information to Turkey and the United States and to Processing of your data globally.</strong></p>
<p>By choosing to visit the Site, utilize the Services or otherwise provide information to us, you agree that any dispute over privacy or the terms contained in this Privacy Policy will be governed by the laws of Turkey and the adjudication of any disputes arising in connection with Peak or the Site will be in accordance with the Terms Services.</p>
<h3>6. Opt Out (Right to Restrict Processing)</h3>
<p>You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information. When you have consented to Peak’ processing of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt out to further Processing by opening an in-game support ticket or, alternatively, by contacting <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84f4f6edf2e5e7fdc4f4e1e5efaae7ebe9"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e696948f9087859fa69683878dc885898b">[email protected]</span></a>. Even if you opt out, we may still collect and use anonymized, non-Personal Information regarding your activities on our Services.</p>
<p>Please also note that certain records, for example, those relating to payments or customer service matters, will be held for legal and accounting purposes. If you have sent content through or posted content on the Service, we may not be able to delete it.</p>
<h4>Email Communications</h4>
<p>If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can use the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email to opt out of receiving future emails. We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. Note that you will continue to receive transaction-related emails regarding products or Services you have requested.</p>
<h4>Mobile Devices</h4>
<p>Peak may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications with game updates, high scores and other notices that may be of interest to you. You may at any time opt out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings on your mobile device. Peak may also collect location-based information if you use our mobile applications. You can opt out of this collection by changing the settings on your mobile device.</p>
<h4><strong>Cookies</strong> and Interest-based or Targeted Advertising</h4>
<p>As noted, you may stop or restrict the placement of Cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. To learn more about and manage flash Cookies, visit the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Adobe Website</a> and make changes at the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html" target="_blank">Global Privacy Settings Panel</a>.</p>
<p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> or <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">Your Online Choices</a> and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based advertising</a>. You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-opt-out/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh?hl=en " target="_blank">here</a>. Please note that these opt out tools are provided by Third Parties, and Peak does not operate or control these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.</p>
<p>On mobile devices, you can reset the Advertising Identifier (like an IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous Advertising Identifier. Furthermore, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s “AppChoices” app, that provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for tailored advertising. Like the opt out tools mentioned for web, these opt out tools are provided by Third Parties, and Peak does not operate or control these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.</p>
<p>To be clear, whether you are using our opt out or an online industry opt out, these cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.</p>
<h3>7. Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction</h3>
<p>You have the right to request access to and rectification or erasure of Personal Information or restriction of processing, the right to object and the right to data portability.</p>
<p>The general right to object applies to all types of processing described in this Privacy Policy. Unlike the right to object against processing for direct marketing purposes, we are only obliged to follow an objection if you state specific grounds relating to your particular situation.</p>
<p>When otherwise permitted by applicable law, you can open a support ticket within the Games or, alternatively, send an e-mail to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7000021906111309300015111b5e131f1d"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0272706b7463617b42726763692c616d6f">[email protected]</span></a> to request access to, receive (port), seek rectification or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by Peak. Please include your full name, user identifier, the email address associated with your account and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with applicable laws.</p>
<p>Although Peak makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Peak is unable to provide access, including but not limited to when the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or when it is commercially proprietary. If Peak determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Peak will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.</p>
<h3>8. Data Retention</h3>
<p>Peak retains the Personal Information collected as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements and comply with applicable laws.</p>
<h3>9. Security of Your Information</h3>
<p>The Personal Information that you provide to Peak is stored on servers that are located in secured facilities and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure industry-standard security of such information, such as firewalls and data encryption. However, no server, computer or communications network or system or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Peak strives to protect your information, Peak cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Peak or through the Services.</p>
<p>By using the Services or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security privacy, and administrative issues related to your use of the Services. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the Services or sending an e-mail to you or via push notification.</p>
<h3>10. Children’s Privacy</h3>
<p>The Services are not directed to children under 13, and Peak does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under 13.  If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under the age of 13 (or under 16 in certain jurisdictions in the European Union) who uses our games, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7505071c0314160c350510141e5b161a18"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="91e1e3f8e7f0f2e8d1e1f4f0fabff2fefc">[email protected]</span></a>.  We will delete your child’s Personal Information if we are able to identify your child unless you provide us with your verifiable consent for your child to continue to use our games.</p>
<h3>11. Redress/Compliance and Accountability</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about our privacy practices or this Privacy Policy, please contact Peak by email at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4535372c3324263c053520242e6b262a28"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0b7b79627d6a68724b7b6e6a6025686466">[email protected]</span></a>. We will address your concerns and attempt to resolve any privacy issues in a timely manner.</p>
<h3>12. Changes to Our Privacy Policy and Practices</h3>
<p>Revision to the Privacy Policy. We may revise this Privacy Policy at our sole discretion, so review it periodically. If you continue to visit this Site and use the services made available to you after such changes have been made, you hereby provide your consent to the changes.</p>
<p>Posting of Revised Privacy Policy. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, Peak will notify you by email or as otherwise required by applicable law. We will post adjustments to the Privacy Policy on this web page, and the revised version will be effective immediately when it is posted (or upon notice as applicable). If you are concerned about how your information is used, bookmark this page and read this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
<p>New Uses of Personal Information. Additionally, before we use Personal Information for any new purpose not originally authorized by you, we will endeavor to provide information regarding the new purpose and give you the opportunity to opt out. When consent of the Individual for the Processing of Personal Information is otherwise required by law or contract, Peak will endeavor to comply with the law or contract.</p>
<h3>13. California Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, a list of the Third Parties to whom we have disclosed their Personal Information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of Personal Information disclosed to those parties. Peak does not share Personal Information with Third Parties for their own marketing purposes.</p>
<h3>14. Contact Info of Data Controller</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about the privacy practices or this Privacy Policy, please contact Peak’ data protection officer by email at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b4c4c6ddc2d5d7cdf4c4d1d5df9ad7dbd9"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0d7d7f647b6c6e744d7d686c66236e6260">[email protected]</span></a>.</p>
