<li>Some of our Products or Services – for example our FirstNet service – may be covered by their own privacy policies or additional privacy terms and conditions, while, U-verse TV is governed by the <a href="http://www.directv.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DIRECTV privacy policy.</a></li>
<li>Some of our affiliates – such as DIRECTV and Cricket – have their own privacy policies that apply to data they collect from products, services and apps they provide. Any data collected subject to this Policy that is shared
                                with those affiliates will still be protected consistent with this Policy.</li>
<li>Some areas both inside and outside of the United States – for example California and the European Union – require us to adopt different policy terms and commitments in accordance with local laws.</li>
<li>In certain cases, when you’re using your AT&amp;T Products or Services, other companies may be collecting information, so that your information may be covered by this Policy and other privacy policies at the same time. Here
                                are some examples: if you purchase one of our Products or Services from a retailer; if you use our Services to connect to a social networking service or another company’s Wi-Fi network; or if you provide your information
                                to another company through a co-branded website, app or service controlled by the other company. In those cases, any information you provide to those companies may be subject to just their policy, or subject to both their
                                policy and ours.</li>
<li>If you are an AT&amp;T business customer, we may have written Product or Service agreements that contain specific provisions about confidentiality, security or handling of information. When one of those agreements differs from
                                or conflicts with this Policy, the terms of those agreements will apply instead.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Sharing information across the AT&amp;T affiliates</h5>
<p>Like many large companies, AT&amp;T is made up of many affiliates. Our Products and Services are developed, managed, marketed and sold by a variety of our affiliates. We share information that may identify you personally internally
                            among <br/><a aria-label="open modal dialog: AT&amp;T affiliates" data-open="affiliates-modal" href="#" role="button">our affiliates<i class="icon icon-button"><span>Button Icon</span></i></a>, such as DIRECTV and
                            Cricket. For information collected under this Policy, we require the affiliate to use, share and protect the information consistent with this Policy including honoring your communications preferences for first-party marketing
                            of their products and services, your advertising consents and your California Data Rights. We may also combine information that identifies you personally with data that comes from an app or affiliate that has a different privacy
                            policy. When we do that, our Policy applies to the combined data set.</p>
<h5>Sharing information with non-AT&amp;T companies that provide services for us or for you</h5>
<p>We share information that identifies you personally with vendors that perform services for us or that support Products or Services provided to you, including marketing or ad delivery services. We do not require consent for sharing
                            with our vendors for these purposes. We do not allow those vendors to use your information for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get
                            from us in a way that’s consistent with this Policy.</p>
<h5>Sharing information with non-AT&amp;T companies to enable third party services to you</h5>
<p>We may share information with non-AT&amp;T companies for their purposes to provide you services such as verifying or authenticating your identity, detecting fraud, protecting your financial accounts, and authorizing transactions.
                            We do not allow those non-AT&amp;T companies to use it for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us in a way that’s consistent
                            with this Policy. You are in control of this sharing. If you’re an AT&amp;T Prepaid customer, text “STOP” to 8010 to stop sharing with third party services or “RESUME” to restart sharing at any time. Other customers can opt

<h5>Sharing information with other non-AT&amp;T companies or entities</h5>
<p>There are also times when we provide information that identifies you personally to other companies and entities, such as government agencies, credit bureaus and collection agencies, without your consent, but where authorized or
                            required by law. Reasons to share include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complying with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests and as otherwise authorized or required by law. Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement agencies,
                                as well as parties to civil lawsuits. You can find out more about this in our <a href="https://about.att.com/csr/home/governance/transparency.html" target="_blank">Transparency Report</a>.</li>

<li>Providing or obtaining payment for your service.</li>
<li>Routing your calls or other communications.</li>
<li>Ensuring network operations and security.</li>
<li>Notifying, responding or providing information (including location information) to a responsible governmental entity in emergency circumstances or in situations involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury.</li>
<li>Alerting the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to information concerning child pornography of which we become aware through the provision of our services. </li>
<li>Enforcing our legal rights, protecting our network and property or defending against legal claims.</li>
<li>Complying with legal requirements to share the names, addresses and telephone numbers of non-mobile phone customers with phone directory publishers and directory assistance services. We honor your request for non-published
                                or non-listed numbers.</li>
<li>Providing name and number information for wireline and wireless CallerID and related services, like Call Trace. This means a person receiving a call can see the name and number of the caller.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Sharing Metrics Reports with non-AT&amp;T companies</h5>
<p>Sometimes the services you enjoy from us directly involve other businesses. For example, we may be paid by an advertiser to deliver an advertisement or by a business customer to provide its employee with a service. We may also
                            collect information, including location and web browsing data, from visitors to sites where we provide Wi-Fi services. In such cases, we may use or share information that doesn’t identify you personally to provide metrics reports
                            to our business customers and service suppliers. We may also share it with advertising and other companies to deliver or assess the effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns.</p>
<h5>Sharing information for research</h5>
<p>We may share information that doesn’t identify you personally with other companies and entities for research.  When we share this information, we require companies and entities to agree not to attempt or to allow others to
                            use it to identify individuals.  Our agreements will also prevent businesses from reusing or reselling the information and require that they will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with this Policy.</p>
<h5>Sharing Aggregate Insights</h5>
<p>We may share with third parties insights about AT&amp;T’s operations, network or services derived from aggregated customer data (data grouped so as not to identify you personally).</p>
<h5>Sharing information with AT&amp;T affiliates and non-AT&amp;T companies for advertising and marketing programs</h5>
<p>We may share information with AT&amp;T affiliates and with non-AT&amp;T companies to deliver or assess effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns as described in Privacy Choices and Controls.</p>
<h5>Sharing information to support location services</h5>
<p>Location services rely on, use or incorporate the location of a device to provide or enhance the service. Location services may collect and use or share location information to power applications on your device (those that are
                            pre-loaded or those that you chose to download), such as mapping and traffic apps, or other location services you subscribe to.  AT&amp;T will not share your location information for location services without your consent
                            (to us or a company providing you service), except as required by law.  If you purchase location services from another company, such as a medical alerting device, the use or disclosure of location information is governed
                            by the agreement between you and the service provider, including any applicable privacy policy of the service provider, and is not governed by this privacy policy<i>.  </i>In other cases – for example parental controls
                            services - the account holder for the location services, instead of a user, may initiate or subscribe to the location services and provide the required consent.</p>

<h5>Choices about how we use and share your information for advertising, marketing and analytics</h5>
<p>You have choices about whether your information is used or shared in our programs that provide you with marketing and advertising tailored to your interests and for aggregate analytics.  As your provider of communications
                            and internet services, our collection and use of information operates independently in many cases from the user controls and settings on your device, through your operating system, or on third-party websites or apps.</p>
<p><b>Online behavioral advertising:</b> Online behavioral advertising is automated, customized advertising that you see when using online services, like ads in mobile apps or on websites. Those ads are served to you based on inferences
                            about your interests.  Those interests are determined from data collected about you, whether by AT&amp;T or other parties.</p>
<ul>
<li>We work with ad companies that may serve ads for us, and for others, across your use of online services. These companies may use cookies, mobile advertising identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your
                                use of our websites and other websites. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track online activities and deliver ads and content tailored to your interests as part of our advertising programs,

<ul>
<li><b>Relevant Advertising:</b> This program is used to tailor the ads you see to match your interests. It doesn’t give you more advertising—it just makes the ads you see more likely to be relevant to you. If you don’t want to

<li><u>Information we use for Relevant Advertising</u>: As part of this program, we use information about your use of our Products and Services, like information about the apps you use or the websites you visit, your video
                                        viewing, or your location. We also use information from companies like our advertising partners. By using demographic information like ZIP code and age range, we may place you into demographic or interest categories
                                        like “sports enthusiast” or “coffee lover.” We also use this information to deliver and assess effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns.</li>
<li><u>Information we don’t use for Relevant Advertising</u>: We don’t use sensitive information – like medical conditions or financial account records – that you share securely. We also don’t use information about the

                                        companies that are involved in creating and delivering advertisements.  When we share that information, we combine it with an identifier like a device or ad ID (such as Apple or Android Ad ID).</li>

With your consent, this program lets us use and share additional information as outlined in the <a href="https://www.att.com/legal/terms.enhancedRelevantAdvertising.html" target="_blank">program</a>. In addition, by using information from testing and running our network, we may infer websites visited or videos viewed over a secure connection for advertising and marketing purposes. You can

                            PI may have occurred:</p>

                            These requests for disclosure are generally free.</p>
<p><b><i>Your Right To Request The Deletion Of CCPA PI</i></b></p>
<p>Upon your request, we will delete the CCPA PI we have collected about you, except for situations when that information is necessary for us to: provide you with a good or service that you requested; perform a contract we entered
                            into with you; maintain the functionality or security of our systems; comply with or exercise rights provided by the law; or use the information internally in ways that are compatible with the context in which you provided
                            the information to us, or that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us.</p>
<p>To exercise your right to request the deletion of your CCPA PI, either <a href="/csr/home/privacy/StateLawApproach/ccpa.html"><b>visit our CCPA page</b></a> or contact us at 866-385-3193. Requests for deletion of your CCPA
                            PI are generally free.</p>
<p class="not-break-on-print"><b><i>Your Right To Ask Us Not To Sell Your CCPA PI</i></b></p>

                            doing so.  </p>

<p class="not-break-on-print"><b><i>Verification of Identity — Access or Deletion Requests</i></b></p>
<p class="not-break-on-print"><b><i>Password Protected Account. </i></b>If you maintain a password-protected account with us, in most cases you may submit an access or deletion request by authenticating yourself with a password like you would when you access
                            your account (see exceptions below in the following paragraph). You’ll have to authenticate yourself again to access your data or submit your deletion request.</p>
<p class="not-break-on-print"><b><i>Former Accountholders, Non-Accountholders (without Password Protected Account) – and also FirstNet, Prepaid and .net accounts. </i></b>If you do not have a password protected account – or have a FirstNet, prepaid or .net
                            account – we will ask to verify your identity using our mobile verification process. This process captures an image of your identity document, such as your driver’s license, and compares it to a self-photo you submit. We will
                            only use this information to verify your identity. We will delete it after the time expires allowed by the CCPA to process and respond to your request.</p>
<p>If we cannot verify your identity, we will notify you that we will not be able to respond to your request.</p>
<p class="not-break-on-print"><b><i>Authorized Agents</i></b></p>
<p>You may designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. Your agent will need a valid power of attorney or written permission signed by you. If the agent relies on written permission, we’ll need to verify the agent’s
                            identity. We may also contact you directly to confirm the permission. Your authorized agent can submit your requests by calling us at 866-385-3193.</p>
<p class="not-break-on-print"><b><i>We Don’t Mind If You Exercise Your California Data Rights</i></b></p>
<p>We are committed to providing you with control over your CCPA PI. If you exercise any of these rights explained in this section of the Privacy Policy, we will not disadvantage you. You will not be denied or charged different prices
                            or rates for goods or services or provided a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>
<p class="not-break-on-print"><b><i>Consumers Under 16 Years Old</i></b></p>
<p>As of the effective date of this policy, we do not have actual knowledge that we sell CCPA PI of consumers under 16 years of age. If we collect CCPA PI that we know is from a child under 16 years old in the future, we will not
                            sell that information unless we receive affirmative permission to do so. If a child is between 13 and 16 years of age, the child may provide that permission. </p>

<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content="">
<p>CPNI is information about your telecommunications and VoIP (internet phone) services from us, including what plans you subscribe to, how you use these services and details such as who you have called. (Your telephone number, name
                            and address are not considered CPNI.) We use CPNI internally and share it outside AT&amp;T only when conforming with applicable regulations and orders of the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
<p>We do not share CPNI with anyone outside of the <a aria-label="open modal dialog: AT&amp;T affiliates" data-open="affiliates-modal" href="#" role="button">AT&amp;T affiliates<i class="icon icon-button"><span>Button Icon</span></i></a>                            defined above or our authorized agents or vendors without your consent, with the following authorized exceptions: Court orders; as authorized by law; fraud detection; to provide your service and route your calls; for network
                            operations and security; aggregate (grouped) information and information that doesn’t identify you personally.</p>
<p>We do use your CPNI internally. We may share information about our customers among the AT&amp;T affiliates and our agents to offer new or enhanced services or promotions. We can also use your CPNI for the purpose of turning it
                            into aggregate data or information that does not personally identify you.</p>
<a id="cpnicontact" name="cpnicontact"></a>
<p>It is your right and our duty under federal law to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI.</p>
<p>If you don’t want us to use your CPNI internally for things like offers, here is what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opt-out at <a href="https://www.att.com/ecpnioptout/InitiateCPNIForm.action" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">att.com/cpni/optout</a>.</li>
<li>Call us at (800) 315.8303, any time of day, and follow the prompts.</li>
<li>Chat with a service representative at (800) 288.2020 (consumer) or (800) 321.2000 (business).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to restrict our use of your CPNI, it won’t affect your ability to use any of your services. You can change your mind at any time about letting us use or not use your CPNI. If you restrict your CPNI use, you may still
                            get marketing from us, but it won’t be based on using your CPNI.</p>

<h1>Cookies and Other Technologies</h1>
<h5>Definitions</h5>
<p>Let's start with what we mean when we use the word "cookie" and other related terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Cookies</b> are small data files. Websites place them in your browser to recognize your computer or mobile device when you return to that site. Cookies are created to keep track of your movements within the site, help you resume where you
                left off, remember your registered username, preferences and other customizations.</p>
<p>There are a couple of important things to remember about cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on some websites. You’ll need to perform the opt out procedure if you opt out of a program or service and then change computers or Web browsers, or clear or erase the digital
                    "cookie" that lets us know you opted out.</li>
<li><b>Local Storage Cookies.</b> Local Storage is a convenient, flexible, secure and faster way to store HTTP state data. It is a method by which our web pages locally store named key/value pairs in a user’s web browser. Local storage on
                    ATT.com is mainly used to store and retrieve data in HTML pages from our domains. Local storage data is session-based and will not persist once the session is over and the browser is closed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Flash Cookies</b> (also called Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") are similar to cookies, except that they can store more complex data. They are used to remember your settings, preferences and usage, and other similar services. Flash
            cookies allow functionality and availability of certain services. If disabled, these services may not function correctly. While browser cookies may be removed or blocked via web browser settings, flash cookies operate differently. Please note
            that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.adobe.com/devnet/security.html__;!!BhdT!nFJoze5YEw8tOic-X_oci97aBzU8BO3KHp6--XoowgJweUsEMqN4zZk5ShDPUNl9BQrBGd1GQnL7Z5o3NA$" target="_blank">Adobe website</a> and make changes at <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html__;!!BhdT!nFJoze5YEw8tOic-X_oci97aBzU8BO3KHp6--XoowgJweUsEMqN4zZk5ShDPUNl9BQrBGd1GQnKZdC2bcQ$" target="_blank">Global Storage Settings Panel</a>.</li>
<li><b>Web beacons</b> are small graphic images on a Web page or in an e-mail. They can be used for things like recording the pages and advertisements that users click on, or tracking how well an e-mail marketing campaign performs.</li>
<li>A <b>widget</b> is a small program or application that can be embedded in a web page. It can provide real-time information, such as stock quotes or weather reports. Widgets are often provided by a third party and allow them to collect data about
            users viewing that page.</li>
<li>A <b>server log</b> records your web activity by your computer or mobile device and plays a key role in improving web page performance and introducing new features. For example, it may record which search terms you’ve entered, or the links you’ve
            clicked on. It may also record your browser information, such as your IP address, device type, how long you spend on a Web page, and your browser's cookies.</li>
<li>Some websites have “<b>social network or other third-party plug-ins</b>.” These plug-ins may provide information back to those sites, even if you don't click on or interact with the plug-in. It may also apply even if you don’t have an account
            with them. Social networks or third parties may use an identifier when transmitting from your browser. This might include information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address and the URL of the web page where the
            plug-in appears. If you use social networking tools or sites, we recommend you take a moment to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Managing Cookies</h5>
<p>Most browsers will allow you to delete, disable and choose what cookies can be placed on your computer. If you want more information about controlling cookies, visit these sites for the browser you are using:</p>

<h1>AT&amp;T Consumer Marketing</h1>
<p>AT&amp;T will maintain a company-specific (Internal) Do Not Mail (DNM) list of existing and prospective residential customers who request not to receive any AT&amp;T marketing materials via US Postal Mail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers must contact the AT&amp;T residential care center at 1-800-288-2020 and specify each individual member of the household and each associated address to be added to the DNM list.</li>
