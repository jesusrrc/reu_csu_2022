anti-slavery and human trafficking policy1. modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. it takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labor, and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s 6 liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.
2. we are also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to tackling modern slavery throughout our supply chains, consistent with our disclosure obligations under the modern slavery act 2015. we expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers, and other business partners, and as part of our contracting processes, we include specific prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory, or trafficked labor, or anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children, and we expect that our suppliers will hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.
3. this policy applies to all persons working for us or on our behalf in any capacity, including employees at all levels, directors, officers, agency workers, seconded workers, volunteers, interns, agents, contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives, and business partners.
4. this policy does not form part of any employee’s contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.
gifts and entertainment policythe acceptance of gifts and entertainment by employees and directors or members of their family may present a conflict of interest. while employees and directors are permitted to accept gifts of nominal value, they are prohibited from accepting anything that might influence their judgment on company matters affecting the donor or that might be accompanied by any express or implied understanding that the recipient is in any way obligated to take some action which would benefit the donor to the detriment of the company in exchange for the gift. similarly, employees may accept entertainment, but only insofar as it is reasonable in the context of the business at hand and facilitates the company’s interests. when practical and appropriate, hospitality should be reciprocated. employees are strictly prohibited from soliciting gifts, gratuities, or business courtesies for the benefit of any family member or friend.
