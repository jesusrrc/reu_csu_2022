sharing
sim does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. sim may, from time to time, share aggregated demographic information with our partners and affiliates, and we recognize our liability related to the transfer of that data. however, in those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. in addition, sim may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. all such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to sim, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. it is our responsibility to ensure that the trusted partners we share data with are processing the information consistent with the best principles possible, and we have chosen to follow principles as outlined by the privacy shield principles. otherwise, we remain liable for the data we have shared.
