we collect personal information that you send to reed college, or permit us to obtain from third parties, for purposes relevant to college operations in pursuit of its academic mission. examples include information needed for student admission (including financial aid information), employment, bookstore ordering, gifts, and topical surveys.

data retention and deletion
we comply with all applicable regulations regarding retention and deletion of personal data and retain information only as long as it is needed for college operations and strategic planning.
