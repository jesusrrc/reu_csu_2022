you agree that evrythng shall have the right to collect and analyse data and other information relating to the provision, use and performance of various aspects of the product cloud services and related systems and technologies. evrythng will be free to (i) use such information and data to enhance its services and for other development, diagnostic and corrective purposes in connection with its services, and (ii) maintain anonymised data, which is obtained in the course of performing services, in evrythng’s databases for continuous product enhancement, validation of its professional norms and standards development, and for benchmarking and industry standards, provided that (i) such data will only be used or disclosed in an aggregated or other de-identified form (not capable of identifying any individual), and (ii) evrythng will ensure that where such data is derived from a customer or subscriber’s data, neither customer, subscriber nor any specific transaction or event will be identifiable from any such data or information.

how and why we collect and use information

we also collect, use and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. aggregated data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. for example, we may aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific product cloud feature. however, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.
we do not collect any special categories of personal data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.

cookies

international transfers
some of our external third parties are based outside the uk and/or eea so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the eea.
whenever we transfer your personal data out of the uk and/or eea, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the european commision.
where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the european commission which give personal data the same protection it has in europe.
where we use providers based in the us, we may transfer data to them if they have entered into a contract with us which incorporates the european commission’s model clauses.
please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data outside of the uk and/or eea.
change of purpose
we will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. if you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
if we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

if you follow any of the third-party links, plug-ins or applications you find on this site, our privacy policy does not extend to third party sites. clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. we do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. when you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.

security
we have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. in addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. they will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
we have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

you have the right to ask us not to process your information for marketing purposes. you may exercise your right to prevent such processing at any time by contacting us at the address stated at the end of this privacy policy.

you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
we try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. in this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the information commissioner’s office (ico), the uk supervisory authority for data protection issues. we would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ico so please contact us in the first instance.
