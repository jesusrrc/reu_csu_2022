purpose and legal basis for the processing of personal data
we process your personal data for certain purposes, described below. we have various legal bases for the processing of your personal data. these legal bases are typically: consent, necessity for the performance of a contract or a legitimate interest. legitimate interests includes: providing our services, web analytics, marketing and advertising, research and analysis to improve our products and services. at all times we use and retain only the necessary data and attempt to limit the privacy impact to the extent possible.
legitimate interest to process public data
we may process public personal data of social media authors, outlet owners or personnel, based on our legitimate interests. in this specific case our legitimate interest is to provide our commercial services to our customers, by allowing our customers to learn more about their brand, customers and their competitors. this legal basis requires a balancing of the legitimate interests of dashmote with the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the concerned data subjects.
the personal data dashmote might process from such data subjects is all publicly available – and made available – by the concerned data subjects. we do not collect private personal data of such data subjects. moreover, we do not intend to process their personal data as such. however, for example reviews, expressions and perceptions of social media authors might – to the extent broadly based – be extremely relevant for brand owners for their overall brand strategy. our services explicitly do not involve or enable profiling of or targeting individuals nor result in automated decision making activities. ultimately, our services aim to provide our customers valuable overall location insights, trend insights and market intelligence to drive informed business decisions at a non-personal level.
we also apply appropriate measures as aggregation, anonymization and the use of algorithms to exclude personal data from the services we provide to our customers. dashmote is therefore convinced that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects are not prejudiced by and do not override the legitimate interest of dashmote in the context of its processing of personal data.
when we process your personal data on the basis of consent, you have, at any time, the right to withdraw your consent. you can opt-out from our marketing communications by clicking the “unsubscribe button” in our communications or by contacting us (see the ‘contact us’ section below).
