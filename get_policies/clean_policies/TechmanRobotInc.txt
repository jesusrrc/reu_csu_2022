improving the world of work withcollaborative robots
improving the world of work withcollaborative robots
we envision a world where humans and robots work in harmony to achieve excellence.our collaborative robots (cobots) can perform a wide range of intelligent, automated taskswith applications in many industries – from education, to food, to electronics manufacturing.
cobot-enhanced quality and productivity
cobots can handle many tasks such as machine tending, assembly, packaging, welding, painting, buffing,or palletizing with precision, enhancing quality and productivity in modern industrial settings.
cobots perform these tasks alongside humans, helping them work better and faster in safe, shared spaces.with innovative features like built-in vision systems, simple programming, and automatic halt mechanisms that activate upon collision with another object,our cobot applications can help increase your productivity and become more competitive with smart factory setups.
whatever you’re looking for from collaborative robot manufacturers, we have a solution for it.

your collaborative robot family
improve the overall performance of your manufacturing and assembly lines with collaborative robots like the tm robot series,a family of collaborative robotic arms with built-in robot vision systems.our cobots can support payloads ranging from regular to heavy loads.smart, simple, safe tm — the tm robot series helps establish a harmonious work environmentwhere humans and machines collaborate and excel.
what makes cobots different?
what sets our cobots apart from the industry-standard robot arms is our “robot vision.”our collaborative robots have the ability to sense their environment and people they operate with.the hardware combined with the application makes this smart factory setup possible.
by giving cobots ‘eyes’ to see, it creates a world of difference in how they can perform. look no further for a cobot manufacturer.
