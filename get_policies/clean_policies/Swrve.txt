the security of your personal information is very important to us.  we take all reasonable and appropriate measures to guard against accidental, unauthorized or unlawful loss, access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of your personal information, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal information. we use industry-standard security measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of any personal information we own or process on behalf of our customers and visitors, including, in appropriate circumstances, the use of firewalls, restricted access and encrypted transmissions. we limit access to personal information to those persons in our organization who have a business need to process such personal information. additionally, swrve requires any sub-processers that it may use to adhere to the foregoing security measures.
unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  although we will do our best to protect your personal information, any transmission is at your own risk and we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site.  if you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting by any means set out in the how can i contact swrve? section below.
