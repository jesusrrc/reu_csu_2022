cavli sees and logs non-personally identifiable data when you use cavli services. cavli logs                            this data in our system and stores it on third-party servers. the only identifiable                            information this data is connected to will be the account details you supplied when creating                            your account.
treatment of information we collect
when you create an account with cavli, you provide us with data that includes an email                            address and password. cavli may also give you the option to voluntarily share other data                            with us that is connected to your account. if any of these details change, you may update                            your account at any time and modify, correct or delete your account details.
if you are using cavli to connect a product to the cavli cloud, you will be required to                            identify a network and corresponding network password. this information exists only locally,                            and cavli does not have access to it. when you connect a product, a specific product id will                            be sent to the cavli cloud, after which cavli will be able to match a specific device id to                            your account details.
