cookies
we use so-called cookies in some areas of our website. such file elements allow your computer to be identified as a technical unit during your visit to this website in order to facilitate your use of our services - even during repeated visits.
as a rule, however, you have the option of setting your internet browser so that you are informed about the use of cookies and can either accept or exclude them or delete existing cookies.
please use the help function of your internet browser to obtain information on how to change these settings. please note that some features of our website may not work if you have disabled the use of cookies.
cookies do not allow a server to read private data from your computer or data stored by another server. they do no damage to your computer and contain no viruses.
the use of cookies is based on art. 6 par. 1 letter f) gdpr: the processing is carried out to improve the functioning of our website. it is therefore necessary to protect our legitimate interests.
use of analysis tool "matomo" (previously known as "piwik")
our website uses matomo (https://matomo.org/), an open-source software to analyze visitor access to our website. matomo uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. the information generated by the cookie about the use of this website is stored on our servers in germany and not passed on to third parties. your ip address will be anonymized immediately after processing and before it is stored.
you may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our website.
you can also object to the use of your data by matomo by making use of the following option:
a cookie is stored on your browser, which only contains the information that no data may be collected about you by matomo. previously stored cookies are then deleted. however, should you delete all cookies in your browser, you may have to object to the use of your data again.
you can decide here whether a unique web analysis cookie may be stored in your browser to enable us to collect and analyze various statistical data. if you choose not to, you can place the matomo deactivation cookie in your browser by clicking on the following link.
the use of the aforementioned analysis tool is based on art. 6 para. 1 letter f) gdpr: the processing takes place for the analysis of the usage behavior and is therefore necessary to protect our legitimate interests.
pardot
our us website also uses pardot, a service of salesforce.com inc., the landmark @ one market street, san francisco, ca 94105, usa. pardot sets a maximum of three cookies. these are text files that are stored on your computer and allow an analysis of the use of the website. the cookies set are a "visitor cookie", an "opt-in cookie" and a "pardot app session cookie". an identification number is generated via the "visitor cookie", which is used to recognize the visitor's browser. the identification number is a generated numerical code that has no meaning outside of pardot services. the "opt-in cookie" ensures that no "visitor cookie" is set by those visitors who have chosen the "do not track" setting in their browser. the "pardot app session cookie" is only set if a customer logs into the pardot app as user. all cookies only receive the generated number code. personal data is not collected in this respect. if you want to prevent tracking by pardot, you can ensure this by your browser settings, or by a corresponding extension of your browser.
user local
our website for the japanese market uses user insight, an access analytical tool provided by user local, inc. (4th floor, 2-11-1 osaki, shinagawa-ku, tokyo 141-0032, japan) to monitor the site and in turn improve our services. to do so, a cookie containing a time stamp may be placed in your web browser. we also send access information (web address, user agent, etc.) to user local's server in japan and use this information for the sole purpose of analyzing how our site is used and improving your user experience. the collected data is managed in accordance with the privacy policy of user local inc., which you can check at https://info.userlocal.jp/data_policy/.
recaptcha
for your protection we use the service invisible recaptcha of the company google inc., 1600 amphitheatre parkway, mountain view, ca 94043, united states ("google"). the query serves to differentiate whether the input is made by a person or abusively by automated machine processing. the query includes sending the ip address and any other data required by google for the recaptcha service to google. for this purpose your input will be transmitted to google and used there.
however, if ip anonymization is activated on this website, google will reduce your ip address within member states of the european union or in other countries party to the agreement on the european economic area beforehand. only in exceptional cases will the full ip address be transmitted to a google server in the usa and shortened there. on our behalf, google will use this information to evaluate your use of this service. the ip address transmitted by your browser within the scope of recaptcha is not merged with other google data.
the deviating data protection regulations of the company google apply to this data. for more information about google's privacy policy, please visit: https://policies.google.com/privacy.
we would like to point out that ip anonymization is active on this site in order to guarantee anonymous collection of ip addresses (so-called ip masking).
the use of invisible recaptcha is based on art. 6 para. 1 letter a) gdpr. with confirmation of the inquiry you give us your consent to data processing. in any case, data processing is permissible pursuant to art. 6 para. 1 letter f) gdpr; the query serves to protect access and is intended to ensure human action. it is therefore in our legitimate interest.
url shorteners
to provide hyperlinks (including external links), we use url shortening services provided by bitly, inc., 139 5th avenue, 5th floor, new york, ny 10010, united states, and yourls (https://yourls.org/). the legal basis for this is our legitimate interest in the economical operation of our online services in acc. with art. 6 para. 1 letter f) gdpr. we use bitly for the anonymous performance monitoring of these links. when you click a bitly link, your query is first sent to and stored by a bitly server, before being passed on to the target url. bitly uses cookies to track the origin of the clicks for bitly links. bitly can, for instance track which bitly links a user has clicked. bitly, inc. is part of the eu-us privacy shield and the swiss-us privacy shield. you can find the privacy policy of bitly at https://bitly.com/pages/privacy.
yourls also enables the use of shortened links, but is not hosted by an external provider. in this case, the monitoring and statistical analysis of the links are processed by us.
flipping books
we use the tool joomag of joomag, inc. 75 e. santa clara st., floor 6, san jose, ca 95113, united states, to produce flipping books. when using these books, some usage data and browser parameters are transferred to joomag. you can find the privacy policy of joomag at https://www.joomag.com/en/privacy.
the legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is art. 6 para. 1 letter f) gdpr.
google search console
we use the google search console service provided by google inc,. 1600 amphitheatre parkway, mountain view, ca 94043, united states, to analyze the use of our website and improve its usability.
when a google service is used, the data for this service is not collected by us or in our responsibility, but directly by google.
as proprietor of the domains, google provides us with access to the analyses and evaluation of the google data. as part of this, we only have access to data relating to our domains.
the privacy policy of google applies to this data, which you can find at: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en.
social media
we currently use the following social media plug-ins: facebook, twitter, linkedin (including slideshare), flickr, and youtube. we use the so-called shariff solution. this means that when you visit our website, no personal data is initially passed on to the providers of the plug-ins. you can recognize the provider of the plug-in by the marking on the box above its initial letter or the logo. we offer you the possibility to communicate directly with the provider of the plug-in via the button. only if you click on the marked field and thereby activate it, the plug-in provider receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding website of our online offer. in addition, the data specified in section 2 of this policy will be transmitted. in the case of facebook, according to the provider, the ip address is anonymized in germany immediately after collection. by activating the plug-in, personal data is transferred from you to the respective plug-in provider and stored there (for us providers in the usa). since the plug-in provider collects data mainly via cookies, we recommend that you delete all cookies before clicking on the grayed-out box using your browser's security settings.
we have no influence on the data collected and data processing processes, nor are we aware of the full extent of data collection, the purposes of processing, the storage periods. we also have no information on the deletion of the data collected by the plug-in provider.
the plug-in provider stores the data collected about you as user profiles and uses these for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. such an evaluation takes place in particular (also for users who are not logged in) for the representation of demand-fair advertisement and in order to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. you have a right of objection to the creation of these user profiles, for which you must contact the respective plug-in provider to exercise this right. through the plug-ins we offer you the possibility to interact with social networks and other users, so that we can improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. the legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is art. 6 para. 1 letter f) gdpr.
the data is transferred regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in there. if you are logged in with the plug-in provider, your data collected with us will be directly assigned to your existing account with the plug-in provider. if you click the activated button and, for example, link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. we recommend that you log out regularly after using a social network, especially before activating the button, as this way you can avoid being assigned to your profile with the plug-in provider.
for more information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider, please refer to the data protection declarations of these providers as notified below. they will also provide you with further information about your rights in this regard and setting options to protect your privacy.
the data provided to us by social media providers are processed by us by means of the social media management software “hootsuite”. we have a legitimate interest in using the software in accordance with art. 6 para. 1 letter f) gdpr.
hootsuite enables us to manage several social media accounts. posts can be prepared, planned, published, liked, and shared, and the channels of different providers can be monitored within hootsuite to pinpoint relevant discussions in the social web concerning our company, brands, products and services.
we have only limited access to your user data. the user data primarily includes your publically accessible profile data (cf. 3. personal data). we have no complete knowledge of the extent to which hootsuite collects your user data.
for more information about the privacy policy of hootsuite see: https://hootsuite.com/legal/privacy.
