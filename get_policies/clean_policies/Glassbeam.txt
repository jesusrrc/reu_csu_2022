your rights and choices the ccpa provides consumers (california residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. this section describes your ccpa rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
access to specific information and data portability rights you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose the same to you.
deletion request rights you have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
exercising access, data portability, and deletion rights to exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us per the contact information described below.
only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. you may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. you may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. the verifiable consumer request must:
provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
we cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. we will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
response timing we endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. if we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. if you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. if you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. the response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. for data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
we do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. if we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
how to opt out of data collection if you have questions or concerns, or would like to exercise your rights related to your personal data, you should contact us immediately via telephone at 408-740-4600 or send us an email to info@glassbeam.com.
