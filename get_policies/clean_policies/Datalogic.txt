1. data controller
the holder of the processing carried out through the site is datalogic as defined above. for any information concerning the processing of personal data by datalogic, including the list of data processors who process data, you can write to the following address: marketing@datalogic.com
2. the personal data subject to processing
following the navigation of the site, we inform you that datalogic will process personal data that may consist of an identifier such as the name, an identification number, an online id or one or more elements characteristic of your physical, physiological, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity suitable to make the interested party identified or identifiable (hereafter only "personal data ").
the personal data processed through the site are as follows:
a. navigation data
during their normal operation, the computer systems and software procedures used to operate this site acquire certain personal data whose transmission is implicit in the use of internet communication protocols. this information is not collected with the intention of linking it to an identifiable user, but, by its own very nature, could lead to the identification of users by processing it in association with data held by third parties. this category of data includes ip addresses or domain names of computers used by persons who connect to the site, the uri (uniform resource identifier) of requested resources, the time of request, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file received in reply, the numerical code indicating the status of the reply given by the server (successful, error, etc.) and other parameters regarding the user's operating system and computer environment. these data are only used to obtain anonymous statistical information about website usage and to check its correct functioning; they are deleted immediately after processing. the data could be used to ascertain responsibility in case of hypothetical computer crimes against the website: currently, except for this possibility, data concerning web contacts are not kept for more than seven days.
b. special categories of personal data

c. data provided voluntarily by the interested party

d. cookies
definitions, characteristics and application of the legislation
cookies are small text files that the sites visited by the user send and record on their personal computer or any other device, even mobile, to then be re-transmitted to the same sites at the next visit. thanks to cookies, a site remembers the user's actions and preferences (such as login data, the chosen language, font size, other display settings, etc.) so that they do not have to be re-indicated when the user returns to visit said site or browse from one page to another. cookies, therefore, are used to perform computer authentication, monitoring sessions and storing information regarding the activities of users accessing a site, and may also contain a unique identification code that allows for tracking the user's navigation within the site itself for statistical or advertising purposes. during navigation on a site, the user can also receive, on his/her computer or mobile device, cookies from websites or web servers other than the one he/she is visiting (so-called "third-party" cookies). some operations may not be able to be performed without the use of cookies, which in some cases are therefore technically necessary for the functioning of said site.
there are various types of cookies, depending on their characteristics and functions, and these can remain in the user's computer or mobile device for different periods of time: so-called session cookies, which are automatically deleted when the browser is closed; so-called persistent cookies, which remain on the user's equipment until a predetermined deadline.
according to the legislation in force in italy, the user's express consent is not always required for the use of cookies. in particular, "technical cookies", namely those used for the sole purpose of transmitting a communication over an electronic communications network, or to the extent strictly necessary to provide a service explicitly requested by the user, do not require such consent. in other words, these are cookies that are essential for the operation of the site or are necessary to perform activities requested by the user.
among the technical cookies, which do not require express consent for their use, the italian data protection authority (see provision identification of the simplified procedures for the information and the acquisition of consent for the use of cookies 8 may 2014 and subsequent clarifications, hereafter only "provision") also includes:
"analytics cookies" where used directly by the site operator to collect information, in aggregate form, on the number of users and how they visit the site,
browsing or session cookies (to authenticate the user),
functional cookies, that allow the user to browse based on a set of selected criteria (for example, the language, the products selected for purchase) in order to improve the service provided to the user.
for "profiling cookies", on the other hand, namely those aimed at creating profiles related to the user and used to send advertising messages in line with the preferences expressed by the same in the context of surfing the net, a prior consent of the user is required.
types of cookies used by the site and the possibility of (de)selection
the site uses the following cookies that can be deselected, except for third-party cookies for which they must refer directly to the relative methods of selection and deselection of the respective cookies, indicated by means of links:
technical cookies for navigation or session and which are strictly necessary for the operation of the site or to allow it to use the content and services requested.
functionality cookies, used to activate specific functions of the site and a series of selected criteria (for example, the language, the products selected for purchase) in order to improve the service provided.
attention: by disabling technical and/or functional cookies, the site may not be available or certain services or certain functions of the site may be unavailable or may not work properly, and the user may be forced to change or manually enter certain information or preferences every time they visit the site.
third-party cookies, ie cookies of sites or web servers other than those of datalogic, used for the purposes of these third parties. it should be noted that these third parties, listed below with the related links to privacy policies, are typically independent data controllers collected through the cookies they serve; therefore, the user must refer to their policies regarding the processing of personal data, information and consent forms (selection and deselection of the respective cookies), as specified in the aforementioned provision. for completeness, please note that datalogic does its utmost to track cookies on its site. these are updated regularly in the table below, where we give transparency on the cookies directly sent by datalogic and their purpose.regarding the third parties that send cookies through our site, we provide below the links to the respective privacy policies: to these third parties we demand, as already specified, the responsibility to provide the information and collect your consent, as provided by the provision. this responsibility is to be referred not only to cookies that third parties send directly, but also to any additional cookies that are sent via our site by virtue of the use of services that the third parties themselves enjoy. in fact, with respect to these cookies, sent by service providers of the aforementioned third parties, datalogic does not have the possibility to exercise any control and does not know its characteristics or purposes.
