1. scope
this privacy policy applies to the personally identifiable information or personal information (separately and together, personal information) collected by veridify security inc (veridify) off-line and on-line through the veridify website and through interactive features, applications, widgets, blogs, social networks, and on-line or wireless offerings that refer to this policy, whether accessed through a computer, mobile device, or other technology.
review this policy and the terms as applicable to your interaction with veridify. a third-party website linked to and/or from a veridify website or application or other means may have different policies; as a result of the foregoing, review the applicable privacy policy for that website. this policy does not cover the use of personal information directly obtained by a third party from you; use of such personal information is covered by the relevant party's privacy policy, not this privacy policy.
2. collection of information
a. information provided
in general. while veridify does not generally require the provision of personal information to visit and use a veridify website or to participate in certain veridify website and application activities, such as sweepstakes, contests and other promotions (collectively, promotions) and blogs, chat rooms, veridify may ask you to provide personal information through its website or its applications that could reasonably be used to contact you, provide the services contemplated by the website or application, or to identify you personally (such as first and last name, e-mail address, mailing address and telephone number). veridify may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (such as gender, geographic region, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests. if you choose not to provide such personal information or other information, you may not be able to participate in certain activities offered by veridify. if veridify combines demographic or other information veridify collects about you with your personal information, veridify intends to treat the combined information as personal information.
individuals under 13. a veridify website is open to all individuals, though some promotions may have age restrictions. veridify does not knowingly collect or permit the collection, storage or use of any personal information from anyone under 13. if you are a parent or guardian who knows or has discovered that your child under the age of 13 has submitted his or her personal information or other information without your consent, permission or authorization, veridify will promptly, upon request: (a) provide direct notice to you indicating what, if any, personal information of your child has been collected and how it has been used and/or disclosed; (b) remove your child's personal information or other information from the production database, cease the use of such information and direct any other party with access to such information to do the same; and (c) by notice to you, confirm compliance with the foregoing.
for promotions. veridify may offer opportunities to enter into promotions, on its own or jointly with or on behalf of a third party. such promotions may require registration and the disclosure of both personal information and non-personal information. in the event that a promotion is offered jointly or on behalf of with a third party, as a result of your participation in such promotion, your personal information and non-personal information may be shared with such third party, which sharing veridify will disclose to you at the time you provide your information. by entering a promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, which may contain specific requirements, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other third parties connected to the promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising and marketing materials. therefore, read the rules of the promotion before entering.
b. information automatically collected
in addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to provide to veridify via a veridify website or application, whenever you visit or interact with veridify, veridify directly or through a third-party analytics provider may automatically collect certain information such as your ip address and/or another unique identifier ("device identifier") for the computer, mobile device, or other device ("device") you use. (a device identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your device when you access a website or its servers through other means. veridify computers identify your device by its device identifier.) some mobile service providers may also provide veridify or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access a veridify website or data repository that stores such information.
veridify, as well as certain third-party analytics and other service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how you use a veridify website or other application ("usage information"). usage information may include, in part, the application used to interact with veridify, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time at which a page was accessed and/or the time spent on a page, and the preceding pages views. usage information is generally non-identifying, but if veridify associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, veridify intends to treat it as personal information.
c. tracking technologies: cookies; and other tracking technologies
the technologies such as a veridify application and/or a veridify website used to collect usage information, including device identifiers, may include:
cookies. "cookies" (which may be html files, flash files or other technology) are small text files that help store user preferences and activity. a cookie is placed on a device when it is used to visit the veridify websites or otherwise access our online offerings. cookies may be used for many purposes, such as remembering you and your preferences, tracking your visits to our web pages and customizing your veridify website experience. if you choose to disable cookies on your device, some features of our websites or our online offerings may not function properly.
