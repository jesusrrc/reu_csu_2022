gurus solutions privacy statement and policy
gurus solutions privacy policy

updated as of: may 13th, 2021
gurus solutions inc. and its affiliates (collectively referred to in this document as “gurus”, “we”, “us” or other similar expressions) are committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who visit and interact with their websites (which we refer to as “visitors” in this document), the persons who are recipients of the services, as this term is defined below (which we refer to as “customers” in this document), as well as the persons who use or disclose personal information (which we refer to as “users” in this document) in connection with the registration for, and the use of, our software products, such as the netsuite data exporter software (collectively, the “software”). this privacy policy (in short, the “policy”) describes gurus’ privacy practices in relation to the use of its websites and its software, the performance or delivery of services to customers and other interactions with people that are not visitors, customers or users.
scope of this policy
this policy applies to the information we obtain or collect through our performance or delivery of services to our customers, through our websites, when users download, use and/or access the software or when people otherwise interact or communicate with us directly.
by visiting and interacting with the gurus websites, by receiving the services or by registering or using the software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this policy, and you consent to our collection, storage, use, processing and disclosure of your personal information as set out in this policy now, and as amended by us. this policy is incorporated into, and considered a part of, gurus’ end user license agreement (the “eula”) for the software, located at https://gurussolutions.com/gurus-solutions-data-exporter-tool-for-netsuite-terms-of-use
we may change this policy from time to time at our discretion and when doing so, we will change the “updated as of” date above. we will notify you of any changes to this policy by posting the revised policy on our website or by seeking your consent, depending on the nature and materiality of the change. you are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. your continued use of the gurus websites, the services and the software after any change to this policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
by downloading, using and/or accessing the software, you understand and agree that we are providing a google® sheet add-on, which enables users to extract data from netsuite® and import it into google® sheets, thus allowing them to use netsuite® data outside of the application itself.
the data a user can extract using the software (the “extracted data”) depends on the access permissions the user possesses in netsuite®; while a user cannot extract more than she/he can access in netsuite®, it means that the user can extract anything she/he has access to.
it also means that once the extracted data has been imported in a google® sheet document, such data is not bound to the access rules set in netsuite® because the user is then free to share it with other people, print it, download it, etc.
the software does not provide us any means to access or see your extracted data.
here are some definitions of terms used throughout this policy:
the “gurus websites” include our websites, such as gurussolutions.com (including the related sub-domains and pages).
the “services” are the professional services we provide to our customers.
a “device” is any computer used to access the gurus websites or the software, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, smartphone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device.
1. information we collect
we may collect the following types of information in connection with your use of the gurus websites, your interactions with us offline such as through our performance of services for a customer or other various communications of a commercial nature such as newsletters, announcements and the like, as well as your registration for, and use of, the software.
1.1. non-personal information and personal information
non-personal information is information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to you, such as, without limitation, device information, data collected through automated electronic interactions, application usage data, demographic information, geographic or geo-location information, and statistical and aggregated information. we may use non-personal information to create aggregate tracking information reports regarding user demographics. none of the tracking information in the reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users. we also may link tracking information with users’ personal information, but once such a link is made, all of the linked information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only in accordance with this policy, and in accordance with the law. you may choose whether or not you want us to use tracking technologies to remember you.
personal information is information that identifies an individual, relates to an identifiable individual or allows an individual to be identified (“personal information”). examples of personal information include information provided by:	 a customer representative about herself, including her name, e-mail and physical address, telephone number, billing information, company affiliation and associated interests;an employee at a prospect customer about herself including her name, e-mail and physical address, telephone number, billing information, company affiliation and associated interests; an applicant for an open employment position, which would include e-mail and physical address, telephone number, presentation letter and cv content, internal notes and analysis on the applicant; ora user upon registration for the software, including her first and last name, title (if applicable), telephone number, e-mail address and the name of the company with which she is affiliated (through employment or otherwise) as well as any other contact information provided upon registration for the software (“contact information”). note that we do not collect or otherwise have access to your netsuite® password.

1.2 how gurus collects personal information
gurus and our third party service providers may collect personal information and other information directly from you from a variety of sources that generally fall into the following categories:
direct interactions: from your use of, and interaction with us through, the gurus websites, the software and other activities such as submission of registrations and forms, or sales inquiries and transactions as well as in-person meetings in trade shows or other similar events. gurus may also collect other information about the customer and some employees, for example through the gurus websites, as part of that interaction;
publicly available data/data from third parties: other data you may have made publicly available, such as social media posts or data provided by third party sources, such as marketing opt-in lists, or data aggregators.
automated interactions with devices: from the use of technologies such as electronic communication protocols, cookies, embedded urls or pixels, or widgets, buttons and tools. although gurus’ use of automated interactions may change over time as technology evolves, the following descriptions are designed to provide you with additional detail about gurus’ current approach to information collected from automated interactions:	 electronic communications protocols: as is the case when you visit most websites and use most apps, gurus may automatically receive information from you as part of the communication connection itself, which often consists of network routing information (where you came from), equipment information (browser type), your ip address (which may identify your general geographic location or company), and date and time.		gurus may also automatically receive and record information about your interaction with the gurus websites or the software, such as clickstream information (when each gurus webpage was visited and how much time was spent on the page), or general geo-location data.cookies: gurus’ servers will query your browser to see if there are “cookies” previously set by the gurus websites. a cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server to store on a web browser so it can later be read back from that browser. cookies may collect information, including a unique identifier, user preferences, profile information, membership information, and general usage and volume statistical information. cookies may also be used to collect individualized website use data, provide electronic website personalization, or conduct and measure the effectiveness of advertising in accordance with this policy. some cookies may remain on users’ computers after they leave the gurus websites. while the majority are set to expire within 1-24 months of your last visit to the website that set the cookie, others may not expire because of their nature, like cookies that remember opt-out preferences.		your browser may provide you with information and control over cookies. you can set your browser to alert you when a cookie is being used, and accept or reject the cookie. you can also set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers. users can generally disable the cookie feature on their browser without affecting their ability to use the site, except in some cases where cookies are used as an essential security feature necessary for transaction completion. cookies, however, are important to the proper functioning of a site, and disabling them may degrade your experience and interfere with website features and customizations.embedded pixels and similar technologies: on the gurus websites, gurus and its service providers may use embedded pixel technologies for the purposes of identifying unique user visits (as opposed to aggregate hits), and for advertising purposes. in addition, embedded pixels or other technologies may be used in e-mails and our online display advertising to provide information on when the e-mail or ad was opened to track marketing campaign responsiveness; information collected using these technologies may be associated with the recipient’s e-mail address.widgets, buttons, and tools: the gurus websites may include widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g., links to bookmarked sites), along with buttons or other tools that link to other companies’ services (e.g., a “like” button or third party map). the widget, button or tool may collect and automatically send personal information, such as your e-mail address, or other information (such as your browser information, or ip address), to a third party. cookies may also be set or used by the widgets, buttons or tools to enable them to function properly or for other purposes, which may include advertising. information collected or used by a widget, button or tool, including cookie settings and preferences, is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.physical location: we may collect the physical location of your device and use it to provide you with personalized location-based services or content. in some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such use of your device’s location, but if you choose to deny such use, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services or content.
electronic communications protocols: as is the case when you visit most websites and use most apps, gurus may automatically receive information from you as part of the communication connection itself, which often consists of network routing information (where you came from), equipment information (browser type), your ip address (which may identify your general geographic location or company), and date and time.		gurus may also automatically receive and record information about your interaction with the gurus websites or the software, such as clickstream information (when each gurus webpage was visited and how much time was spent on the page), or general geo-location data.

embedded pixels and similar technologies: on the gurus websites, gurus and its service providers may use embedded pixel technologies for the purposes of identifying unique user visits (as opposed to aggregate hits), and for advertising purposes. in addition, embedded pixels or other technologies may be used in e-mails and our online display advertising to provide information on when the e-mail or ad was opened to track marketing campaign responsiveness; information collected using these technologies may be associated with the recipient’s e-mail address.
widgets, buttons, and tools: the gurus websites may include widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g., links to bookmarked sites), along with buttons or other tools that link to other companies’ services (e.g., a “like” button or third party map). the widget, button or tool may collect and automatically send personal information, such as your e-mail address, or other information (such as your browser information, or ip address), to a third party. cookies may also be set or used by the widgets, buttons or tools to enable them to function properly or for other purposes, which may include advertising. information collected or used by a widget, button or tool, including cookie settings and preferences, is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.
physical location: we may collect the physical location of your device and use it to provide you with personalized location-based services or content. in some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such use of your device’s location, but if you choose to deny such use, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services or content.
1.3. google® user data
gurus does not collect, store or share google® user data through the downloading or use of the software by its users. however, the software requires google® authentication to access spreadsheets and the external connection application programming interface (api) and to store the netsuite® credentials (including the netsuite® username, role id and account number, but not the netsuite® password) when the “remember me” box is checked. the term “google® user data” refers to any data that the user creates or owns and/or that concerns the user, which is stored in any google® applications.
2. how we use your information

comply with legal requirements and corporate transactions. gurus may disclose your personal information as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), we may transfer the personal information we have collected to the relevant third party.
some of the personal information uses specified above are not mandatory and may be controlled by you. please refer to the “your choices about your information” section below for information on available use preferences or opt-out options, or view the summary of your privacy choices.
since gurus operates in multiple jurisdictions, we may exchange information internally between our offices and remote worksites. the personal information that you have provided to us may therefore be transferred outside the jurisdiction where you reside. also, in certain countries our third party contractors (such as online application providers) might undertake the collection, transferring, storage and processing of your information on our behalf and control. such collection, transfer, storage and processing of information will be done in accordance with the terms and conditions of this policy.
