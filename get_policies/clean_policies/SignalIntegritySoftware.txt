non-personal information. we may collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when you visit the website or use our products. aggregate and non-personal information does not relate to a single, identifiable visitor. it tells us such things as how many users viewed our website and the pages of the website that were accessed. by collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website and products to the needs of our visitors and users.
most of the information we collect is necessary to provide you with access to this website and our products. for example, if you request technical support, we need to collect your name and email address to be able to respond to your request. see the “opt-out” section below regarding optional information collection.

these third parties are primarily located in the u.s. but may be located throughout the world. in addition, we may disclose personal information about you if we are required to do so by law or pursuant to legal process, in order to respond to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, and/or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. we also reserve the right to transfer any personal information we have about you in the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.
