transfers of your personal data to locations outside the united kingdom/the european economic area
our sharing of your personal data with the third parties identified above will result in the transfer of your personal data to locations outside of the uk or the european economic area (“eea”), which may have data protection rules that are different from those in the uk or the eea (as applicable).  whenever we transfer your personal data out of the uk or the eea, we ensure at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
we transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed by the uk government or the european commission (as applicable) to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data. this applies in respect of any transfer of your personal data (i) from the uk to the eea and (ii) from the eea to certain approved non-eea countries.
for transfers from the uk or the eea to countries not considered adequate (such as when we share personal data with third parties), we rely on adequate measures, such as standard contractual clauses, which give personal data the same protection it has in the uk and the eea. you may obtain a copy of these measures by using the information in the “our contact details” section below.
security
we strive to keep your information as secure as possible.  in order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. measures we take include placing confidentiality requirements on our staff members and service providers and destroying or permanently anonymising personal information if it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected.  as the security of information depends in part on the security of the computer you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect any usernames and passwords necessary to make use of our website, please take appropriate measures to protect this information.
storing your personal information
we will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this privacy policy.  in some circumstances we store your personal information for longer periods of time according to the following criteria:
while we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide our services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using our services);
where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting requirements (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); and
where we need to have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal information or dealings (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
your legal rights
under certain circumstances and subject to certain exemptions, you have rights under data protection laws, to request to access, update, correct, suppress, restrict or delete your personal data provided to us, object to the processing of your personal data (for example, you may object to our use of your information for direct marketing purposes), or request to receive an electronic copy of your personal data for purposes of transmitting it to another company (where the right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law).
we may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, before responding to a request you raise.  we reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, for instance if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
