this pri­va­cy pol­i­cy describes how and when sirqul col­lects, uses and shares your infor­ma­tion when you use our ser­vices. sirqul receives your infor­ma­tion through our var­i­ous web­sites, sms, apis, email noti­fi­ca­tions, appli­ca­tions, but­tons, wid­gets, ads, and com­merce ser­vices (the “ser­vices” or “sirqul”) and from our part­ners and oth­er third par­ties. for exam­ple, you send us infor­ma­tion when you use sirqul from our web­site or access sirqul from any sirqul pow­ered appli­ca­tion. when using any of our ser­vices you con­sent to the col­lec­tion, trans­fer, manip­u­la­tion, stor­age, dis­clo­sure and oth­er uses of your infor­ma­tion as described in this pri­va­cy pol­i­cy. irre­spec­tive of which coun­try you reside in or sup­ply infor­ma­tion from, you autho­rize sirqul to use your infor­ma­tion in the unit­ed states and any oth­er coun­try where sirqul oper­ates.
if you have any ques­tions or com­ments about this pri­va­cy pol­i­cy, please con­tact us at privacy@sirqul.com.
information collection and use
sirqul col­lects and uses your infor­ma­tion below to provide our ser­vices and to mea­sure and improve them over time.
basic account infor­ma­tion: when you cre­ate or recon­fig­ure a sirqul account, you provide some per­son­al infor­ma­tion, such as your name, user­name, pass­word, and email address. in some cas­es, you may be required to provide your phone num­ber, for exam­ple, to use sirqul via sms or to help us pre­vent spam, fraud, or abuse. your name and user­name are dis­played pub­licly on our ser­vices, includ­ing on your pro­file page and in search results. some ser­vices, such as search and pub­lic user pro­files, do not require reg­is­tra­tion.
addi­tion­al infor­ma­tion: you may provide us with pro­file infor­ma­tion to make pub­lic, such as a short biog­ra­phy, your loca­tion, your web­site, or a pic­ture. you may provide infor­ma­tion to cus­tomize your account, such as a nick­name. we may use your con­tact infor­ma­tion to send you infor­ma­tion about our ser­vices or to mar­ket to you. you may use your account set­tings to unsub­scribe from noti­fi­ca­tions from sirqul. you may also unsub­scribe by fol­low­ing the instruc­tions con­tained with­in the noti­fi­ca­tion or the instruc­tions on our web­site. we may use your con­tact infor­ma­tion to help oth­ers find your sirqul account, includ­ing through third-par­ty ser­vices and client appli­ca­tions. your pri­va­cy set­tings con­trol whether oth­ers can find you by your email address or nick­name. you may choose to upload your address book so that we can help you find sirqul users you know or help oth­er sirqul users find you. we may lat­er make sug­ges­tions to you and oth­er users on sirqul based on import­ed address book con­tacts. you can delete your import­ed address book con­tacts from sirqul at any time. if you email us, we may keep your mes­sage, email address and con­tact infor­ma­tion to respond to your request. if you con­nect your sirqul account to your account on anoth­er ser­vice, the oth­er ser­vice may send us your reg­is­tra­tion or pro­file infor­ma­tion on that ser­vice and oth­er infor­ma­tion that you autho­rize. this infor­ma­tion helps us improve the ser­vices, and is delet­ed from sirqul with­in a few weeks of your dis­con­nect­ing from sirqul your account on the oth­er ser­vice. pro­vid­ing the addi­tion­al infor­ma­tion described in this sec­tion is entire­ly option­al.
actions, fol­low­ing, lists and oth­er pub­lic infor­ma­tion: our ser­vices are pri­mar­i­ly designed to help you cre­ate, share, and inter­act with the world. most of the infor­ma­tion you provide us is infor­ma­tion you are ask­ing us to make pub­lic. this includes not only the inter­ac­tions you have with our ser­vice and the meta­data pro­vid­ed when you cre­ate con­tent, but the peo­ple you fol­low, the content/people you mark as favorites, and many oth­er bits of infor­ma­tion that result from your use of the ser­vices. we may use this infor­ma­tion to cus­tomize the con­tent we show you, includ­ing ads. our default is almost always to make the infor­ma­tion you provide pub­lic for as long as you do not delete it from sirqul, but we gen­er­al­ly give you set­tings to make the infor­ma­tion more pri­vate if you want. our ser­vices broad­ly and instant­ly dis­sem­i­nate your pub­lic infor­ma­tion to a wide range of users, cus­tomers, and ser­vices. for instance, your pub­lic user pro­file infor­ma­tion and pub­licly post­ed con­tent are imme­di­ate­ly deliv­ered via our apis to our part­ners and oth­er third par­ties, includ­ing search engi­nes, devel­op­ers, and pub­lish­ers that inte­grate sirqul con­tent into their ser­vices. when you share infor­ma­tion or con­tent like com­ments, pho­tos, videos, and links via the ser­vices, you should think care­ful­ly about what you are mak­ing pub­lic.
loca­tion infor­ma­tion: you may choose to pub­lish your loca­tion via your sirqul pro­file set­tings. you may also tell us your loca­tion when you set your com­put­er or mobile device to send us loca­tion infor­ma­tion. we may also use oth­er data from your device to deter­mine loca­tion, for exam­ple, infor­ma­tion about wire­less net­works or cell tow­ers near your mobile device, or your ip address. we may use and store infor­ma­tion about your loca­tion to provide fea­tures of our ser­vices and to improve and cus­tomize the ser­vices, for exam­ple, with more rel­e­vant con­tent like local infor­ma­tion, shops, sim­i­lar­ly inter­est­ed users, ads, and sug­ges­tions.
links: sirqul may keep track of how you inter­act with links across our ser­vices, includ­ing our email noti­fi­ca­tions, third-par­ty ser­vices, and client appli­ca­tions, by redi­rect­ing clicks or through oth­er means. we do this to help improve our ser­vices, to provide more rel­e­vant adver­tis­ing, and to be able to share aggre­gate click sta­tis­tics such as how many times a par­tic­u­lar con­tent source, link, etc. was clicked on, read, or shared.
cook­ies: like many web­sites, we use cook­ies and sim­i­lar tech­nolo­gies to col­lect addi­tion­al web­site usage data and to improve our ser­vices, but we do not require cook­ies for many parts of our ser­vices such as search­ing and look­ing at pub­lic user pro­files. a cook­ie is a small data file that is trans­ferred to your computer’s hard disk. sirqul may use both ses­sion cook­ies and per­sis­tent cook­ies to bet­ter under­stand how you inter­act with our ser­vices, to mon­i­tor aggre­gate usage by our users and web traf­fic rout­ing on our ser­vices, and to cus­tomize and improve our ser­vices. most inter­net browsers auto­mat­i­cal­ly accept cook­ies. you can instruct your browser, by chang­ing its set­tings, to stop accept­ing cook­ies or to prompt you before accept­ing a cook­ie from the web­sites you vis­it. how­ev­er, some ser­vices may not func­tion prop­er­ly if you dis­able cook­ies.
log data: when you use our ser­vices, we may receive infor­ma­tion (“log data”) such as your ip address, browser type, oper­at­ing sys­tem, the refer­ring web page, pages vis­it­ed, loca­tion, your mobile car­ri­er, device infor­ma­tion (includ­ing device and appli­ca­tion ids), search terms, and cook­ie infor­ma­tion. we receive log data when you inter­act with our ser­vices, for exam­ple, when you vis­it our web­sites, sign into our ser­vices, inter­act with our email noti­fi­ca­tions, use your sirqul account to authen­ti­cate to a third-par­ty web­site or appli­ca­tion, or vis­it a third-par­ty web­site that includes a sirqul but­ton or wid­get. we may also receive log data when you click on, view or inter­act with a link on our ser­vices to a third-par­ty appli­ca­tion, such as when you choose to install anoth­er appli­ca­tion through sirqul, app stores, or via var­i­ous web­site usage. sirqul uses log data to provide, under­stand, and improve our ser­vices. if not already done ear­lier, for exam­ple, as pro­vid­ed below for wid­get data, we will either delete log data or remove any com­mon account iden­ti­fiers, such as your user­name, full ip address, or email address, after 18 months.
wid­get data: we may tai­lor the ser­vices for you based on your vis­its to third-par­ty web­sites that inte­grate sirqul but­tons or wid­gets. when the­se web­sites first load our but­tons or wid­gets for dis­play, we receive log data that includes the web page you vis­it­ed and a cook­ie that iden­ti­fies your browser (“wid­get data”). after a max­i­mum of 10 days, we start the process of delet­ing, de-iden­ti­fy­ing, or aggre­gat­ing wid­get data, which is usu­al­ly instan­ta­neous but in some cas­es may take up to a week. we may use wid­get data to tai­lor con­tent for you, such as sug­ges­tions for peo­ple to fol­low on sirqul and oth­er con­tent you may be inter­est­ed in. tai­lored con­tent is stored with only browser cook­ies or device ids and is sep­a­rat­ed from oth­er wid­get data such as page-vis­it infor­ma­tion. for posts, log data, and oth­er infor­ma­tion that we receive from inter­ac­tions with sirqul but­tons or wid­gets, please see the oth­er sec­tions of this pri­va­cy pol­i­cy.
com­merce ser­vices: you may provide your pay­ment infor­ma­tion, includ­ing your cred­it or deb­it card num­ber, card expi­ra­tion date, cvv code, and billing address (col­lec­tive­ly, “pay­ment infor­ma­tion”), along with your ship­ping address, to com­plete a com­merce trans­ac­tion on sirqul. you may also provide your cred­it or deb­it card num­ber to reg­is­ter for card-linked ser­vices, such as offers. to facil­i­tate future pur­chas­es on sirqul, we store your pay­ment infor­ma­tion, exclud­ing cvv code, and ship­ping address, which you can remove from your account at any time using your account set­tings. we con­sid­er your pay­ment infor­ma­tion and ship­ping address pri­vate and do not make such infor­ma­tion pub­lic. we col­lect and store infor­ma­tion cre­at­ed by your pur­chas­es made on sirqul (“trans­ac­tion data”). if you reg­is­ter your cred­it or deb­it card with sirqul for card-linked ser­vices, we receive infor­ma­tion about the card trans­ac­tions from a third-par­ty pay­ment ser­vices provider (“reg­is­tered card data”). trans­ac­tion data and reg­is­tered card data may include the merchant’s name and the date, time and amount of the trans­ac­tion. sirqul uses reg­is­tered card data to ver­i­fy eli­gi­bil­i­ty for card-linked ser­vices, and may also use reg­is­tered card data to lim­it the num­ber of offers avail­able to you and keep track of your offers.
third-par­ties and affil­i­ates: sirqul uses a vari­ety of third-par­ty ser­vices to help provide our ser­vices to help us under­stand and improve the use of our ser­vices, such as google ana­lyt­ics. the­se third-par­ty ser­vice providers may col­lect infor­ma­tion sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cook­ies or your ip address. third-par­ty ad part­ners may share infor­ma­tion with us, like a browser cook­ie id, web­site url vis­it­ed, mobile device id, or cryp­to­graph­ic hash of a com­mon account iden­ti­fier (such as an email address), to help us mea­sure and tai­lor ads. for exam­ple, this allows us to dis­play ads about things you may have already shown inter­est in. we may also receive infor­ma­tion about you from our cor­po­rate affil­i­ates in order to help provide, under­stand, and improve our ser­vices and our affil­i­ates’ ser­vices, includ­ing the deliv­ery of ads.
information sharing and disclosure
your con­sent: we may share or dis­close your infor­ma­tion at your direc­tion, such as when you autho­rize a third-par­ty web client or appli­ca­tion to access your sirqul account.
ser­vice providers: we engage ser­vice providers to per­form func­tions and provide ser­vices to us in the unit­ed states and abroad. we may share your pri­vate per­son­al infor­ma­tion with such ser­vice providers sub­ject to con­fi­den­tial­i­ty oblig­a­tions con­sis­tent with this pri­va­cy pol­i­cy, and on the con­di­tion that the third par­ties use your pri­vate per­son­al data only on our behalf and pur­suant to our instruc­tions. we share your pay­ment infor­ma­tion with pay­ment ser­vices providers to process pay­ments; pre­vent, detect and inves­ti­gate fraud or oth­er pro­hib­it­ed activ­i­ties; facil­i­tate dis­pute res­o­lu­tion such as charge­backs or refunds; and for oth­er pur­pos­es asso­ci­at­ed with the accep­tance of cred­it or deb­it cards. we may share your cred­it or deb­it card num­ber with pay­ment ser­vices providers, or third par­ties autho­rized by them, to mon­i­tor card trans­ac­tions at par­tic­i­pat­ing mer­chants and track redemp­tion activ­i­ty for the pur­pos­es of pro­vid­ing card-linked ser­vices.
sell­ers of goods and ser­vices: if you buy goods or ser­vices on sirqul, we may provide the sell­er, com­merce provider or mar­ket­place with your name, email address, ship­ping address, pay­ment infor­ma­tion and trans­ac­tion data to facil­i­tate pay­ment pro­cess­ing, order ful­fill­ment and dis­pute res­o­lu­tion (includ­ing pay­ment and ship­ping dis­putes) and to help pre­vent, detect and inves­ti­gate fraud or oth­er pro­hib­it­ed activ­i­ties. please refer to the­se third par­ties’ pri­va­cy poli­cies for infor­ma­tion about their pri­va­cy prac­tices.
law and harm: notwith­stand­ing any­thing to the con­trary in this pol­i­cy, we may pre­serve or dis­close your infor­ma­tion if we believe that it is rea­son­ably nec­es­sary to com­ply with a law, reg­u­la­tion or legal request; to pro­tect the safe­ty of any per­son; to address fraud, secu­ri­ty or tech­ni­cal issues; or to pro­tect sirqul’s rights or prop­er­ty. how­ev­er, noth­ing in this pri­va­cy pol­i­cy is intend­ed to lim­it any legal defens­es or objec­tions that you may have to a third party’s, includ­ing a government’s, request to dis­close your infor­ma­tion.
busi­ness trans­fers and affil­i­ates: in the event that sirqul is involved in a bank­rupt­cy, merg­er, acqui­si­tion, reor­ga­ni­za­tion or sale of assets, your infor­ma­tion may be sold or trans­ferred as part of that trans­ac­tion. this pri­va­cy pol­i­cy will apply to your infor­ma­tion as trans­ferred to the new enti­ty. we may also dis­close infor­ma­tion about you to our cor­po­rate affil­i­ates in order to help provide, under­stand, and improve our ser­vices and our affil­i­ates’ ser­vices, includ­ing the deliv­ery of ads.
non-pri­vate or non-per­son­al infor­ma­tion: we may share or dis­close your non-pri­vate, aggre­gat­ed or oth­er­wise non-per­son­al infor­ma­tion, such as your pub­lic user pro­file infor­ma­tion, pub­lic con­tent, the peo­ple you fol­low or that fol­low you, or the num­ber of users who clicked on a par­tic­u­lar link (even if only one did), or reports to adver­tis­ers about unique users who saw or clicked on their ads after we have removed any pri­vate per­son­al infor­ma­tion (such as your name or con­tact infor­ma­tion).

about
sirqul™ pro­vides an engage­ment-as-a-ser­vice (eaas) iot plat­form with smart mesh net­work tech­nol­o­gy to dri­ve engage­ment, oper­a­tional effi­cien­cy, rapid inno­va­tion and new rev­enue streams. at the foun­da­tion of sirqul’s plat­form are 400 apis, 80 ser­vices, and 30 indus­try focused, cus­tomiz­able white-label appli­ca­tion tem­plates for rapid­ly deploy­ing iot instances on a scal­able build­ing block plat­form. we are thought lead­ers, engi­neers, cre­ative thinkers and mobile app devel­op­ers with over 23 years of tech exper­tise in device-to-device com­mu­ni­ca­tions, back­end infra­struc­ture and mobile. our mis­sion is to cre­ate a tru­ly dis­rup­tive and viral­ly adopt­ed full stack iot plat­form with no heavy lift­ing — hard­ware, soft­ware and mobile. from the small­est devel­op­ment teams to for­tune 50, inno­v­a­tive orga­ni­za­tions use sirqul to reduce the time from iot inspi­ra­tion – to real­i­ty.
