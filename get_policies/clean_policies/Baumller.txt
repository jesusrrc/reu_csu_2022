the description of the web browser and operating system used, including details of the language used,
the referrer address, which indicates the page from which you reached ours,
the ip address of the requesting terminal device.
your usage data will be stored and analysed in a log for statistical purposes and to improve the quality of our websites as well as to detect, prevent and track attacks.

this enables our websites to check your consent status for all subsequent and future page views and, depending on your decision to use cookies and other technologies, to be able to activate or deactivate them when you return to the site.
the verification is done by comparing the consent key and consent status from the cookies "cookiefirst-id", "cookiefirst-consent" and, if applicable, from the cookie "cf-bulk-consent" with the values provided to digital data solutions bv when you gave your consent to ensure that the status of your original consent has not changed.

2.4. google tag manager
purposes and scope of data processing / legal basis:
on our websites, we integrate the "google tag manager" service of google llc, 1600 amphitheatre parkway, mountain view, california 94043, usa.
in the european union (eu) and the european economic area (eea), google tag manager is offered as a service by google ireland limited, gordon house, barrow street, dublin 4, ireland.
"google tag manager" is a tag management system (tms) that enables us to integrate and manage additional website content in java script or html code.
in particular, so-called tags can be integrated and managed on our website. tags are small code fragments or markers (web beacons, tracking pixels or similar markers) that enable services for website analysis or user tracking to distinguish or identify users.
the analysis of website visits or user tracking is not carried out by the "google tag manager", but by the services used for these purposes, such as "google analytics" or other third-party solutions. rather, the "google tag manager" merely serves to integrate and manage the tags on our websites that are necessary for the analysis or tracking.
since the "google tag manager" is provided by google and is reloaded from its servers when a page is called up, the usage data technically required for calling up the page is also transmitted. google also receives your ip address, which is technically required to retrieve the content.
if we use optional cookies and similar technologies in the context of integrating the service, or if data is stored in or read from your terminal device by the service, this is done in accordance with § 25 abs. 2 ttdsg. subsequent data processing is based on art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f dsgvo. the purpose and our legitimate interest is to efficiently manage our website content.
data processing in third countries:
when using the "google tag manager", your data may also be processed in states outside the european union (eu) and the european economic area (eea) in third countries without an adequate level of data protection, in particular in the usa.
when your data is transferred to third countries, there is a risk that authorities there may access your data for security and monitoring purposes without you being informed or being able to seek legal redress.
to ensure an adequate level of data protection when transferring your data to google llc, 1600 amphitheatre parkway, mountain view, california 94043, usa, standard contractual clauses have been concluded by the european commission in accordance with art. 46 para. 2 lit. c, para. 5 p. 2 dsgvo and further technical measures have been taken. in the future, the clauses will be replaced by standard data protection clauses of the european commission pursuant to art. 46 para. 2 lit. c dsgvo.
recipients / categories of recipients:
we transmit your data within the scope of the use of the "google tag manager" to the following recipients:
google ireland limited, gordon house, barrow street, dublin 4, ireland,
google llc, 1600 amphitheatre parkway, mountain view, california 94043, usa.
we have no influence on any further data processing by the third-party provider.
further information on the handling of personal data by google can be found at https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de.
storage period / criteria for determining the storage period:
by integrating the "google tag manager" on our websites, data is transmitted to the above-mentioned recipients and stored there for as long as is necessary to achieve the aforementioned purpose.
we do not store the collected data separately.
2.5. google analytics
purposes and scope of data processing / legal basis:
on our websites, we integrate the "google analytics" service of google llc, 1600 amphitheatre parkway, mountain view, california 94043, usa.
in the european union (eu) and the european economic area (eea), "google analytics" is offered as a service by google ireland limited, gordon house, barrow street, dublin 4, ireland, which supports us as a processor in accordance with art. 28 dsgvo.
"google analytics" creates usage profiles based on pseudonyms (recognition features from cookie and device id and further data on the end device used or the so-called browser fingerprint) and usage data (e.g. name and address of the website content requested by your browser, referral links, description of the web browser and operating system used as well as the ip address of the requesting end device).
demographic data, such as age, gender and interests of the users, as well as interactions, such as button clicks, scroll depth, as well as the use of filtering and search functions are also collected, analysed and merged with already existing pseudonymous data.
to this end, cookies and similar technologies, in particular javascript, are used to store and read data on your terminal device. details on the cookies and similar techniques used can be found above under "use of cookies and similar techniques".
this enables us to recognise returning visitors, count them as such and assign them to specific demographic target groups or customer segments. we subsequently use these insights to place target group-oriented online advertising measures and marketing campaigns in advertising networks, especially in google advertising services.
with regard to the processing of your ip address, "google analytics" has been configured by us in such a way that it is shortened within the eu by the function "_anonymizeip()" before being transmitted to the google servers in the usa.
if we use optional cookies and similar technologies in the context of integrating the service, or if data is stored in or read from your terminal device by the service, this is done in accordance with § 25 abs. 1 ttdsg. subsequent data processing is based on your consent in accordance with art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a dsgvo, provided you have given your consent via our consent management platform "cookie first".

if an advertisement placed by us via "google ads" is displayed to you on other websites or you click on it, these other websites store a "google ads conversion tracking" cookie with a pseudonym assigned to us in your terminal device on the basis of your consent given there.
if you subsequently visit our websites within the storage period of this cookie, this cookie as well as your usage data will be read by "google ads conversion tracking" by means of a pixel and javascript code on our websites.
this enables google to determine that you have been shown an advertisement placed by us or that you have clicked on it and subsequently visited our websites and, if applicable, how you have subsequently used our websites.
the conversion of an advertisement into an action by the website visitor is known as a conversion.

in particular, google enables us to create target groups for "google ads remarketing" (target group-oriented advertising) on the basis of this data and to address them specifically via google ads advertisements.
if we use optional cookies and similar techniques in the context of integrating the service, or if data is stored in or read from your terminal device by the service, this is done in accordance with § 25 abs. 1 ttdsg. subsequent data processing is based on your consent in accordance with art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a dsgvo, provided you have given your consent via our consent management platform "cookie first".
