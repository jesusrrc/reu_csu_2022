10. other issues
(i) what is the legal basis of processing?
some jurisdictions require an explanation of the legal basis for the collection and processing of personal data. we have several different legal grounds on which we collect and process personal data, including, without limitation: (a) as necessary to perform a transaction (such as in order to provide the products and services you requested); (b) as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as when we use personal data for record keeping to substantiate tax liability); (c) consent (where you have provided consent as appropriate under applicable law, such as for direct marketing or certain cookies); and (d) necessary for legitimate interests (such as when we act to maintain our business generally, including maintaining the safety and security of the site). with respect to legitimate interests, given that we are a b2b company, we typically collect and process limited personal data about customer contacts and other individuals acting in their business capacities, as part of our overall effort to reduce the privacy impact on individuals.
(ii) what are the consequences of not providing personal data?
you are not required to provide all personal data identified in this privacy statement to use our site or to interact with us offline, but certain functionality will not be available if you do not provide certain personal data. if you do not provide certain personal data, we may not be able to respond to your request, perform a transaction with you, or provide you with marketing that we believe you would find valuable.
(iii) do we engage in automated decision-making without human intervention?
we do not use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that produces legal effects concerning you or otherwise significantly affects you.
(iv) does the site honor do not track ("dnt") signals sent via browsers?
given the divergent practices of organizations that offer browsers and the lack of a standard in the marketplace, we do not respond to dnt signals at this time.
(v) how long do we retain personal data?
we typically retain personal data related to marketing activities for as long as you accept marketing communications from us, and upon request we will securely delete such data in accordance with applicable law. for personal data that we collect and process for other purposes described above, we typically retain such personal data for no longer than for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy statement and as otherwise needed to address tax, corporate, compliance, litigation, and other legal rights and obligations.
