third party sites. our products may contain links to third party websites. these linked sites are not under smith micro's control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked site, or any link contained in any linked site. we provide such links only as a convenience, and our inclusion of a link does not imply our endorsement of the linked site. if you provide any personal data through any such third party website, your transaction will occur on such third party's (and not smith micro’s) website, and the personal data you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties. please note that this policy does not address the privacy or information practices of any third parties.

we transfer personal data from the european economic area to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the european commission to have an adequate level of data protection. for example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints. when we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections with respect to your data.
