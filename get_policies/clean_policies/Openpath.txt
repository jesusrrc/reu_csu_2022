how openpath collects and uses account data
openpath collects and processes all account data strictly on behalf of customers and partners in accordance with openpath’s contractual agreements with them and/or as defined in the terms and conditions and/or as required or permitted by law.
customers and partners are responsible for ensuring that account data is obtained and processed in accordance with all applicable laws. since account data is managed by the customer, the customer is responsible for providing appropriate notice and choice regarding openpath’s processing of account data on behalf of the customer. if an individual has any questions or concerns related to openpath’s handling of account data pertaining to them, they may contact our privacy officer via dpo@openpath.com and we will work with the applicable customer to address the concern.
from customers, openpath collects the personal information that is needed to properly manage openpath’s business relationship. customers will receive login credentials to manage their openpath system accounts.

roles of customers, partners, and openpath in protection of account data
openpath provides the openpath system to customers via its partner channel. partners selected by the customer handle the initial setup and configuration of the customer’s openpath account.
customers are responsible for verifying that all individuals who are designated as administrators are authorized by the customer for the levels of access granted. in general, openpath recommends that the customer designate an employee of the customer to be the super admin. if the customer chooses to permit an individual who is not an employee of the customer (such as, for example, an employee of a partner to have any administrative rights or other access or privileges to the customer’s account or account data), the customer is responsible for monitoring the third party’s access to and use of the account and account data. openpath is not responsible for any unauthorized use or misuse of the customer’s account access, account privileges or account data by anyone using access provided by the customer.
certain openpath employees also will have access to account data, solely in connection with the provisioning of the openpath system and to respond to specific customer and partner requests for technical support. openpath will access account data only for the purposes of providing the openpath system, preventing or addressing service or technical problems, in accordance with the provisions of any separate written agreement between openpath and customer (such as, for example, the openpath terms and conditions applicable to the openpath system (as applicable, the “terms and conditions”)), or as may be required by law.

types of account data collected related to the openpath system
openpath collects the following types of account data:
information provided by customers: the openpath system provides the capability for customers to store basic personal information such as an individual’s name, credential number, email address and photograph. this information is used to correlate security events to the correct individual, as well as to enable notifications and mobile application functionality. the customer is solely responsible for determining if storage of this data is appropriate in the context of applicable laws and regulations.
information generated from events: the openpath system is used by the customer to collect activity and event data. for example, the customer can use the openpath system to record that an access card was used at a particular door at a certain time. through correlation with the information a customer provides, openpath may be able to tie an access event to a particular individual’s credential.
log information: the openpath system records the actions of administrators, as well as the status and the settings of various devices that have been configured to operate with the openpath system. log information may be used by the customer to review the activity of administrators.
mobile application: openpath provides a mobile application which can be used with the openpath system. the openpath mobile app is a form of digital credential used to authorize physical access to a building. openpath collects information about the location of the device and its proximity to certain available openpath readers within bluetooth range of the openpath mobile app to simplify authorization to open the proper lock or door. in order to provide these services, openpath collects various types of device, wifi access point data and bluetooth data. in order to use the services of the openpath mobile applications, various features such as location services, wifi, and bluetooth communication will need to be enabled on the mobile device.
location data: in order for some features to work reliably, the openpath mobile app requires location services always enabled. we don't ever collect your physical location or gps information, and do not share or sell your data to third parties. the app doesn't actually use your physical location, but rather bluetooth low energy (ble), which ios and android consider as part of their location services.
on ios devices: the openpath app also uses motion services in order to detect if a phone is in motion – if it is stationary, the openpath background service will shut down in order to conserve battery. if the app detects the phone is moving, the openpath service will resume in order to communicate with any nearby openpath readers.

logging data: openpath does not log the geolocation or gps of your phone. we temporarily log motion data on ios devices and can only receive that data if you send feedback via the app for troubleshooting purposes.

if you'd rather not enable these features, you can still unlock entries on ios devices by using touch to unlock with the openpath app open and bluetooth turned on. on android devices, touch to unlock won't work if location services is turned off regardless if the app is open or not, but you can still use the app to unlock entries by tapping on the lock icons next to the entries.
account data may be used by openpath to:
enable event notifications and openpath mobile app functionality.

compliance with general data protection directive (gdpr)
in the context of gdpr, individuals residing in the european economic area with data stored in the openpath system or using openpath applications are considered “data subjects.” customers (and in some cases partners) are considered “data controllers.” openpath is a “data processor.”
in openpath’s role as a data processor, openpath is the responsible custodian of the data subject’s data, performing this role on behalf of the data controller. the data controller is completely responsible to determine what data is captured, stored and processed within the openpath system. openpath does not share, sell, rent, or trade personally identifiable information with third parties unless directed by a data controller.
within openpath’s service model, most data subjects will have limited direct interaction with the openpath system applications that capture and store their data. this interaction by data subjects will primarily be via the openpath mobile app. most data subjects will be employees, visitors, or contractors of the data controller. data is captured based on their relationship with the data controller. the data controller is responsible for gaining necessary consent from the data subject regarding the data to be stored. in cases where a data subject requests account data to be deleted from the openpath system, openpath will refer such request to the data controller for adjudication.
the gdpr includes provisions that grant data subjects portability rights in their personal data. openpath will coordinate with data controllers and, as applicable data subjects, when requested to delete, anonymize or port data. openpath provides for portability and is continually working to enhance its data export capabilities.
openpath will continue to monitor the gdpr and evolve openpath’s systems and processes to ensure continued compliance.

gdpr right of individual access and limited use
those residing within the european economic area may request to access, correct, or limit the use of their personal information within the openpath system by submitting a request to their openpath administrator. individuals may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where they live, where they work or where they feel their rights were infringed if they have concerns about their rights.
