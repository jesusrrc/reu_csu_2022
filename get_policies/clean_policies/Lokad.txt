the quantitative supply chain manifesto
if you can't measure it, you can't optimize it.
all possible futures must be considered; a probability for each possibility.
all feasible decisions must be considered; possibilities vs. probabilities.
economic drivers must be used to prioritize feasible decisions.
being in control requires automation of every mundane task.
a supply chain scientist must take ownership of the numerical results.

get a new perspective on your supply chain
the quantitative supply chain represents a novel and disruptive perspective on the optimization of supply chains. it can be seen as a refoundation of many supply chain practices, in particular regarding inventory forecasting, and has been built to make the most of the latest statistical approaches and vast computing resources that are available nowadays.
this perspective has emerged at lokad, a software company founded by joannes vermorel. lokad mixes data analysis with machine learning, cloud computing and supply chain expertise in order to optimize supply chains in a rational and quantitative way, so that the business and financial impacts of every decision are properly quantified. his experience at lokad has given joannes vermorel the opportunity to study and analyze the methods, challenges and performances of dozens of companies all over the world.
this book is intended for supply chain executives and managers who want their supply chains to perform more, faster and with less resources. it caters to those who, ultimately, want to be more in control of their supply chain, with a more precise idea of what their decisions entail. this book provides a comprehensive introduction to the insights, methodologies and tools that have been gathered under the quantitative supply chain umbrella.
the first part of this book covers the general concepts associated with the quantitative supply chain. it outlines how this perspective differs from the classic supply chain perspective, and sheds lights on the core insights. the second part of this book provides hands-on materials to implement a quantitative supply chain initiative. it leverages lokad as a programmatic platform tailored for quantitative supply chain purposes.
