l. eu-u.s. & swiss-u.s. privacy shield
advantech adheres to the principles of the eu-u.s. and swiss-u.s. privacy shield frameworks.
2. how we use personal data
advantech uses  the data we collect for three basic purposes, described in more detail below:  (1) to operate our business and provide (including improving and personalizing) the  products we offer, (2) to send communications, including promotional communications,  and (3) to show advertising, whether in our own products supported by advertising like edm and campaign, or in products offered by third parties. the proportion of customer information used in (2) & (3) is currently about 55%, and it is carried out with the consent of the customers.
in carrying out these  purposes, we combine data we collect to give you a more seamless, consistent  and personalized experience. for example, myadvantech and estore can use information  about the products and services you use to make personalized solution ready packages  recommendations. however, to enhance privacy, we have built in technological  and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations. for  example, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not  signed in) separately from any account information  that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address or phone number.
a. providing and improving our products. we use data to  provide and improve the products we offer and perform essential business  operations. this includes operating the products, maintaining and improving the  performance of the products, developing new features, conducting research, and  providing customer support. examples of such uses include the following:
providing the products. we use data to carry out your transactions with us and to provide our products to you. often, those products include personalized features and recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment, and automatically tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about your activities, interests and location.
customer support. we use data to       diagnose product problems, repair customers' devices, and provide other customer care and support services.
product activation. we use data—such as       device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network and subscription identifiers—to activate software and devices that require activation.
product improvement. we use data to       continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. for example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and audio recordings from voice input features to improve speech recognition accuracy.
security, safety and dispute resolution. we use data to protect the security and safety of our products and our customers, to detect and prevent fraud, to confirm the validity of software licenses, to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices.
business operations. we use data to       develop aggregate analysis and business intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions, and report on the performance of our business.
b. communications
we use data we collect to  communicate with you and personalize our communications with you. for example,  we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a  subscription is ending, discuss your licensing account, let you know when security updates are available, remind you about items left  in your online shopping cart, update you or inquire about a service or repair  request, invite you to participate in a survey, or tell you that you need to  take action to keep your account active. additionally, you can sign up for  email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications  from advantech by email, sms, physical mail, and telephone. for information  about managing your contact data, email subscriptions and promotional  communications, please visit the access and controls section of this privacy statement.
c. advertising
advantech does  not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your  documents, photos or other personal files to target ads to you.
we use data we  collect through our interactions with you, through some of our products and on  third-party web properties, to show advertising. for example:
advantech may use your data to select and deliver some of the ads you see on advantech web properties, such as advantech.com, myadvantech and estore.
when the advertising id  is enabled in advantech.com as part of your privacy settings, advantech       apps can access and use the advertising id (much the same way that       websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie) to select and deliver ads.
we may share data we collect with third parties, such as siebel, salesforce, and google analytics so we can service you better and target our marketing messages to your preferences. nevertheless, we will ensure that those third parties comply with the data protection legislation applicable.
advertisers       may choose to place our web beacons on       their sites in order to allow advantech to collect information on their       sites such as activities, purchases and visits; we use this data on       behalf of our advertising customers to help target their ads. we also       share data directly with service providers, such as live chat to permit       them to provide services on our behalf or to partner with us in selecting       and serving ads for our advertising partners.
the ads that you  see may be selected based on data we process about you, such as your interests  and favorites, your location, your transactions, how you use our products, your  search queries, or the content you view.
the ads that you  see may also be selected based on other information learned about you over time  using demographic data,  location data, search queries, usage data from our  products and sites, as well as the sites and apps of our advertisers and  partners. we refer to these ads as "interest-based advertising" in  this statement. for example, if you view gaming content on advantech.com, you  may see offers for gaming on advantech’s marketing emails. to provide interest-based advertising, we  combine cookies placed on your device using information that we collect (such  as ip address) when your browser interacts with our websites. if you opt out of  receiving interest-based advertising, data associated with these cookies will  not be used.
further details regarding  our advertising-related uses of data include:
children and advertising. we do not deliver interest-based advertising to children whose birthdate in their advantech account identifies them as under 16 years of age.
data retention. for interest-based       advertising, we retain data for no more than 12 months, unless we obtain your consent to retain the data longer.
data sharing. in some cases, we       share with advertisers reports about the data we have collected on their sites or ads.
data collected by other advertising companies. advertisers sometimes include their own web beacons (or those of their other advertising partners) within their advertisements that we display, enabling them to set and read their own cookie. additionally, advantech partners with third-party ad companies to help provide some of our advertising services, and we also allow other third-party ad companies to display advertisements on our sites. these third parties may place cookies on your computer and collect data about your online activities across websites or online services. these companies may also be members of the nai or daa, which each provide a simple way to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies.
3. reasons we share personal data
we share your  personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or  provide any product you have requested or authorized. for example, we share your  content with third parties when you tell us to do so. when you provide payment  data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other  entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services,  and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction.
in addition, we share  personal data among advantech-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. we also  share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the  purposes described in this statement. for example, companies we've hired to  provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our  systems and services may need access to personal data to provide those  functions. in such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and  security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive  from us for any other purpose. we may also disclose personal data as part of a  corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.
finally, we will access,  transfer, disclose, and preserve personal data, including your content, when we  have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:
comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;
protect our customers, for example to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of our products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone;
operate and maintain the security of our products, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks; or
protect the rights or property of advantech, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services - however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of advantech, we will not inspect a customer's private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.
please note that  some of our products include links to products of third parties whose privacy  practices differ from advantech's. if you provide personal data to any of those  products, your data is governed by their privacy statements.
4. how to access & control your personal data
you can view,  edit, or delete your personal data online from many of advantech’s websites. you can  also make choices about advantech's collection and use of your data. how you  can access or control your personal data will depend on which websites you use.  for example:
advantech account (my       advantech and estore). if you wish to access, edit, or remove the profile       information and payment information in your advantech       account, change your password, add security information or close       your account, you can do so. from here, you can also access controls for       other advantech products.
advantech store. you can access your       advantech store profile and account information, and clicking on "view account" or "order history"
advantech.com you can access and       update your profile on advantech.com
if you cannot access certain personal data collected by advantech via the links above or directly through the advantech websites you use, you can always contact advantech by visiting our contact us page. we will respond to requests to access or delete your personal data within 30 days
a. your  communications preferences
you can choose  whether you wish to receive promotional communications from advantech by email,  sms, physical mail, and telephone. if you receive promotional email or sms  messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions  in that message. you can also make choices about the receipt of promotional  email, telephone calls, and postal mail by signing in with  your personal advantech account, and viewing your communication permissions where you can update  contact information, manage advantech-wide contact preferences, opt out of  email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with  advantech partners. if you do not have a personal advantech account, you can  manage your advantech email contact preferences by using this web form[link to form]. these choices do not apply  to mandatory service communications that are part of certain advantech  services, or to surveys or other informational communications that have their  own unsubscribe method.
b. your advertising choices
you may opt out of receiving  interest-based advertising from advantech by visiting here (please click "user" in upper right corner then click "my profile" and you will be able to update your preference). when you opt out, your  selection will be stored in a cookie that is specific to the web  browser you are using. the opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years.  if you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt out again.
you can also link your  opt-out choice with your personal advantech account. it will then apply on any  device where you use that account, and will continue to apply until  someone signs in with a different personal advantech account on that device. if  you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign in again for the settings  to apply.
for advertising that appears  in apps on windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal advantech  account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising id in windows settings.
because the data used for  interest-based advertising is also used for other legitimate and necessary  purposes (including providing our products, analytics and fraud detection),  opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data from being  collected. nor does it mean you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads.  however, if you do opt out, the ads you receive will no longer be  interest-based and may be less relevant to your interests.
you can opt out of receiving  interest-based advertising from third parties we partner with by visiting their  sites.
c. browser-based controls
cookie controls. relevant browser-based cookie controls are described in       the cookies section of this privacy statement.
tracking protection. internet explorer       (versions 9 and up) has a feature called tracking protection that will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a tracking protection list you add. by limiting calls to these sites, the browser will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you.
browser controls for "do not track." some browsers have incorporated "do not       track" (dnt) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the dnt signal, advantech services do not currently respond to browser dnt signals. advantech continues to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to       treat dnt signals. in the meantime, you can use the range of other tools advantech provides to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising from advantech as described above.
d. cookie
what sort of cookies does the advantech use?
generally, our  cookies perform up to three different functions:
essential cookies:            some cookies are essential for the operation of our website. for example, some  cookies allow us to identify subscribers and ensure they can access the  subscription only pages. if a subscriber opts to disable these cookies, the  user will not be able to access all of the content that a subscription entitles  them to.
performance cookies:            we utilise other cookies to analyze how our visitors use our websites and to  monitor website performance. this allows us to provide a high quality  experience by customising our offering and quickly identifying and fixing any  issues that arise. for example, we might use performance cookies to keep track  of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most  effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages. we  might also use these cookies to highlight articles or site services that we think  will be of interest to you based on your usage of the website.
functionality cookies:            we use functionality cookies to allow us to remember your preferences. for  example, cookies save you the trouble of typing in your username every time you  access the site, and recall your customization preferences, such as which  regional edition of the website you want to see when you log in.
we also use  functionality cookies to provide you with enhanced services such as allowing  you to watch a video online. we also use or allow third parties to serve  cookies that fall into the four categories above. for example, like many  companies, we use google analytics to help us monitor our website traffic. we  may also use third party cookies to help us with market research, revenue  tracking, improving site functionality and monitoring compliance with our terms  and conditions and copyright policy.
can a website user block cookies?
as we’ve  explained above, cookies help you to get the most out of our websites. however,  if you do wish to disable our cookies then please follow the instructions below  from main browser providers:
instructions for  microsoft internet explorer -click here.
instructions for  mozilla firefox -click here.
instructions for  google chrome -click here.
instructions for  apple safari -click here.
please  remember that if you do choose to disable cookies, you may find that certain  sections of our website do not work properly.
e. we track whether users open our emails?
our emails may contain a single, campaign-unique “web beacon pixel” to tell us whether our emails are opened and verify any clicks through to links within the email. we may use this information for purposes including determining which of our emails are more interesting to users, to query whether users who do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them.
5. lawful bases for processing
