scope
your privacy is very important to us. unifly therefor carefully considers the protection of your personal data during the different personal data processing activities.
this policy aims to tell you which personal data we collect from you, why we collect this data and how your data will be used. in addition, you can find information about your rights as a data subject.
the pdf version of the privacy and data protection policy of unifly can be found here.
what is personal data and data protection?
the applicable data protection legislation uses specific language and in order to help you to better understand the terminology and this policy, we will explain the most important elements below. if you want more information, you can always check out the website of the european commission at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens_en.
which data protection regulation is applicable?
the basic principles and obligations are documented in the general data protection regulation (the famous gdpr or in legalese regulation (eu) 2016/679 of the european parliament and of the council of 27 april 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data).
next, the eprivacy directive (directive 2002/58/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 12 july 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector) is applicable in specific cases, such as the use of cookies.
in addition to the european regulations, the national data protection legislation still applies to the processing of your personal data. in belgium, i.a. the law of 8 december 1992 on the protection of privacy with regard to the processing of personal data and the law of 13 june 2005 on electronic communications apply.
what is personal data?
personal data is all the information about an identified or identifiable natural person, also known as the data subject (a.k.a. you). a person is considered ‘identifiable’ when a natural person can be directly or indirectly identified, in particular by reference to an identifier such as:

or one or more elements that are characteristic of the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person (article 4, §1 gdpr).
data relating to race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership and processing of genetic data, biometric data for the unique identification of a person, or data about health, sexual behaviour or sexual orientation, criminal offences or convictions are considered sensitive data. unless an organisation can refer to one of the exceptions, the processing of these data is forbidden pursuant article 9 of the gdpr.
we at unifly, do not process any sensitive personal data. if we would at any time require these types of data for providing you with our services, we will always ask you for your explicit consent and provide you with additional safeguards.

controller vs. processor
the controller is a natural or legal person that determines the purposes and means for the processing of personal data. the processor on the other hand, processes this data on behalf of and only on request and with instructions from the controller (art. 4, §7 and §8 gdpr).

what are the basic principles of data protection?
lawfulness
personal data must be processed fairly and lawfully with respect to you. in order to process personal data lawfully, a legal basis must exist.
pursuant article 6 of the gdpr, these legal bases are:

legitimate interest.
unifly ensures that it always refers to at least one of the above-mentioned legal bases when it processes personal data. more about our processing activities and their legal ground can be found below.
fairness
the fairness of processing obliges us to only process your accurate (updated) data for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes. processing incompatible with the initial purpose for which the data were collected, is not allowed.
data minimisation is also a key principle and limits the processing to what is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected. this also implies the processing must be limited in time.
transparency
you as a data subject must be made aware of the following matters in clear and plain language:
identity and contact details of the controller;
identity and contact details of the controller;
if a data protection officer is appointed and his or her contact details;
if a data protection officer is appointed and his or her contact details;

if the personal data is received from a third party, the categories of personal data received and the third party.
specific legislation may contain exceptions or set additional requirements which the organisation must comply with, with respect to the provision of information to data subjects. these mandatory legal provisions take precedence over this policy.
confidentiality and integrity
technical and organisational measures must be taken to ensure the processing of personal data can take place with the appropriate guarantees, so that the data are protected against accidental loss and against unlawful processing, destruction or damage.
what personal data do we process?
the data you actively and knowingly provide us
in principle we at unifly only process data we have received directly from you, for example when you use one of our products and you register or when you fill in the contact form at our website.
the data you provide to us by the use of our service
you might not be aware of it but by using our service you provide us with some data that might be personal (‘observed data’), such as your location data, ip address, metadata (data that provides information about other data) and login codes and passwords.

unifly only processes personal data if necessary to achieve a certain objective. that is why we use your personal data when necessary for:

otherwise, we will make sure to obtain your explicit consent.
if you have given your consent for a specific processing purpose to unifly in order to process your data for that purpose, you can withdraw this consent at any time. we will then stop any further processing of your data for which you gave consent and will inform you of the possible consequences of your withdrawal of consent. if unifly processes your personal data for other purposes and in order to do so it refers to other legal bases, we will still be allowed to process your personal data.
processing activities
unifly tries via its current privacy and data protection policy to provide you with this information in order to be as transparent as possible with respect to the processing of your personal data. this general policy must be read together with more specific information notes which give additional information concerning about the organisation’s specific processing purposes.
we process your personal data for the following:
to prepare or execute an agreement with you
to prepare, execute or terminate an agreement, we will need certain personal data which may vary depending on the type of contract. the retention period will depend on the type of agreement and the legal requirements.
offering our utm services via our products
we adhere to the principle of data minimisation. therefore, we provide you with the possibility to use our applications anonymously. keep in mind that some features may not be accessible when you choose this option (such as the creation of the ability to manage your drones).
when you choose to register, we need your contact details (name, mailing address, address and telephone number), location data, login code and password to offer you our utm services and/or validate your flights.
if you use the logbook and drone management features, you can enter additional personal data in our application such as your birthdate, possessions (drones), licenses, photographs of drones, etc. we process these data based on legitimate interests. these data are stored as long as necessary for the processing purpose. with regard to the importance in litigations or other procedures, your data is stored for two years after the termination of our service. if you are a paying customer, legal retention periods are applicable which imply a retention period of seven years.
to send direct marketing communications
sending out our newsletter or other direct marketing communications will only occur based on your explicit consent. based on our legitimate interest we may also process your profession in order to send you more personal and relevant information. you may unsubscribe at any time.
to inform you about our products/ services
if you ask us for more information via the contact form on our website or by telephone, we need to process your contact information in order to provide you with this information. we will only use this data to provide you with the requested information based on our legitimate interest. for direct marketing communications afterwards, we will ask your consent.
to enhance security
we may use your personal data to enhance the security of our networks and information systems based on our legitimate interest. this means we can monitor your access to our networks and systems and collect some metadata.
in our offices several surveillance cameras are installed to guarantee the safety of our personnel or property. these images are only processed with regard to this security objective and deleted after one month. in addition, we also require visitors to register. for security reasons, this data is stored for one year.
to improve our products
in order for unifly to improve our products and to understand how people interact with them, we may process your data on the use of our products based on our legitimate interest. for example, we collect data on how many times you have accessed your account.
if we wish to use your data for statistics, we will anonymise this data first.
