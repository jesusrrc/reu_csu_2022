there is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically        collected by itw linx. this information can include: your ip address,        browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. this        information is used by itw linx for the operation of the service, to        maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use        of the itw linx site.
please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information        or personally sensitive data through itw linx public message boards,        this information may be collected and used by others. note: itw linx        does not read any of your private online communications.
itw linx encourages you to review the privacy statements of web sites        you choose to link to from itw linx so that you can understand how those        web sites collect, use and share your information. itw linx is not responsible        for the privacy statements or other content on web sites outside of the itw linx        and itw linx family of web sites.
use of your personal information
itw linx collects and uses your personal information to operate the itw linx        web site and deliver the services you have requested. itw linx also uses        your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services        available from itw linx and its affiliates. itw linx may also        contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services        or of potential new services that may be offered.
itw linx does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.        itw linx may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business        partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. in those cases,        your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone        number) is not transferred to the third party. in addition, itw linx        may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send        you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. all        such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to        provide these services to itw linx, and they are required to maintain        the confidentiality of your information.
itw linx does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such        as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.
itw linx keeps track of the web sites and pages our customers visit within        itw linx, in order to determine what itw linx services are        the most popular. this data is used to deliver customized content and advertising        within itw linx to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested        in a particular subject area.
itw linx web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice,        only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is        necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process        served on itw linx or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or        property of itw linx; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect        the personal safety of users of itw linx, or the public.
use of cookies
the itw linx web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online        experience. a cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page        server. cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.        cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the        domain that issued the cookie to you.
one of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save        you time. the purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned        to a specific page. for example, if you personalize itw linx pages, or        register with itw linx site or services, a cookie helps itw linx        to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. this simplifies the process        of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,        and so on. when you return to the same itw linx web site, the information        you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the itw linx        features that you customized.
you have the ability to accept or decline cookies. most web browsers automatically        accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies        if you prefer. if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience        the interactive features of the itw linx services or web sites you visit.
security of your personal information
itw linx secures your personal information from unauthorized access,        use or disclosure. itw linx secures the personally identifiable information        you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from        unauthorized access, use or disclosure. when personal information (such as a credit        card number) is transmitted to other web sites, it is protected through the use        of encryption, such as the secure socket layer (ssl) protocol.
changes to this statement
itw linx will occasionally update this statement of privacy to reflectcompany and customer feedback. itw linx encourages you to periodically        review this statement to be informed of how itw linx is protecting your        information.

itw linx welcomes your comments regarding this statement of privacy.        if you believe that itw linx has not adhered to this statement, please        contact itw linx at sales@itwlinx.com.        we will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the        problem.
