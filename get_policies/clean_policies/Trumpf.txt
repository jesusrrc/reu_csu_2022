"cookies" are small text files that your browser can store on your device. these text files contain a unique character string that identifies the browser when you return to the website. the process of saving a cookie file is also called "setting a cookie". cookies can be set both by the website itself and by external web services.
legal basis for the processing of personal data
art. 6 para. 1 lit. f gdpr (legitimate interest) or art. 6 para. 1 lit. a or art. 9 para. 1 lit. a or art. 49 para. 1 lit. a gdpr (consent).

online meetings via microsoft teams
we use microsoft teams for telephone and / video conferences, webinars and virtual tours (collectively: "online meetings"). microsoft teams is part of microsoft 365 from the microsoft corporation, one microsoft way, redmond 98052-6399, usa.
your data is therefore processed in a third country which is not classified as a safe third country by the european commission. however, in order to guarantee an adequate level of data protection, we have concluded a data protection contract with microsoft which contains the data protection clauses of the european union standards.
if you are invited to an online meeting by trumpf, the following data can be processed: information on participant (first name, last name, e-mail address, profile picture, video picture), online meeting data (subject, description) as well as further data provided by you via the microsoft teams' chat function within an online meeting. if required, chat transcripts can be logged by trumpf. in this case, the transcripts are stored until the purpose of the transcript recording is no longer valid.
the scope of the data processing by trumpf depends on which information you provide.
legal basis for the processing of your personal data within the framework of online meetings is art. 6 para. 1 lit. b gdpr.
the online meetings are generally not recorded. if the meeting is recorded as an exception, all participants are asked to give their consent before and at the start of the recording. the recording will only take place if consent is given. if trumpf records an online meeting with your consent, the recordings are deleted as soon as the purpose for the recordings is no longer valid.
legal basis for the processing in case of recording is your consent, art. 6 para. 1 lit. a gdpr.
further details on data protection can be found in microsoft's data protection statement under https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-privacy.
google analytics
we use google analytics to analyze and statistically evaluate website usage. the data obtained is used to optimize our website and promotional activities.
google analytics is a web analytics service operated and provided by google (google inc., 1600 amphitheatre parkway, mountain view, ca 94043, usa; for europe: google ireland limited, gordon house, barrow street, dublin 4, ireland).
legal basis
your data will be processed on the basis of your given consent in accordance with art. 6 para. 1 lit. a or art. 49 para. 1 lit. a gdpr.
types of personal data
the following data, among others, is recorded during your website visit:
visitor-related data
ip address (in abbreviated form so that no clear assignment is possible); origin (country and city); language; operating system; device (pc, tablet pc or smartphone); browser and all add-ons used; computer resolution
traffic sources
the source of your visit (i.e. which website or advertising medium brought you to us)
user behavior
which files were downloaded? which videos were viewed? were advertising banners clicked? where did the visitor go? did the visitor click on other pages of the portal or completely skip them? how long did the visitor stay?
achievement of objectives
purchase of a product; subscription; download of files
google processes the data for website use on our behalf and is contractually obliged to take action to ensure the confidentiality of the data processed. google also processes this data for its own purposes (e.g. to create a profile or link to possible google accounts). the data the "cookies" collect about your website use are normally transmitted to a google server in the usa for analysis and stored there.
storage duration
google analytics stores cookies in your web browser for a period of two years from your last visit. these cookies contain a randomly generated user id that allows you to be identified during future visits to the site.
the recorded data is stored together with a randomly generated user id, which enables evaluation of pseudonymous user profiles this user-related data is automatically deleted by us after 2 years.
anonymize ip
this website uses ip anonymization ("anonymizeip" masking function). within the member states of the eu and the european economic area, the user's ip address is shortened and transmitted only anonymously. only in exceptional cases is the full ip address transferred to a google server in the usa and shortened there. on behalf of the operator of this website, google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.
transmission of personal data to a third country
when your data is processed, it may be (for a limited time) that your data is transmitted outside of the eea, for example, to the united states of america (art. 49 para. 1 lit a gdpr), where the high european standards of data protection do not apply. this means that the authorities can have access to the data for control and monitoring purposes, against which it may not be possible to exercise effective legal remedy or to assert the rights of the persons concerned.
revocation/objection
you can prevent this processing through the following measures:
it is possible to set your browser so that no "cookies" are saved. this can, however, mean that our website will not be fully functional.
it is also possible to prevent data collection using a browser add-on from google. you can find the add-on here: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
