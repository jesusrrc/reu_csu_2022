bitscape’s privacy policy

your privacy is important to us. this privacy statement explains the personal data bitscape processes, how bitscape processes it, and for what purposes.

bitscape offers a wide range of products, services, packaged ip solutions-based offerings and managed services, including support used to help operate enterprises worldwide. references to bitscape products in this statement include bitscape services, websites, apps, software, servers, platforms and devices bundled offerings.

please read the specific details in this privacy statement, which provide additional relevant information. this statement applies to the interactions bitscape has with you and the bitscape offerings, as well as other bitscape products that display this statement.

personal data we collect

bitscape collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our "services", "applications", and "platforms". you provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our products, services and offerings. the data we collect depends on the context of your interactions or usage of "services", "applications", and "platforms" with bitscape and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. we also obtain data about you from third parties.

you have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. when we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. many of our "services", "applications", and "platforms" require some personal data to provide you with an effective service. if you choose not to provide data necessary to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature or in case of service we cannot render services. likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing "services", "applications", and "platforms" or offerings you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. we will notify you if this is the case at the time. where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization or similar offerings that use such data will not work for you.

how we use personal data

bitscape uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences. in particular, we use data to:

provide our "services", "applications", and "platforms", which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. it also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.
improve and develop our "services", "applications", and "platforms" offerings.
personalize our "services", "applications", "platforms" and delivery and make recommendations.
advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.

we also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.

in carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of our two different engagement or "services" or "applications", or "platforms" usage scenario) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.

reasons we share personal data

we share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any "services", "applications", and "platforms" you have requested or authorized.

we also share data with bitscape’s-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights and property of bitscape and its customers.

how to access and control your personal data

you can also make choices about the collection and use of your data by bitscape. you can control your personal data that bitscape has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, by contacting bitscape. in some cases, your ability to access or control your personal data will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law.
