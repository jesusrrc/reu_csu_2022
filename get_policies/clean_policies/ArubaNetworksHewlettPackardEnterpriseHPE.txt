gdpr compliance
the general data protection regulation (“gdpr”) is a landmark piece of european data protection legislation which strengthens and unifies data protection for individuals within the european union (eu). it impacts every organization that processes european personal data both inside and outside europe and introduced increased compliance requirements and significant financial penalties for companies that fail to comply. the gdpr was passed in may 2016 and came into force in may 2018.  not only is aruba gdpr compliant, but aruba’s products and services can help our customer’s maintain gdpr compliance.
