other information we may collect, including ‘cookies’

browser and device information

information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies
demographic information and other information provided by you that does not reveal your specific identity,
information that has been aggregated in a manner that it no longer reveals your specific identity

uses and disclosures of other information
we may use and disclose other information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. if we are required to treat other information as personal information under applicable law, then we may use and disclose it for the purposes for which we use and disclose personal information as detailed in this privacy statement.
in some instances, we may combine other information with personal information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). if we combine any other information with personal information, the combined information will be treated as personal information as long as it is combined.
security measures
schlumberger has implemented technological and operational security processes to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction. while no security measure can guarantee against compromise, schlumberger regularly reviews and updates its security measures in an effort to provide appropriate security for all information held by schlumberger. if you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the “contacting us” section below.
modifications to this privacy statement
schlumberger reserves the right to change, modify, or update this privacy statement at any time. the “last updated” legend at the top of this privacy statement indicates when this privacy statement was last revised. any changes will become effective when we post the revised privacy statement on the services. your use of the services following these changes means that you accept the revised privacy statement.
your rights
schlumberger wants to maintain only accurate information about users of the site. if you would like to request access to personal information that you have previously provided to us you may contact us by using this form https://www.slb.com/contact-us. we will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.
in your request, please make clear what personal information to which you would like access and your purpose for making the request. for your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the personal information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.
please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion).
data retention
schlumberger will not retain your personal information longer than is necessary and permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained. the criteria used to determine our retention periods include: (i) the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you; (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject; or (iii) whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
children
schlumberger takes children's privacy seriously. the services are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13) and we ask children under the age of 13 not to send any personally identifiable information to the services without the consent of their parents or guardians. schlumberger encourages all parents and guardians to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of personal information on the internet. schlumberger will not knowingly collect, use, or disclose to third parties any personal information collected from children, and we are committed to complying with applicable laws and requirements, such as the united states' children's online privacy protection act (coppa).
jurisdiction and cross-border transfer
in nearly all cases your personal information may be collected or processed by, and transferred to, schlumberger facilities in the united states and in other countries where schlumberger does business. your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the services you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the united states, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.
if you are located in the eea: some of the non-eea countries are recognized by the european commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to eea standards (the full list of these countries is available here http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm). for transfers from the eea to countries not considered adequate by the european commission, we have put in place adequate measures, such as standard contractual clauses adopted by the european commission to protect your personal information.
linked websites
we may provide links to third party sites. since we do not control these websites, we encourage you to review the privacy statement posted on these (and all) third party sites. schlumberger is not responsible for the privacy statements or practices of sites and services controlled by companies or organizations other than schlumberger. the inclusion of a link on the services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.
in addition, we are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as facebook, apple, google, microsoft, rim or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including with respect to any personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the apps or our social media pages.
contact information
if you have any questions about this privacy statement, please contact us using this form https://www.slb.com/contact-us, where you can also find the contact details of schlumberger limited and our eu contact details.
