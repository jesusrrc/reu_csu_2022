this notice describes how npm, inc., or npm for short, collects and uses data about you.
what's most important?
that depends on your personal situation, which is why you should read onand decide for yourself. but at a minimum, absolutely every npm usershould understand:
the npm public registry is for making software available to everyoneonline.
but: software comes from people, and says something about us.
so: think carefully about what packages to publish, what data you putin those packages, and what others might do with that data.
when you create an account, certain contact information is displayedpublicly in the npm platform. and when you upload a package, your nameand contact information may become associated with that package.
if you find yourself in a jam,open a support ticket.
