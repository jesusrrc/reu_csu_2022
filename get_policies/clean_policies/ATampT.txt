customer proprietary network information (cpni)
cpni is information about your telecommunications and voip (internet phone) services from us, including what plans you subscribe to, how you use these services and details such as who you have called. (your telephone number, name                            and address are not considered cpni.) we use cpni internally and share it outside at&t only when conforming with applicable regulations and orders of the federal communications commission.
we do not share cpni with anyone outside of the at&t affiliatesbutton icon                            defined above or our authorized agents or vendors without your consent, with the following authorized exceptions: court orders; as authorized by law; fraud detection; to provide your service and route your calls; for network                            operations and security; aggregate (grouped) information and information that doesn’t identify you personally.
we do use your cpni internally. we may share information about our customers among the at&t affiliates and our agents to offer new or enhanced services or promotions. we can also use your cpni for the purpose of turning it                            into aggregate data or information that does not personally identify you.
it is your right and our duty under federal law to protect the confidentiality of your cpni.
if you don’t want us to use your cpni internally for things like offers, here is what you can do:
opt-out at att.com/cpni/optout.
call us at (800) 315.8303, any time of day, and follow the prompts.
chat with a service representative at (800) 288.2020 (consumer) or (800) 321.2000 (business).
if you choose to restrict our use of your cpni, it won’t affect your ability to use any of your services. you can change your mind at any time about letting us use or not use your cpni. if you restrict your cpni use, you may still                            get marketing from us, but it won’t be based on using your cpni.

a server log records your web activity by your computer or mobile device and plays a key role in improving web page performance and introducing new features. for example, it may record which search terms you’ve entered, or the links you’ve            clicked on. it may also record your browser information, such as your ip address, device type, how long you spend on a web page, and your browser's cookies.
some websites have “social network or other third-party plug-ins.” these plug-ins may provide information back to those sites, even if you don't click on or interact with the plug-in. it may also apply even if you don’t have an account            with them. social networks or third parties may use an identifier when transmitting from your browser. this might include information about your browser type, operating system, device type, ip address and the url of the web page where the            plug-in appears. if you use social networking tools or sites, we recommend you take a moment to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies.
