1. nauto device and customer data
the nauto device is anintelligent camera and sensor system that allows the collection of internal andexternal event data from vehicles in order to improve driver safety and fleetoperations. nauto devices use camera and sensor technology to scan a driver’senvironment and collect information. the device’s cameras are both inward andoutward facing. in addition to capturing video clips and images of drivers andpassengers, the nauto device also collects the following types of information:
gps location
network or internet protocol addresses
operating system id
mobile network details
nauto device identifier or registration details
nauto device settings
date, time and type of web requests
‍the nauto device and servicesmay also collect information about a vehicle’s environment and experience whileon the road, including information about:
geographic location and relative proximity of a vehicle to other vehicles
hazards, such as pedestrians (whose faces may be blurred), bicycles, weather, and other vehicles
collision, near-miss, hard braking, acceleration or cornering events
traffic patterns, speeds, and flow
lane and road departure
license plate numbers (which may be blurred) and other information such as color or make of surrounding vehicles

license plate
emergency contact information
face of driver
driver’s posture and other physical characteristics when driving
who was in a collision including passengers
live camera feed / photo images including passengers
audio recordings including passengers
the nauto device also uses face scanning and facial recognition software on the data captured by the nauto device in order to create a profile of a driver for nauto’s customers. for example, this software may create a profile based on a driver’s facial features, such as the distance between the eyes, nose and ears, for a particular driver, that it uses to connect a driver in one particular photo or video to another photo or video for customer’s benefit.  the device’s software may also analyse facial features, driver behaviour, posture and movements in order to ensure safety and to prevent accidents. this is done for safety reasons in order to protect the vital interests of drivers and passengers.   for example, the device may process the following information about a driver’s behavior:
the identity of the driver
driver behavior and actions or inaction
risks
number of passengers in the vehicle
drowsiness
inattention (e.g., phone use, passenger activity)
braking
speed, acceleration, and mileage
driving time
nauto device tampering
vehicle security (e.g., audio listening of broken glass, stolen vehicle)
not obeying the rules of the road, e.g. texting while driving, ignoring traffic control signals or signs, dui (i.e. drink-driving)
some of this information may beconsidered to be sensitive personal information. some images and informationabout members of the public may also be captured by the device.
to the extent requested by acustomer, we may create account “profiles”for drivers. these profiles allow nauto to display a driver’s profile name andphoto, and to link that profile with information collected by that driver’snauto device. in order to create these profiles on behalf of customers, nautomay collect information such as names, username, password, photographs,location, and contact information of drives. nauto may also collect informationderived from its use of facial scanning and facial recognition software and itsanalysis of behavior, posture, and movements of persons who appear in datacaptured on nauto devices.
in addition, drivers andpassengers may transmit information to nauto on behalf of customers byrecording a short voice note using the nauto device. nauto processes the voicenote on behalf of its customer to understand additional details of an incidentor passenger interaction and may use the information to offer technical oremergency support to drivers on behalf of its nauto customers.
the device may also, on a customer’sbehalf, collect other information about a driver’s environment and experienceon the road including a vehicle’s speed, acceleration, braking, collisionevents, mileage, relative proximity to other vehicles, road conditions/hazards,traffic patterns/density and the details of surrounding vehicles.
