we will retain your personal information for no longer than is necessary for the purposes stated in this policy, unless otherwise extending the retention period is required or permitted by law. the data storage period may vary with scenario, product, and service. the standards 3onedata uses to determine the retention period are as follows: the time required to retain personal data to fulfill business purposes, including providing products and services; maintaining corresponding transaction and business records; controlling and improving the performance and quality of products and services; handling possible user queries or complaints and locating problems; whether the user agrees to a longer retention period; and whether the laws, contracts, and other equivalencies have special requirements for data retention; etc. we will maintain your registration information as long as your account is necessary for service provision. you can choose to deregister your account. after you deregister your account, we will stop providing you with products and services through your account and delete your relevant personal data, provided that deletion is not otherwise stipulated by special legal requirements.
