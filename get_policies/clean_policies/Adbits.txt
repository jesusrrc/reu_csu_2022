this privacy policy (		          "privacy policy") describes how adbit.biz as a data controller, collect, use		          and disclose personal data, and the steps we take to protect such personal data, provided by you or		          collected by us either on the website		          https://adbit.biz/		          (		          "website") or when you use the		          services or products that we provide or may provide in the future (		          "services").
1. data we collect about you
personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that		          person can be identified. it does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous		          data). we may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we		          have grouped together follows:
identity data, such as, first name, last name and date of birth;
contact data, such as, email address, mailing address and phone		            number;
financial data, such as, bank account, payment card details and		            billing address;
transaction data, such as, details about payments to and from you and		            other details of the		            services you have purchased from us;
profile data, such as, username, account number or password;
technical data, such as, the internet protocol (ip) address used to		            connect your computer to the		            internet, your login information (if applicable), browser type and version, time zone setting,		            browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, information about your visit,		            including the full uniform resource locators (url), clickstream to, through and from our website		            (including date and time), page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain		            pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouseovers), methods used to		            browse away from the page and any information of yours related to contact our customer service		            team;
usage data, such as, information you viewed or searched for and		            information about how you use		            our website and services; and
marketing and communications data, such as, your preferences in		            receiving marketing from us and		            our third parties and your communication responses.
we also collect, use and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data for any		          purpose. aggregated data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data		          in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. for example, we may		          aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature.		          however, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or		          indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in		          accordance with this privacy notice.
2. methods of data collection
we use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:
direct interactions. you may give us your identity, contact and		            financial data by filling in		            forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email, skype and other messenger or otherwise.		            this includes personal data you provide when you apply for our services, create an account on		            our website, subscribe to our service or publications, request marketing to be sent to you,		            enter a competition, promotion or survey, or give us some feedback, including report a problem		            with our website;
automated technologies or interactions. as you interact with our		            website, we may automatically		            collect technical data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. we collect this		            personal data by using cookies, server logs and other similar technologies. we may also receive		            technical data about you if you visit other websites employing our cookies.
third parties or publicly available sources. we may receive personal		            data about you from public		            domain, third parties (such as, analytics providers, advertising networks, search information		            providers and providers of technical, payment and delivery services) or other websites we		            operate or the other services we provide.
where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of an agreement we have with you		          and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the agreement we		          have or are trying to enter into with you, including to provide you with the services. in this case,		          we may have to cancel the services you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at		          the time.
3. use of your personal data
we will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. most commonly, we will use your		          personal data in the following circumstances:
where we need to perform the agreement, we are about to enter into or have entered into with		            you;
where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your		            interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests;
where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
legitimate interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to		          enable us to provide you with the best services and the best and most secure experience. we make		          sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your		          rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. we do not use your		          personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have		          your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in		          relation to sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message.		          you have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.
we may use your identity, contact, profile, technical and usage data to form a view on what we think		          you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. this is how we decide which services and		          offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). you may receive marketing communications		          from us if you have requested information from us or purchased services from us and, in each case,		          you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
you can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on		          any marketing message sent to you or by contact us at any time.
we will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably		          consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original		          purpose. if you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is		          compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
4. cookies and similar technologies
like most internet sites, our website may use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your user		          experience and provide customization and useful features to our website and services. you can set		          your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access		          cookies. if you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become		          inaccessible or not function properly.
5. disclosure of your personal data
except as outlined in this privacy policy, your personal data will never be sold or disclosed with		          other companies or organizations for commercial purposes or otherwise.
we reserve the right at all times to disclose any personal data that we have collected when: (a)		          permitted or required by law; or, (b) trying to protect against, prevent, investigate actual or		          potential fraud, security issues, technical issues, unauthorized transactions or other violations;		          or (c) trying to enforce the applicable terms of service or other agreements; or (d) protecting		          against violations to the rights, property or safety of us, our users or the public as required or		          permitted by applicable laws; or (e) you have given your consent to do so. finally, we may transfer		          personal data to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, partial or		          total sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
we may disclose your personal data to our contractors to process it for us, for the purposes of processing transactions, collecting		          fees, identifying you, but also for improving your user experience, performing business support		          functions or other related tasks, based on our instructions and in compliance with the privacy		          policy and any other applicable confidentiality and security requirements. in addition, transfers to		          our contractors are covered by the service agreements with such contractors.
6. data security
we adhere to the generally accepted industry standards to protect your personal data from being		          accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. only our		          authorized employees, agents and contractors (who have agreed to keep personal data secure and		          confidential) have access to the personal data on a need to know basis.
we store and process data, including personal data, through third parties that we use to operate and manage the services. when you access or use our		          websites or the services, or otherwise provide personal data to us, you are consenting, on behalf of		          you and your authorized agents, (and representing that you have the authority to provide such		          consent) to the processing and transfer of personal data in and to the other countries which may		          have different privacy laws from your or their country of residence. we will take all steps		          reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with		          this privacy policy.
any payment transactions will be encrypted. where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a		          password, which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping		          this password confidential. we ask you not to share a password with anyone.
you agree and acknowledge that the internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the		          submission of data over the internet may not be secure. we strive to use acceptable means to protect		          any personal data you share with us, however we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
7. data retention
we will retain your personal data only for so long as it is required for the purposes for which it		          was collected. this period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but only for so		          long as is reasonably necessary for us to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits,		          comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations (e.g. taxation purposes), resolve		          disputes and enforce our agreements.
to determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and		          sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of		          your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve		          those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
when your personal data is no longer required, we will destroy, delete or convert it into an		          anonymous form.
8. third-party links
the privacy practices set forth in this privacy policy apply to the website and services only. if you		          link to other web sites (including sites that offer or use the services or are promoted by us) or		          use the services of other service providers, please review the privacy policies posted at those web		          sites or by the relevant service providers.
9. age limitations
we do not allow use of our services and the website by anyone younger than 18 years old. if you learn		          that anyone younger than 18 has unlawfully provided us with personal data, please contact us and we		          will take steps to delete such information.
10. your rights
under certain circumstances, you have following rights under data protection laws in relation to your		          personal data:
right to request access to your personal data. this enables you to receive a copy of the		            personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;
right to request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. this enables you to		            have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify		            the accuracy of the new data you provide to us;
right to request erasure of your personal data. this enables you to ask us to delete or remove		            personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. you also have the		            right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised		            your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information		            unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. note,		            however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific		            legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;
right to object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate		            interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation		            which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your		            fundamental rights and freedoms. you also have the right to object where we are processing your		            personal data for direct marketing purposes. in some cases, we may demonstrate that we have		            compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and		            freedoms;
right to request restriction of processing of your personal data. this enables you to ask us to		            suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to		            establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us		            to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need		            it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your		            data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;
right to request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. we will provide		            to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,		            machine-readable format. note that this right only applies to automated information which you		            initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform an		            agreement with you; and
right to withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal		            data. however, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you		            withdraw your consent. if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain		            services to you. we will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).		          however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or		          excessive. alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your		          right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). this is a security		          measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.		          we may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up		          our response.
we try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. occasionally it may take us longer		          than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. in this		          case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
11. changes to this privacy policy
we may change this privacy policy unilaterally and without prior notice, but any changes will be		          posted on the website. if we make changes that materially alter your privacy rights, we will provide		          additional notice, such as via email or through the services. if you disagree with the changes to		          this privacy policy, you should stop using our services, the website or any other aspect of our		          business. your continued use of the website or our services constitutes your agreement to all such		          changes.
