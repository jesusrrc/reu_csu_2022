some of the skkynet network sites contain links to or integrations with other sites such as facebook, twitter, linkedin, etc., whose information practices may be different than ours. visitors should consult the other sites’ privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
11. international transfer
skkynet operates globally so it is necessary to transfer your information internationally. in particular, your information will likely be transferred to and processed in the united states where many of our central databases operate. the data protection and other laws of other countries, such as the united states, may not be as comprehensive as those in your country. please be assured that we take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. by using this skkynet network site or our services you consent to your information being collected, used and transferred as set forth in this privacy statement.
12. commitment to security
we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the information we collect online. these safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store.
