Facebook makes virtual, mixed and augmented reality (XR) hardware and software products and operates a platform on which users can download, interact with and submit content and obtain services related to or in connection with our XR products (collectively, {removed href} Oculus Products). The Oculus Products include our websites, mobile apps, games, platform, content, hardware and services as described in the {removed href} Supplemental Oculus Terms of Service and any product or service that links to this Supplemental Oculus Data Policy. For Facebook account users, Oculus Products are {removed href} Facebook Products.


The {removed href} Facebook Data Policy describes the information we process to support Facebook Products (as defined in the Facebook Data Policy), including Oculus Products and other Facebook Products available in the Oculus Products. This Supplemental Oculus Data Policy supplements the Facebook Data Policy by explaining the additional information we collect, use and share on our Oculus Products.

{list item} COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES: We receive information collected in or through various technologies on Oculus Products, including cookies, pixels, local storage and similar technologies. Learn more about how we use these technologies on our websites and mobile apps in the {removed href} Oculus Cookies Policy.

For example, we receive information about your Oculus Browser usage, such as interactions with recommended pages, which browser features you use, crash reporting data and other statistics related to your Oculus Browser. When you use our voice services, we process your voice interactions to respond to your request, provide the requested service to you and improve our voice services on Oculus. You can learn more about how we collect and use information from other features you interact with on the Oculus Products in our {removed href} Oculus Privacy FAQ.


{list item} ENVIRONMENTAL, DIMENSIONS AND MOVEMENT DATA: We collect information about your environment, physical movements and dimensions when you use an XR device. For example, when you set up the Oculus Guardian system to alert you when you approach a boundary, we receive information about the playing area that you have defined; and when you enable the hand tracking feature, we collect technical information such as your estimated hand size and hand movement data to enable this feature.


{list item} INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTIES: We receive information about you from third parties, including third-party apps, developers, other online content providers and marketing partners. For example, we receive information from developers about your achievements in their app and share this information with your friends on Oculus.

This can include information about you, such as when they send us an abuse report that refers to or contains a video of you.


{list item} TECHNICAL SYSTEM INFORMATION: We collect technical system information such as crash logs which may contain your user ID, your device ID, your IP address, the local computer file path, the feature quality, the amount of time it takes to load a feature and whether you use a certain feature.


HOW DO WE USE THIS INFORMATION?


{number list}.


{list item} We use information we collect when you use Oculus Products for the purposes described in the Facebook Data Policy under How do we use this information?, including to provide, personalise and improve the Facebook Products (including seamless integration between the Facebook Products); to provide measurement, analytics and other business services (including ads); to promote safety, integrity and security; to communicate with you; and to research and innovate for social good. In addition to these purposes, we use the information we collect when you use Oculus Products in the following ways:


{number list}.


{list item} TO POWER SOCIAL FEATURES: We use information from Oculus Products to provide user-to-user communications and other social services across the Facebook Products, including identifying and connecting you with your friends (or people you have recently interacted with in an experience) through Oculus Products.


{list item} TO OFFER AND IMPROVE XR FEATURES: We use information from the Oculus Products to improve and develop aspects of our services, such as voice services and hand tracking.

When you enable the hand tracking feature, we collect technical information such as hand tracking quality, the amount of time it takes to detect your hands and the number of pinches you make to improve and troubleshoot this feature.

{list item} If you enter a public virtual space, others can see your avatar just as they would see you in a real-world public space.
