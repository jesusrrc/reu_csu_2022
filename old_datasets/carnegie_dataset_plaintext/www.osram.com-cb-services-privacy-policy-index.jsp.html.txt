The data shall also be blocked or erased when a period of time prescribed for its storage under one of the above legal provisions expires, unless it is necessary for the data to still be stored so that a contract can be concluded or performed.

The following data is collected:


{number list}.


{list item} Information on the type of browser used and its version.


{list item} The users operating system.


{list item} The users Internet service provider.

{list item} The date and time of access.

This data is also stored in our systems log files. This data is not stored together with other personal data of the user.

The legal basis for temporary storage of data (and log files) is Article 6 paragraph 1 point (f) GDPR.


3. PURPOSE OF DATA PROCESSING.


Temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary so that the website can be delivered to the users computer system. To enable that, the users IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.


The data is stored in log files in order to ensure that the website functions properly. The data also helps us optimize the website and ensure the security of our IT systems. The data is not analyzed for marketing purposes in this connection.


This purpose also constitutes our legitimate interest in processing data in accordance with Article 6 paragraph 1 point (f) GDPR.

If the data is stored in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest. The data can be stored above and beyond that. In that case, the IP addresses of users are erased or anonymized so that the client calling the website can no longer be identified.


5. POSSIBILITY OF OPTING OUT.


Recording of data in order to deliver the website and storage of the data in log files is absolutely necessary for operating the Internet site. Consequently, users do not have the possibility of objecting and opting out.
