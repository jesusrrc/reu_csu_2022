YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.


California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their Personal Data (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information, disclosed to those parties. If you are a California resident and would like to request this information, please submit your request by call, chat or email at {removed href} {removed hyperref}/ or directly in MyNeato app.


CALIFORNIA DO-NOT-TRACK DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.


We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Website, and that is also why we provide the opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do-Not-Track signals, because the Internet industry is still working on uniform Do-Not-Track standards.


CHILDREN.


We do not knowingly collect any Personal Data from anyone under the age of eighteen (18) without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a person under the age of eighteen (18) has provided us with Personal Data, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.
