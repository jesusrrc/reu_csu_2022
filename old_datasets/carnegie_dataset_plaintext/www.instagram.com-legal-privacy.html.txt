III. HOW IS THIS INFORMATION SHARED?


Your information is shared with others in the following ways: SHARING ON FACEBOOK PRODUCTS PEOPLE AND ACCOUNTS YOU SHARE AND COMMUNICATE WITH When you share and communicate using our Products, {removed href} you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. {REMOVED HREF} PUBLIC INFORMATION can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they dont have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any information you share with a public audience; information in your {removed href} public profile on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, {removed href} public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as {removed href} Facebook Marketplace.

CONTENT OTHERS SHARE OR RESHARE ABOUT YOU You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as {removed href} Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone elses post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other persons content, and that person can change the audience {removed hyperref} can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages.

Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).

NOTE: WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF RESTRICTING DEVELOPERS DATA ACCESS EVEN FURTHER TO HELP PREVENT ABUSE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE WILL REMOVE DEVELOPERS ACCESS TO YOUR FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM DATA IF YOU HAVENT USED THEIR APP IN 3 MONTHS, AND WE ARE CHANGING LOGIN, SO THAT IN THE NEXT VERSION, WE WILL REDUCE THE DATA THAT AN APP CAN REQUEST WITHOUT APP REVIEW TO INCLUDE ONLY NAME, INSTAGRAM USERNAME AND BIO, PROFILE PHOTO AND EMAIL ADDRESS.

SHARING WITH THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS {removed href} We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We dont sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share information with: PARTNERS WHO USE OUR ANALYTICS SERVICES. We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account. ADVERTISERS. We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we dont share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser. MEASUREMENT PARTNERS. We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners. PARTNERS OFFERING GOODS AND SERVICES IN OUR PRODUCTS.

IV. HOW DO THE FACEBOOK COMPANIES WORK TOGETHER?


Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other {removed href} Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all {removed href} Facebook Company Products you use. We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products.


V. HOW CAN I MANAGE OR DELETE INFORMATION ABOUT ME?


We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in your {removed href} Facebook Settings and {removed href} Instagram Settings. We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of {removed href} content you have shared and {removed href} cookie data obtained through social plugins. When you delete your account, we {removed href} delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you wont be able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you isnt part of your account and wont be deleted. If you dont want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the {removed href} Facebook Settings and {removed href} Instagram Settings.

VII. HOW DO WE OPERATE AND TRANSFER DATA AS PART OF OUR GLOBAL SERVICES?


We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the {removed href} Facebook Terms and {removed href} Instagram Terms and to globally operate and provide our Products to you.
