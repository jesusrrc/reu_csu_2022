In the data centers, clusters that contain sensitive data are grouped together in the network topology, and will be placed in rooms with additional physical security protection.


Data exchanged between DF devices and servers are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).


There is an optional two-step verification process when users access their DF Account.


There is regular review of information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
