This policy describes how we handle your data when you use Times Services, listed below:

{list item} The New York Times newspaper, plus our International Edition.


{list item} Our websites, like {removed hyperref}.


{list item} Our apps, like the New York Times app and the New York Times Crossword app.


{list item} Our email newsletters, like Cooking and Morning Briefing.


{list item} Our pages or ads on social media networks, like our Facebook and Instagram pages.


{list item} Anywhere we gather information from you and refer you to this Privacy Policy.


How we handle information about you depends on which Times Services you use and how you use them. We use different information about print subscribers than website visitors.


Be aware that certain Times Services work differently. Some have additional terms that supplement this policy (e. g., {removed href} Reader Submissions). Others refer to a different privacy policy altogether, so this one does not apply.


{removed hyperref} Information Do We Gather About You?


The information we gather about you depends on the context. By and large, its information about you that can personally identify you either on its own or when combined with other information.


The following describes the information we collect and how we obtain it.


A) INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH TIMES SERVICES.


{bullet list}.


{list item} INFORMATION YOU VOLUNTARILY GIVE US.


{number list}.


{list item} FOR REGISTRATION: When you sign up for a Times Service (e. g., a subscription), we collect your contact information and account credentials. Once youre registered, we assign you a unique ID number. This ID number helps us recognize you when youre signed in. For some Times Services, you can instead sign up by linking your Apple, Facebook or Google account. See {removed href} From Other Sources below. If you register for an event or conference, we might ask for additional information (e. g., your company name, your job title or your dietary restrictions).


{list item} FOR BILLING: To process payments or donations, we collect and use your payment information. This can include your name, your address, your telephone number, your email address, your credit or debit card information and any other relevant information.


{list item} FOR USER-GENERATED CONTENT: We offer you the ability to post content that other users can read (e. g., comments or recipe reviews). Anyone can read, collect and use any personal information that accompanies your posts. See the {removed href} Comments F. A. Q., or read {removed href} User-Generated Content in our Terms of Service for more information. We do not have to publish any of your content. If the law requires us to take down, remove or edit your personal information, we will comply to the required extent.


{list item} FOR CONTESTS, SWEEPSTAKES AND SPECIAL OFFERS: When you sign up for these, you give us your name, email and any other required information.


{list item} FOR READER SURVEYS, RESEARCH, PANELS AND EXPERIENCE PROGRAMS: We gather information through questionnaires, surveys and feedback programs. We also conduct similar research for advertisers. We ask you for your consent to use this information when you participate in these programs and events.


{list item} DURING CONTACT WITH OUR CALL CENTERS: We collect information from you when you place an order over the phone or contact customer service through one of our toll-free numbers.


{list item} PERSONAL CONTACTS DATA: We never scan your device for your contacts or upload that data. With your consent, we do comply with your requests to collect data about your friends, family or acquaintances (e. g., Refer a Friend campaigns). This functionality is only meant for U. S. residents. By using it, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in the United States and that you have everyones consent for us to use their contact information.


{list item} INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY.


{number list}.


{list item} WITH TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES IN YOUR BROWSER AND MOBILE APPS: These technologies include cookies, web beacons, tags and scripts, software development kits (or SDKs) and beyond. We track and store data about how you visit and use Times Services, particularly through our websites and apps. The items we log include:


{number list}.


{list item} Your IP address.


{list item} Your location.


{list item} Your operating system.


{list item} Your browser.


{list item} Your browser language.


{list item} The URLs of any pages you visit on our sites and apps.


{list item} Device identifiers.


{list item} Advertising identifiers.


{list item} Other usage information.


We combine this data with other information we collect about you. For more information about tracking methods on Times Services, and how to manage them, read our {removed href} Cookie Policy. If your browser doesnt accept our cookies, you cant access certain parts of our websites (e. g., your account on {removed hyperref}). Because the Do Not Track browser-based standard signal has yet to gain widespread acceptance, we dont currently respond to those signals. We however respond to the {removed href} Global Privacy Control in certain territories, such as Europe and California.


{list item} WITH GPS TECHNOLOGIES: Some of our apps can provide content based on your GPS location, if you enable this feature (e. g., the New York Times Real Estate app). Your GPS location is your exact location. You choose whether to enable GPS features when you first install the app. You can edit that setting on your device at any time. If you enable these features, your GPS location can be found by satellite, cell phone tower or Wi-Fi and used by the app. If you save a location-based search in your history, that data moves to our service providers servers {removed href} see below for the definition of service provider. If you do not enable GPS location-based services, or if a specific app does not have location-based features (e. g., the New York Times app), we dont collect your precise GPS location. We do collect your IP address, which can establish your approximate location. Ads on our sites and apps may be targeted based on this approximate location, but are never targeted based on your GPS location.


B) INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM OTHER SOURCES.


{bullet list}.


{list item} PRIVATELY OWNED DATABASES: Marketing, data analytic and social media-owned databases give us access to a range of information like public data, survey data and beyond. This data sometimes includes your mailing address, your gender, your age, your household income and other demographic data.


{list item} SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICES: (Social media platforms include Facebook. Third-party services include Google and Nook.) You can link your social media or other third-party account to a Times Service. By linking the services, you authorize us to collect, store and use any information they may give us (e. g., your email address). You can disconnect your {removed hyperref} registration from third-party accounts at any time. We also receive information from you when you interact with our pages, groups, accounts or posts on social media platforms. This includes aggregate data on our followers (e. g., age, gender and location), engagement data (e. g., likes, comments, shares, reposts and clicks), awareness data (e. g., number of impressions and reach) and individual users public profiles. For more information, refer to our {removed href} social login and {removed href} Nook F. A. Q.


{list item} WORKPLACE AND SCHOOLS: When your employer or school buys an organizationwide subscription to {removed hyperref}, they sometimes provide us with your name and organization email address to grant you access as a user.


A NOTE ABOUT FUTURE UPDATES:


We are always improving our products and services, and we create new features regularly. These updates sometimes require us to collect new information, or use what we already have differently. If there is a significant or material change in the way we handle your personal information, we will notify you as detailed below.


{removed href} Back to top.


{removed hyperref} Do We Do With The Information We Collect About You?


A) WE PROVIDE THE TIMES SERVICES.


We use your information to help you use and navigate Times Services, such as:


{number list}.


{list item} Making a Times Service available to you.


{list item} Arranging access to your account.


{list item} Providing customer service.


{list item} Responding to your inquiries, requests, suggestions or complaints.


{list item} Completing your payments and transactions.


{list item} Sending service-related messages (e. g., a change in our terms and conditions).


{list item} Saving your reading list, recipes or property searches.


{list item} Displaying your Crossword stats.


{list item} Letting you take part in paid services, polls, promotions, surveys, panels, research and comments.


B) WE PERSONALIZE YOUR EXPERIENCE.


We track your interests and reading habits (e. g., the articles you read) to personalize your reading experience using technology like algorithmic recommendations and machine learning. This is how we highlight articles you might be interested in and de-emphasize articles youve already read. For more information about content personalization on Times Services, you can read the {removed href} Personalization F. A. Q. We also show you prices, promotions, products or services we believe youll find interesting, based on demographic and usage data.


C) WE ALLOW YOU TO SHARE USER-GENERATED CONTENT.


Any information you disclose in your content becomes public along with your chosen screen name and uploaded photo.


D) WE DEVELOP PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND DO ANALYSIS.


We analyze data on our users subscription, purchase and usage behaviors. This helps us make business and marketing decisions.


For example, our analysis lets us predict preferences and price points for our products and services. It helps us determine whether our marketing is successful. It also shows us characteristics about our readers, which we sometimes share in aggregate with advertisers.


Google Analytics is one of the analytics providers we use. You can find out {removed href} how Google Analytics uses data and {removed href} how to opt out of Google Analytics.


E) WE CARRY OUT ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS.


{number list}.


{list item} For auditing: We verify that our internal processes work as intended and comply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements.


{list item} For fraud and security monitoring: We detect and prevent cyberattacks or unauthorized robot activities.


{list item} For customer satisfaction: We assess users satisfaction with Times Services and our customer care team.


The above activities can involve outside companies, agents or contractors (service providers) with whom we share your personal information for these purposes (discussed further below).


F) WE OFFER SWEEPSTAKES, CONTESTS AND OTHER PROMOTIONS.


You can take part in our sweepstakes, contests and other promotions. Some might have additional rules about how we use and disclose your personal information.


G) WE ALLOW FOR PERSONALIZED ADVERTISING ON TIMES SERVICES AND CREATE AUDIENCES FOR THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISERS.


We gather data and work with {removed href} third parties to show you personalized ads on behalf of advertisers. This data comes from ad tracking technologies set by us or the third party (e. g., cookies), the information you provide (e. g., your email address), your use of Times Services (e. g., your reading history), information from advertisers or advertising vendors (e. g., demographic data) and anything inferred from any of this information. We only use or share this information in a manner that does not reveal your identity. For example, we use Google to serve ads on Times Services. Google uses cookies or unique device identifiers, in combination with their own data, to show you ads based on you visiting {removed hyperref} and other sites. You can opt out of the use of the Google cookie by visiting the {removed href} related Google privacy policy.


We also identify groups of users to whom to serve personalized ads on behalf of our advertisers. To do this, we combine information we collect through surveys or registration with information we collect automatically using tracking technologies while you browse our sites and apps. This combined information is used to build models. These data models are then used to measure users attributes, like their demographic information or their interests. Working with service providers, we use these measurements to group users by common attributes. Each group is associated with a random ID which is then passed to our ad server for use in targeting ad campaigns on our sites and apps.


Another example is our affiliate link vendors, which we use in our guides and product recommendations. Times Services include links that will send you to vendor URLs and other services not operated or controlled by us. These vendors use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your navigation from the Times Services to the merchant you are visiting. If you buy a product after following a link to a link vendors URL, we may earn a commission.


ADDITIONAL NOTES:


{number list}.


{list item} For more about targeted advertising, and how to opt out with your specific browser and device, go to the {removed href} DAA Webchoices Browser Check and {removed href} NAI Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising. You can {removed href} download the AppChoices app to opt out in mobile apps. You can also follow the instructions in the {removed href} What Are Your Rights? section below.


{list item} We try to limit how our third-party advertising technology vendors use the information they gather from you. Many of these providers require us to enter into contracts that allow them to optimize their own services and products, or that help them create their own.


Essentially, these providers combine any information they gather about you through Times Services with information they receive from their other clients. This helps them target ads to you on behalf of their other clients, not just us.


{list item} These third parties sometimes use other services in order to serve ads; check {removed href} their privacy policies for more details. For further information on tracking technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, see the applicable {removed href} Cookie Policy.


H) WE ADVERTISE TIMES SERVICES TO YOU.


We market our properties to you. Sometimes we use marketing vendors to do this.


We serve ads through websites, locations, platforms and services operated and owned by third parties. Often these ads are targeted at people who have visited or registered for a Times Service but have not subscribed or purchased anything. The ads are also targeted at people with similar traits or behaviors to our subscribers or customers.


We target our advertising to these users by uploading an encrypted customer list to a third party, or by incorporating a tracking technology from a third party onto our Times Service. The third party then matches individuals who appear in both our data and their data. Because of how this matching process works, the third party cant read our encrypted customer list if they dont already have it.


To opt out of receiving these matched ads, contact the applicable {removed href} third parties. For example, when we use Custom Audience to serve you our ad through Facebook, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of that Facebook ad and opt out. We are not responsible for any third partys failure to comply with opt-out requests.


We periodically send you targeted email newsletters or promotional emails. For information on opting out of these emails, see {removed href} What Are Your Rights?


I) WE AGGREGATE (OR DE-IDENTIFY) PERSONAL INFORMATION INTO LARGER FINDINGS.


Sometimes we aggregate or de-identify information so that it can no longer identify you, under applicable laws. This helps us better understand and represent our users, such as when we measure ad performance, create advertising interest-based segments or compile survey results. We can use and disclose this aggregated or de-identified information for any purpose, unless an applicable law says otherwise.

{list item} Cooperate with government authorities, which could be outside your country of residence.


{list item} We disclose public activities in our RSS feeds, APIs and other distribution formats. Your public activities could thus appear on other websites, blogs or feeds.

B) HOW DO YOU ACCESS, CHANGE, DELETE, UPDATE OR EXERCISE YOUR OTHER RIGHTS IN RELATION TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?


In some parts of the world, you have the right to:


{number list}.


{list item} Access, modify, or delete the personal information we have about you.

If youd like to exercise any of the above rights, contact us via {removed href} this form or by calling us at our toll-free number, 1-800-NYTIMES. In your request, please be specific. State the information you want changed, whether youd like your information suppressed from our database or whether there are limitations youd like us to put on how we use your personal information. Please use the email address linked to that personal information we only complete requests on the information linked to your email address. To verify your identity, we will email the email address you provide us, and which matches our records, and wait for your response. In some instances we may also ask for additional information. This is how we verify your identity before complying.


You can designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to do that, please provide the agent with written permission, signed by you, authorizing the agent to submit the request on your behalf. The agent must submit that written permission along with the request. We will contact you to verify your identity and the authorized agents permission before a response to the request is sent.


Well respond to your request in a manner consistent with applicable law.


We might need to keep certain information for recordkeeping purposes, or to complete a transaction you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e. g., if you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you might not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of the purchase or promotion).


In some cases, your request doesnt ensure complete removal of the content or information (e. g., if another user has reposted your content).


If youd like, you can lodge a complaint with a data protection authority. A {removed href} list of E. U. data protection authorities is available.

{removed href} Back to top.


{removed hyperref} Long Do You Retain Data?


It depends. We store your personal information for as long as needed, or permitted, based on the reason why we obtained it (consistent with applicable law). This means we might retain your personal information even after you close your account with us.


When deciding how long to keep your information, we consider:


{number list}.


{list item} How long we have had a relationship with you or provided a Times Service to you.

{list item} Whether we have taken any legal positions (e. g., in connection with any statutes of limitation).

{removed href} Back to top.


{removed hyperref} Do You Protect My Information?


We protect your personal information with a series of organizational, technological and physical safeguards but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

The New York Times Company is headquartered in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, your information is collected in your country and then transferred to the United States or to another country in which we (or our affiliates or service providers) operate.


If we transfer your data out of the European Economic Area (E. E. A.), we implement at least one of the three following safeguards:


{number list}.


{list item} We transfer your information to countries that have been recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to E. E. A. standards (see the {removed href} full list of these countries).


{list item} We use a service provider in the United States that is {removed href} Privacy Shield certified.

In certain situations, the courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those countries might be entitled to access your personal information.


{removed href} Back to top.


{removed hyperref} Is Our Legal Basis?


In some jurisdictions, like the European Union and the European Economic Area, we only collect, use or share information about you when we have a valid reason. This is called lawful basis. Specifically, this is one of the following:


{number list}.


{list item} The consent you provide to us at the point of collection of your information.


{list item} The performance of the contract we have with you.


{list item} The compliance of a legal obligation to which we are subject or.


{list item} The legitimate interests of The Times or a third party. Legitimate interest is a technical term under international laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. It means that there are good reasons for the processing of your personal information, and that we take measures to minimize the impact on your privacy rights and interests. Legitimate interest also refers to our use of your data in ways you would reasonably expect and that have a minimal privacy impact. We have a legitimate interest in gathering and processing personal information, for example: (1) to ensure that our networks and information are secure; (2) to administer and generally conduct business within The New York Times Company; (3) to prevent fraud; and (4) to conduct our marketing activities.


{removed href} Back to top.


{removed hyperref} About Links to Third-Party Services?


Some Times Services contain links to third-party websites, resources, vendors and advertisers. These third parties are not Times Services. We do not control (and are not responsible for) third party content or privacy practices. Any personal data you provide to them is not covered by this Privacy Policy.


{removed href} Back to top.


{removed hyperref} Are Changes to This Privacy Policy Communicated?


We periodically update this Privacy Policy. We will post any changes on this page by updating this policy.
