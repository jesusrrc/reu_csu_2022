3M United States.


3M Global Privacy Policy.


3M respects your right to privacy. This policy summarizes what personal information we may collect, how we may use this information, and other important topics relating to your privacy and data protection.


It is 3M policy to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws. This commitment reflects the value we place on earning and keeping the trust of our customers, business partners and others who share their personal information with us.


This Policy applies to all Internet sites and mobile applications operated by or on behalf of 3M and includes 3M entities worldwide (each a 3M Internet Site or App). It also applies to personal information 3M may otherwise collect: (i) through our products and services; (ii) when you interact with us by means other than a 3M Internet Site or App, for example, in person, by telephone, or at a trade show or training; and (iii) from our customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners (collectively Business Partners).


However, different 3M Internet Sites, Apps, products, and services have different purposes and features. If additional or different disclosures are required for a specific 3M Internet Site, App, product, or service, then we provide those disclosures separately on, or with, the relevant Internet Site, App, product, or service. Each such specific privacy disclosure, policy, or statement (Specific Privacy Statement) supplements and amends this Policy.

Information about how you interact with us. 3M may collect technical data about your usage of 3M Internet Sites and Apps and how you interact with our digital advertisements and promotions, such as content viewed or downloaded, features used, links clicked, 3M promotional emails opened, and dates and times of interactions. 3M collects this information using cookies and similar technologies.

{number list}.


{list item} COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES:


A cookie is a file of information placed on your device when you visit a website. Cookies and similar technologies can enhance your user experience by saving your preferences, personalizing your online experience, holding items in your shopping cart, and sometimes providing you with advertising which is tailored to your interests.


3M Internet Sites use session cookies. A session cookie does not identify you personally and expires after you close your browser. For example, when you use the 3M Product Catalog, we place a session cookie to note what pages you have viewed. We can use this information to provide you recommendations of other products that may be of interest.


3M Internet Sites also use persistent cookies. These cookies do not expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until you delete them or they expire. By assigning your computer a unique identifier, we are able to create a database of your previous choices and preferences which can be provided by us automatically, saving you time and effort on future visits. For example, after you make a purchase, if you decide to make another purchase, your shipping address may have been retained and will only need to be confirmed.


Certain countries require your consent to the use of cookies when you visit 3M Internet Sites. If you access a 3M Internet Site for one of these countries, you will be presented with information regarding your options, including the option to accept or reject certain categories of cookies. You will be able to change these settings on subsequent visits. Please note that you will not be able to opt out of receiving certain cookies that are strictly necessary for the delivery of a service requested by you.


At any time when visiting a 3M Internet Site for one of these countries, clicking on the Cookie Preferences link at the bottom of each page allows you to access information on cookies and change your settings.


Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit a 3M Internet Site, you may be unable to use all of the functionality of the site if you reject certain cookies.


In addition, your browser may allow you to adjust settings to accept or reject cookies, or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer.


ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING. 3M uses third-party analytics services to better understand how users engage with 3M Internet Sites and Apps, including services provided by Google and Adobe. Please use the following links for more information about how Google and Adobe collect and use data when you visit their partners websites or apps:

{removed href} {removed hyperref}. html.


3M also uses third-party advertising services to provide advertisements for 3M products or services that may be of interest to you when you visit websites or other online services.


3M allows selected third parties, including these analytics and advertising services, to place cookies on our Internet Sites. These third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites.


These third parties may be members of industry self-regulatory groups such as the Network Advertising Initiative {removed href} (NAI) and Digital Advertising Alliance ({removed href} DAA). The websites for these groups provide more information on interest-based online advertising and how to opt out of receiving interest-based online ads from participating companies.


DO NOT TRACK BROWSER SETTINGS. Some browsers may transmit Do Not Track (DNT) signals to the websites you visit. Because there is not common agreement about how to interpret DNT signals, 3M currently does not take action in response to them.
