PRIVACY POLICY.


APPLICABILITY.


Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to Web Sites owned and/or operated by or for Westinghouse Homeware, and upon which Westinghouse Homeware has placed a link which, when clicked, transfers you to this Privacy Policy. It is not applicable to the individual web sites owned, sponsored or operated by or for any independent licensee of Westinghouse Homeware. While on our Web Site, you may encounter links to these or other web sites or online material. If you click on a link to such a third party, the click takes you off our Web Site and to a third partys web site, which is beyond Westinghouse Homewares control. These other web sites may set their own cookies, collect data, and/or have their own privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at the Web Site, and does not cover any information collected by any other web site or offline by Westinghouse Homeware (unless otherwise specifically stated or disclosed by Westinghouse Homeware), its corporate affiliates, broadcast affiliates, distributors or any other company, and we encourage you to review the privacy policy of any other web site you visit.


In addition, please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may disclose publicly in any chat rooms, message boards, or similar web pages. You should keep in mind that whenever you publicly disclose information about yourself online for example, via message boards or chat rooms that information could be collected and used by people that you do not know. In addition, certain message boards and similar user forums may display IP addresses (as defined below) along with the message posters name and message. Westinghouse Homeware bears no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information users may disclose on the message boards, chat areas or other user forums, if any, on the Web Site.

However, there may be times when we ask you to provide us with certain PII, such as when you choose to register with our Web Site and/or for newsletters or choose to participate in an online contest, sweepstakes, survey or voting procedure. We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information or information regarding your interests, hobbies or similar information. Westinghouse Homeware reserves the right, at any time, to add features to our Web Site that require you to register or otherwise provide PII, including credit card information, or to require registration to access our Web Site. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the Web Sites features. We may combine the information we collect with information available from other sources, including information received from promotional partners or other third parties. We may provide you the opportunity to e-mail a friend an article, electronic greeting card or other special feature from our Web Site. The e-mail addresses you supply us for those activities will be used to send the requested e-mail and will not be used to send you or your friend any other e-mail communications.
