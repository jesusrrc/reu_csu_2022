We seek to encrypt credit card numbers from e-commerce transactions conducted on our websites using secure socket layer (SSL) technology.


However, no method of Internet transmission or electronic storage is 100 secure or error-free, so it is not possible to guarantee absolute security. You must protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer, and be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (e. g., if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us by email {removed href} {removed hyperref} or by calling us at {removed href} 1. 314. 679. 8984.

{removed href}.


INTERNATIONAL DATA FLOW.


The Personal Data that we collect or receive about you may be transferred to and/or processed by bodies that are located inside or outside the EEA.


Some of the recipients of your Personal Data (see also below) are located in countries with adequacy decisions (in particular, Canada (for non-public organizations subject to the Canadian Personal Data Protection and Electronic Documents Act) and Argentina), and, in each case, the transfer is thereby recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection from a European data protection law perspective (see Art. 45 General Data Protection Regulation GDPR).


Other recipients might be located in countries which do not adduce an adequate level of protection from a European data protection law perspective (in particular, the USA). We will take all necessary measures to ensure that transfers out of the EEA are adequately protected as required by applicable data protection law. With respect to transfers to countries not providing an adequate level of data protection, we will base the transfer on appropriate safeguards, such as standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission or by a supervisory authority (Art. 46(2) (c) or (d) GDPR), approved codes of conduct together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient (Art. 46 (2) (e) GDPR), or approved certification mechanisms together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient (Art. 46 (2) (f) GDPR). You can ask for a copy of such appropriate safeguards by contacting us as stated above under the section Contacting Us.


COOKIES.


We use cookies, a small text file transferred to your device, along with similar technologies (e. g., internet tag technologies, web beacons and embedded scripts) to help provide you with a better, more personalized user experience. To learn more about how we use cookies and to change your cookie settings, please {removed href} click here.


DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS.


Some internet browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Given that there is not a uniform way that browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal, our websites do not currently interpret, respond to or alter their practices when they receive Do Not Track signals.


GOOGLE RECAPTCHA.


We utilize Google reCAPTCHA, which is a free service that protects websites from spam and abuse using advanced risk analysis techniques to tell humans and bots apart. Google reCAPTCHA works differently depending on what version is deployed. For example, you may be asked to check a box indicating that you are not a robot or Google reCAPTCHA may detect abusive traffic without user interaction. Google reCAPTCHA works by transmitting certain types of information to Google, such as the referrer URL, IP address, visitor behavior, operating system information, browser and length of the visit, cookies, and mouse movements. Your use of Google reCAPTCHA is subject to Googles {removed href} Privacy Policy and {removed href} Terms of Use. More information as to Google reCAPTCHA and how it works is available {removed href} here.

OUR PROCESS FOR VERIFYING A REQUEST TO KNOW OR DELETE.


If we determine that your request is subject to an exemption or exception, we will notify you of our determination. If we determine that your request is not subject to an exemption or exception, we will comply with your request upon verification of your identity and, to the extent applicable, the identity of the California resident on whose behalf you are making such request.


We will verify your identity either to a reasonable degree of certainty or a reasonably high degree of certainty depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information and the risk of harm to you by unauthorized disclosure or deletion as applicable.


For requests to access categories of Personal Information and for requests to delete Personal Information that is not sensitive and does not pose a risk of harm by unauthorized deletion, we will verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty by verifying at least two data points that you previously provided to us and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying identities.


For requests to access specific pieces of Personal Information or for requests to delete Personal Information that is sensitive and poses a risk of harm by unauthorized deletion, we will verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty by verifying at least three pieces of Personal Information previously provided to us and which we have determined to be reliable the purpose of verifying identities. In addition, you will be required to submit a signed declaration under penalty of perjury stating that you are the individual whose Personal Information is being requested.


AUTHORIZED AGENTS.
