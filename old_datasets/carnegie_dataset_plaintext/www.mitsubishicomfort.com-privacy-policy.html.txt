Children.


The Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), as well as various other state laws, prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with the collection, use, and/or disclosure of personal information from and about children on the Internet.

You have the right to request the disclosure of your personal information in our possession and mandate revisions when necessary. METUS offers you ways to update and/or to delete incorrect information, barring the need to retain it for legitimate business or legal purposes. In order to update your personal information, METUS may, for your personal protection, require you to verify your identity before we honor the request. In cases where the request is unreasonably repetitive, requires disproportionate technical effort, risks the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, METUS may reject the request and work with you to find an alternative solution. Please note that requests made over the phone may be recorded to ensure proper response to your request.


To request more details about the personal information that you directly provided to METUS, click the appropriate web link above or contact METUS at 1-833-638-1096 for assistance. Please note that we require certain pieces of personal information, such as name, and email address or telephone number in order to find you in our systems. This may be more information than we have collected previously. METUS will respond to any such request in an appropriate manner and within a reasonable timeframe.


METUS operates in such a way to protect information from accidental or malicious destruction. As such, subsequent to your request to delete personal information from our system, we reserve the right to retain residual copies from our active servers for a short period of time and may not remove information from our backup systems.


Metahvac Ads And Offerings On Third-Party Websites.


METUS may contract with service providers to place ads on websites owned by third parties. In addition, some websites may be powered by a service provider to provide METUS offers on METUSs behalf. These service providers may send cookies and use web beacons on these third-party websites and on our Sites. The cookies and web beacons may enable METUS to collect information about the pages you viewed and the links you clicked.


Most web browsers offer you the ability to inform websites and ad networks that you do not want your online activities tracked through a Do Not Track feature. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a Do Not Track signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what Do Not Track means in this context. Like many online services, METUS does not currently alter its practices when it receives a Do Not Track signal from a visitors browser.


To find out more about Do Not Track, you can visit {removed href} {removed hyperref}/ (link is external) to learn more about network advertising and your choices for opting out. However, METUS is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their tracking technologies. METUS is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of third party choice notices or choice mechanisms.
