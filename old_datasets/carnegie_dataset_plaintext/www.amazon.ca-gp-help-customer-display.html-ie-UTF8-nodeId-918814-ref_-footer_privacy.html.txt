We do not use information that personally identifies you to display interest-based ads. To learn more, please read our {removed href} Interest-Based Ads policy.

Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information?


Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling our customers personal information to others. We share customers personal information only as described below and with subsidiaries {removed hyperref}, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.


{number list}.


{list item} TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THIRD PARTIES. We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can order products from third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customers personal information related to those transactions with that third party.


{list item} THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.


{list item} BUSINESS TRANSFERS. As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that {removed hyperref}, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.


{list item} PROTECTION OF AMAZON AND OTHERS. We disclose account and other personal information when we believe disclosing is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our {removed href} Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.


Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.


{removed href}.


How Secure Is Information About Me?


We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.


{number list}.


{list item} We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.


{list item} We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.


{list item} We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of personal customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.


{list item} Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs. {removed href} Click here for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device.


{list item} It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. {removed href} Click here for more information on how to sign off.

What About Advertising?


{number list}.


{list item} THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISERS AND LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES. Amazon Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising at Amazon, including interest-based ads, please read our {removed href} Interest-Based Ads policy. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the {removed href} Advertising Preferences page.


{list item} USE OF THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING SERVICES. We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other device identifier. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the {removed href} Advertising Preferences page.


{removed href}.


What Information Can I Access?

{number list}.


{list item} As described above, you can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of the Amazon Services.


{list item} You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in {removed href} What Information Can I Access?. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.


{list item} If you do not want to receive email or other communications from us, please adjust your {removed href} Customer Communication Preferences. If you dont want to receive in-app notifications from us, please adjust your notification settings in the app or device.


{list item} If you do not want to see interest-based ads, please adjust your {removed href} Advertising Preferences.


{list item} The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies or other identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to block cookies altogether. Because cookies and identifiers allow you to take advantage of some essential features of Amazon Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Services that require you to Sign in. For more information about cookies and other identifiers, see our {removed href} Cookies Notice.


{list item} If you want to browse our websites without linking the browsing history to your account, you may do so by logging out of your account {removed href} here and blocking cookies on your browser.


{list item} You will also be able to opt out of certain other types of data usage by updating your settings on the applicable Amazon website (e. g., in Manage Your Content and Devices), device, or application. For more information {removed href} click here. Most non-Amazon devices also provide users with the ability to change device permissions (e. g., disable/access location services, contacts). For most devices, these controls are located in the devices settings menu. If you have questions about how to change your device permissions on devices manufactured by third parties, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.


{list item} If you are a seller, you can add or update certain information in {removed href} Seller Central, update your account information by accessing your {removed href} Seller Account Information, and adjust your email or other communications you receive from us by updating your {removed href} Notification Preferences.


{list item} If you are an author, you can add or update the information you have provided in the {removed href} Author Portal and {removed href} Author Central by accessing your accounts in the Author Portal and Author Central, respectively.


In addition, to the extent required by applicable law, you may have the right to request access to or delete your personal data. If you wish to do any of these things, please contact {removed href} Customer Service. Depending on your data choices, certain services may be limited or unavailable.
