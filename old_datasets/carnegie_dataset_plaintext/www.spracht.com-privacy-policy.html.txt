information with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about.


your use of our website in a manner that does not identify you. You can disable cookies.


at any time by using your browser options; however, if you turn off cookies, we will not.


be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our website. In.

SECURITY.


We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality.


and security of personally identifiable information transmitted to us using this website.


To guard your information, our website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts.


your credit card number, name and address so only Spracht is able to decode your.

secure means of transmitting credit card information.

Business Transitions.


As we continue to develop our business, we may undergo a business transition such as.


acquiring another company, merging with an existing company, or selling a portion of.


our assets. In such transitions, customer information is typically one of the business.


assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. In the unlikely event that Spracht.


or substantially all of its assets are acquired or enter a court proceeding, you.


acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that your Personal Information can.


continue to be used as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

This policy replaces all previous disclosures we may have provided you about our.


information practices. We reserve the right to change this policy, and to apply any.


changes to information previously collected, as permitted by law. If there are material.
