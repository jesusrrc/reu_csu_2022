If you are concerned about receiving cookies from websites, you can set your browser to disable this feature or to notify you when they are sent. Disabling the reception of cookies may limit your access to portions of our website.


Fair Information Practices.


Fair Information Practices principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States, and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding Fair Information Practice principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.


In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, should a data breach occur, we will notify users via email within seven (7) business days. We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.


CalOPPA (California Online Privacy Protection Act).


CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The laws reach stretches beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting PII from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.

The Federal Trade Commission, the nations consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect childrens privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under 13.
