Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:


{number list}.

LAWFUL BASIS.


For AO to be allowed to process your personal data, we must have a legal basis for the processing. The data protection legislation sets out what these bases are. We have described below the different bases that we rely on and provided examples of the processing.


{number list}.


{list item} LEGITIMATE INTEREST means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us. If you do not want us to process any of the personal data we have listed as being processed for legitimate interests, you have the right to object. For more information see the section below relating to your rights. Please note that if you object we may still continue to process your personal data in certain circumstances. Please also remember that if we cant process your personal data for these purposes your customer experience may not be as enjoyable.


{list item} PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACT means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract. For example when you buy a product or service on any of our Sites, it creates a contract between us. We need to process your personal data that you provide in the order to fulfil our part of the contract and deliver the products to you. If you do not provide your details we wont be able to complete your order.


{list item} COMPLY WITH A LEGAL OBLIGATION means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to. For example, if you buy a product which is an age restricted item (such as a game rated 18) or if there is a product recall.


{list item} CONSENT means processing your personal data where you have explicitly told us that you will allow us to do so. In some cases, we will ask whether you would like us to process your personal data. For example, when an item is out of stock and you provide your telephone number for us to call to discuss available alternatives or notify you when the out of stock item becomes available. If you provide us with consent, you may withdraw it at any time by contacting us.


PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE WILL USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA.


We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are, where appropriate.

We retain your transaction data for a period of ten years after your purchase, this is a requirement inline with certain product liability provisions under the Consumer Protection Act 1987.


If you call or message our contact centre with an enquiry (but do not place an order) we will keep your personal data for one month.


If you ask us to notify you about an out of stock item, we will do so if it becomes available within one month of your request.


If you receive marketing emails and SMS from us and have not unsubscribed from these messages we will continue to process your personal data for this purpose for a maximum period of four years. You may ask us to stop processing for this purpose at any time.


In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS below for further information.


In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.


Your legal rights.


Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.


You have the right to:


REQUEST ACCESS to your personal data (commonly known as a data subject access request). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.


REQUEST CORRECTION of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.


REQUEST ERASURE of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.


OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.


REQUEST RESTRICTION OF PROCESSING of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:


{number list}.


{list item} If you want us to establish the datas accuracy.


{list item} Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.


{list item} Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.


{list item} You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.


REQUEST THE TRANSFER of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.


WITHDRAW CONSENT AT ANY TIME where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.


If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at {removed href} {removed hyperref}.


NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED.


You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.


WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU.


We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.


TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND.


We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
