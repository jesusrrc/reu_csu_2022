This may include capturing and making available to you portions of the recording data as part of a notification or analysis of the data to identify motion or other events.

SIMPLISAFE PRODUCT OR ACCOUNT INTERACTION WITH THIRD PARTIES.


If SimpliSafe offers any product or account connections or integrations with third-party products, applications, functionality, or services (collectively, Third-Party Products and Services), and you choose to enable or connect to such Third-Party Products and Services through the means authorized and directed by SimpliSafe and/or such third-party partners, you acknowledge and agree that we may share certain information about you with such third parties for account authentication and management, and to enable the activation, connection and integration with and to such Third-Party Products and Services on such third parties platforms. For example, when you elect to use Third-Party Products and Services, such as SimpliSafes Amazon Alexa Skill, the August Smart Lock, Apple Watch or Google Assistant (as and when each is introduced), you agree that we may provide certain data about you to such partners in order to enable the activation, connection and integration with and to such Third-Party Products and Services you intend to use or otherwise choose to activate. In some cases, SimpliSafe or the third-party partner will instead (or also) ask for permission to control the SimpliSafe products and services and/or Third-Party Products and Services that you have activated and connected to as contemplated hereunder. Your consent is required to allow any of these exchanges or requests for control and you will be able to revoke or disable it at any time.


In addition, SimpliSafe may share information with such third-party partners with your permission. For example, when you enroll or activate Third-Party Products and Services, you may be asked for your permission to share certain data between SimpliSafe and our partner. SimpliSafe requires your consent before sharing information in these circumstances. We may also receive information from our partners and other sources and combine that with the information in your SimpliSafe account to determine eligibility and efficacy of our programs.


Additional information about the limited circumstances in which information from your SimpliSafe account may be shared with third parties is described below in the section titled How we Use and Share Your Information.


Any SimpliSafe data that you choose to share with a third party, either directly or by or on behalf of SimpliSafe through the authorizations, integrations and connections permitted hereunder, is governed by that third partys privacy policy while in that partys possession.


Any data that SimpliSafe receives from third parties will be processed and stored by SimpliSafe and will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This information may be processed in the same ways as any other data that is a part of your SimpliSafe account.


NO INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN OR TEENS UNDER AGE 18.


This Site is not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from, children or teenagers under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register with us at this Site or provide any personal information about yourself to us.

THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SOCIAL MEDIA.


Our Site may contain links to other websites operated by third parties and may include social media features such as Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest buttons or links. These third-party sites may collect information about you if you click on a link and the social media sites may automatically record information about your browsing behavior every time you visit a site that has a social media button.

3. HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION.


TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND INFORMATION.


As described above, we collect information from you so that we can provide products and services that you purchase from us, and to provide information that you request from us. This includes sending you alarm alerts and important service information about your alarm and our services. We use your personal information to contact you about your orders, process credit card / debit card transactions, and ship our products to you. We may send you information about our products and services, and new offerings. We may provide information to third party service providers that help us process orders and fulfill and deliver products and services that you purchase from us. You may opt out of receiving future communications (with the exception of alarm alerts and service information) from us by logging into your account and editing your profile. You may also opt out of receiving commercial e-mail from us by following the instructions in each e-mail. To ensure reliability and improve your experience with our mobile app, we share information with Google Firebase to measure your in-app experience and improve its usability, speed, and reliability; only non-personally identifiable information is shared.


If you subscribe for monitoring services, or make other purchases through the Site, your credit card or debit card information (such as card type and expiration date) and other financial data that we need to process your payment may be collected and stored by the payment processors with which we work. We may also collect some limited information, such as your postal code, mobile number, and details of your transaction history, all of which are necessary to provide the monitoring services or products. In addition, the payment processors generally provide us with some limited information related to you, such as a unique token that enables you to make additional purchases using the information theyve stored, including recurring payments if you become a subscriber, and your cards type, expiration date, and certain digits of your card number.


We use third parties to assist with providing our products and services to you (including our alarm monitoring services and dispatching emergency responders), host our Site, send out email updates about the Site, provide marketing and advertising services for us, remove repetitive information from our user lists, and process payments. These service providers will have access to your personal information in order to provide these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to help us provide the service. We also employ strong security and technological controls and provisions to protect against unauthorized SimpliSafe employee access to the audio and video data collected from your security camera or other camera-enabled products.


ADVERTISING.


We may use how you browse and shop in order to show you ads for SimpliSafe or our advertising partners that are more relevant to your interests. We may use cookies and other information to provide relevant interest-based advertising to you. Interest-based ads are ads presented to you based on your browsing behavior in order to provide you with ads more tailored to your interests. These interest-based ads may be presented to you while you are browsing our Site or third-party sites not owned by SimpliSafe.


We belong to ad networks that may use your browsing history across participating websites to show you interest-based advertisements on those websites. Our Site does not respond to do not track signals or similar mechanisms to indicate you do not wish to be tracked or receive interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based advertisements and your opt-out rights and options, visit the {removed href} Digital Advertising Alliance and the {removed href} Network Advertising Initiative websites ({removed href} {removed hyperref} and {removed href} {removed hyperref}).
