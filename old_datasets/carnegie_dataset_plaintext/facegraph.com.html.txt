Great product! Very convenient to use and works as advertised. To make sure its really working and not a toy, I actually try to use both extremely cold and hot objects and both of them seemed to be identified. It may not by very accurate due to its working mechanism but it is still a good product with good first order accuracy.

Purchased this for a laboratory that I manage. Its been incredible! Its helped us get people in the building safely each day. The staff finds comfort knowing their peers came to work and had an acceptable temperature upon arrival. Its easy to mount on a wall and get going immediately. With help from the support team for the smile me in portal I created an online account where all temperature checks are uploaded for review by the manager. Their support team is absolutely wonderful! I would highly suggest this for your place of business, school, gym, anything. You wont regret the spend!

Temperature sensor is responsive and quick. We did have some issues with incorrect readings if the ambient temperature in the room is too hot. We purchased four of them and used them to process around 400 employees daily. It takes a couple of seconds a piece.

Want a temperature scanner that DOESNT look and feel like a refurbished smartphone with an external camera attached? We did too and immediately ordered 3 more direct from FaceGraph after our initial testing. We will likely order more to cover additional office entryways. So far Im very impressed.

We use this in our business to screen people before they enter. We have actually turned away a few people who were above normal. The stand upon which it lives is sturdy, the scanner is solid and easy to use.
