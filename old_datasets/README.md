# Other Datasets

This folder contains the datasets used to compare our own dataset. By the end of the project, this folder should contain up to two folders.
One folder should store the datasets in the CSV form, whereas the other folder stores the datasets in their original form, as some datasets
are not available as CSV files by default. Particularly, this folder includes these datasets:

* OPP 115 dataset (https://www.usableprivacy.org/data).
* Purpose-Extraction dataset (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2021/5552501/).
* REU@CSU 2021 team's dataset.
* Carnegie-Mellon's dataset (https://sc.cs.cmu.edu/research-detail/73-usable-privacy-policy-project).
